<p>I like the ofb site, and the fetishes within. However, I found it lacking in usability, and has not appeared to be maintained in some time. There are different ways I would like to browse the stories. An example of a good presentation is AO3. This site also attempts to convert and provide a consistent, desired text format for reading (be it pdf, text, epub)</p>
<p>This site temorarily scans the original to pull new uploads, and presents them in an alternative manner</p>
