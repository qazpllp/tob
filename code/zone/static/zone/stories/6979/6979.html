<p>By Nightshade </p>
<p>Author’s Note: </p>
<p>This story is a writeup of a playtest session of a transformation based card game I am working 
on, so the narrative and the style of the transformations might be a bit more random than you are 
used  to.  Still,  I  think  it  flows  pretty  well.  Please  leave  feedback,  and  if  you  liked  it  enough  to 
want more, or have a suggestion for who should draw from the deck next, please let me know!  </p>
<p>Obviously contains adult fetish material and sexual situations, proceed at your own risk.  </p>
<p>Thanks for reading! </p>
<p>Prologue </p>
<p>Sarah was beginning to grow increasingly frustrated with the California lifestyle. It was a 
feeling that had been growing in her mind for a few months, but had come to a head in the last 
half hour. </p>
<p>She had moved out to Los Angeles after graduating college, doing her post graduate work 
at  a  high  priced  Southern  California  medical  school.  As  the  years  dragged  on,  she  became 
increasingly  bored  with  the  work,  and  had  decided  to  pursue  a  career  in  acting.  Still,  it  was  a 
competitive field and she had little success despite her good looks; mostly a few small roles in B 
movies  and  student  films.  As  graduation  drew  nearer,  she  found  herself  contemplating  simply 
giving up and moving back home; she knew that she couldn’t possibly pursue acting at the same 
time  as  a  medical  internship,  there  just  weren’t  enough  hours  in  the  day.  Besides,  her  parents 
wouldn’t continue to pay for her expensive LA rent if she chose to forego her medical career and 
spend her days as a wannabee actress. </p>
<p>Today, all that tension had come to a head. She had gotten a text from her agent  telling 
her that he had managed to  get  her a last  minute audition,  and  Sarah had quickly gotten ready 
and rushed to the address, which, as far as she could tell, didn’t exist.  Her phone sent her to a 
building  that  just  wasn’t  there.  She  confirmed  the  address,  and  then  spent  the  next  hour 
searching, growing more and more frustrated as she went in circles. About half an hour ago she 
had  had  enough,  and  decided  that  if  this  role  didn’t  pan  out  for  her,  she  was  done  with 
Hollywood, and would be leaving California as soon as she graduated. </p>
<p>Eventually she decided to park her car and try and find the place on foot. And that was 
how  she  found  herself  walking  down  a  narrow  alleyway  between  the  buildings  that  her  phone 
said should be on either side of the casting agency. She rounded a corner and saw an unmarked 
door with a short woman standing outside of it. </p>
<p>“You here for the audition?” Sarah asked. </p>
<p>“Yes,” the other woman nodded. </p>
<p>“Me too,” Sarah responded as she stuck out her hand and introduced herself. </p>
<p>“Mary,” said the shorter woman as she took her hand. Sarah’s heart sank; she knew that if this 
was her competition, one of them would be sorely disappointed. </p>
<p>Both  were  pretty  girls,  with  fair  skin  and  dark  hair,  but  that  was  where  the  similarities </p>
<p>ended. </p>
<p>Sarah was tall and athletic, nearly six feet in height, although she always listed her height 
as 5’10, as she had quickly learned that anything taller was too threatening for a woman. She had 
a slender figure, with toned muscles, broad shoulders, and narrow hips. She had a square jaw, her 
dark  hair  was  cut  short,  and  her  eyes  were  a  pale  blue.  She  was  slender,  with  perky  B-cup 
breasts, and the only real fat on her body was her thick thighs and cute heart shaped ass. She was 
dressed in a violet tank top and dark grey leggings, with black leather ankle boots. </p>
<p>Mary, on the other hand, had an oval shaped face with full lips and dark green eyes; she 
wore heavy glasses and her hair was pulled back in a ponytail. She was short and curvy, a few 
pounds away from pudgy, with a round bubble butt and a pair of full C-cup breasts that looked 
even larger on her tiny body. She was almost five years younger than Sarah, and was dressed in a 
baggy pink sweatshirt, faded blue jeans, and a pair of old gray sneakers. </p>
<p>Mary had come to California to attend film school, with the hope of one day becoming a 
famous  director,  but  after  receiving  a  lot  of  praise  narrating  her  own  student  projects,  she  had 
decided to  give  acting a try, mostly  to  get  her name out  there, but  the fame or the money that 
could come along with it didn’t hurt either. </p>
<p>“This the place?” Sarah asked, and Mary responded “I think so.” Sarah opened the door and held 
it open for Mary to enter first. </p>
<p>They were smiling at one another as they headed inside, but both women had made the 
conscious  decision  not  to  like  one  another,  as  they  might  soon  find  themselves  in  direct 
competition for the same part. </p>
<p>The Shuffle </p>
<p>This  was  not  your  typical  casting  office.  It  was  a  small  dark  room,  lit  only  by  a  single 
lamp which hung like a spotlight above a large round table in its center. The room’s edges were 
cluttered, but in the gloom it was impossible to tell by what.  </p>
<p>A  woman  sat  on  the  far  side  of  the  table.  She  was  pale  and  thin,  middle  aged  with  a 
motherly  look  about  her.  Her  orange  hair  was  pulled  back  tight,  her  eyes  were  rimmed  with 
smoky makeup, and she was dressed in a modest and somehow antiquated black dress. </p>
<p>She gestured for the young actresses to  take a seat  and welcomed them in  a soft voice. 
Sarah and Mary, too stunned to protest, sat down across from one another, Mary on the woman’s 
right and Sarah to her left. </p>
<p>“We’re here for an audition. Is this the right place?” Sarah asked. </p>
<p>“Yes and no,” the woman replied, “It’s not an audition per se, but you will be taking on a new 
role, and you may well win the fame and fortune you desire. Or maybe not. Regardless, you are 
exactly where you are supposed to be.” </p>
<p>The girls were puzzled, but this wasn’t the most unusual thing they had seen in LA, so 
they played along. Suddenly, the woman was shuffling a deck of oversized playing cards, their 
backs yellowed with age and covered in  a strange swirling design reminiscent of yin and yang 
patterns. </p>
<p>“Oh,” Sarah said, “Are you a fortune teller?” </p>
<p>“Something like that,” the redhead said quietly as a small smile crossed her thin lips. </p>
<p>“We need to go then,” Mary cut in, “We have an audition soon, and we still don’t know where it 
is.” </p>
<p>“This won’t take long” the dealer said, in a soothing voice. “Oh,” Mary exhaled and settled down 
in the low backed leather chair. </p>
<p>“Before we start, I must tell you that this is not a standard deck. A normal tarot deck can only tell 
your  future,  and  to  be  honest,  most  of  them  can’t  even  do  that.  This  one  will  actually  change 
your fate, in both direction, and there are absolutely no returns. Once a card is drawn, it cannot 
be undone. Do you agree?” </p>
<p>“I guess…” Sarah said hesitantly. </p>
<p>“Sure…” Mary said mockingly. </p>
<p>across from one another. </p>
<p>A strange sensation filled the room, and then settled upon the two young women who sat </p>
<p>Suddenly, Sarah squeaked as she felt a sharp pain in her ears. She brought her hands up 
to the sides of her head, but the pain was gone as quickly as it had arrived. When she pulled her 
hands away, she saw a half dozen small metal rings in them, which she quickly recognized as the </p>
<p>earrings she had been wearing. She ran a finger along the outer edge of her ear, and found only 
smooth flesh. </p>
<p>“What the…?” </p>
<p>The  dealer  dismissed  her  concern  and  stated  matter-of-factly  “The  Deck  wants  a  blank 
canvas  to  work  with.  It  heals  you  before  the  game,  and  then  if  it  decides  it  likes  you  pierced, 
pierced you will be forevermore.” </p>
<p>Before  either  of  her  guests  could  fully  process  what  she  meant  or  how  this  was 
happening,  she  finished  her  shuffle  and  laid  the  deck  upon  the  table  in  front  of  her.  Then,  she 
flipped the top card over in front of Sarah. </p>
<p>“The game begins.” </p>
<p>Round One </p>
<p>The  card  showed  a  drawing  in  the  style  of  a  nineteenth  century  woodcut,  although 
painted in vibrant colors. It depicted a very young woman of indeterminate ethnicity and with a 
mouth  full  of  predatory  fangs.  She  was  looking down  in  horror  at  a  golden  basin  filled  with  a 
liquid  that  was  too  red  to  be  wine.  Across  the  bottom  of  the  card  was  written  the  words  The 
Vampyre. </p>
<p>“A very special card to begin with. This card does almost nothing on its own, but instead </p>
<p>will steal whatever fate the deck decides to bless your opponent with.” </p>
<p>Mary  looked  up  at  Sarah,  and  briefly  noticed  that  the  woman’s  canine  teeth  seemed </p>
<p>especially  long  and  sharp,  but  her  musing  was  interrupted  by  the  dealer  turning  to  her  and 
flipping over another card and laying it down on the table. </p>
<p>It  depicted  an  image  of  an  impossibly  tall  man,  so  large  that  his  head  was  lost  in  the </p>
<p>clouds, and his back foot disappeared over the horizon. He was boldly striding forward, heedless 
of the agrarian countryside that he trampled beneath his immense feet. The Colossus. </p>
<p>Nothing  happened  for  a  moment,  and  then  Mary  noticed  that  her  point  of  view  was </p>
<p>dropping as the room seemed to stretch about her. As she saw the other women looking down at 
her, she realized that she was shrinking. </p>
<p>At the same time, Sarah was growing larger by an equal amount. Her clothes grew tight </p>
<p>on her expanding frame as she looked down upon the table. </p>
<p>The change stopped quickly, and the effect was not too terribly severe, but both women 
felt panic rise in their hearts. Their new perspectives made them feel like freaks, and in unison 
they  wondered  why  the  cards  couldn’t  have  been  drawn  the  other  way  around!  If  Mary  had 
stolen some of Sarah’s height, they would both be normal. Now, the already tall girl was nearly 
six and a half feet, while the shorter woman would need high heels to reach five, and maybe not 
even then. </p>
<p>They  both  panicked,  and  their  minds  were  filled  with  a  rush  of  thoughts,  the  two  most </p>
<p>prominent among them being “This is impossible,” and “I have to get away!” </p>
<p>But  before their panic addled bodies could  rise  from  the table, their new reality  seeped 
into  their  minds.  It  was  subtle  and  insidious,  but  still  forceful.  They  both  grew  calm  as  their 
memories adjusted, giving them an entire lifetime to get used to their new heights. </p>
<p>Sarah  could  remember  years  of  being  teased  at  school  for  being  taller  than  any  of  the 
boys in her school, and then of moving to Hollywood and being told again and again that there 
were  no  parts  for  women  her  size.  Mary  remembered  endless  short  jokes,  of  not  being  taken 
seriously, of boys literally picking her up, and of her friends treating her like a living doll. </p>
<p>This was their new normal. </p>
<p>Round Two </p>
<p>The  next  card  to  be  drawn  showed  a  brightly  wrapped  box  left  anonymously  on  a </p>
<p>doorstep of a rundown house in the middle the night. Generosity it read. </p>
<p>“Another special card,” the dealer said  flatly.  “Whatever card I draw next will apply to </p>
<p>both of you equally. And without missing a beat, she did so. </p>
<p>The card showed a group of old men, gazing lustfully at a  very young girl who walked </p>
<p>innocently down the street in front of them, dressed in an archaic school uniform. The Maiden. </p>
<p>Suddenly, both Mary and Sarah felt a rush of vitality as the last ten years of their lives </p>
<p>were washed away. </p>
<p>Sarah’s skin grew tauter and the care lines on her face faded away. Her slender physique 
filled out slightly with baby fat, and her cheek and collar bones faded from view. When it was 
done, she looked like a girl who had just graduated high school, the picture of vibrant youth and 
health. </p>
<p>The change was more dramatic on Mary, who had been younger to start with. Her oval 
face narrowed, and youthful freckles appeared across her cheeks and the bridge of her nose. Her 
figure  slimmed  slightly,  and  she  felt  a  curious  tingle  as  the  stubble  on  her  legs  and  armpits 
vanished,  and  then  a  more  intense  one  between  her  legs  as  her  dark  bush  of  pubic  hair  was 
replaced  with  a  thin  fuzz,  and  her  ponytail  divided  into  a  pair  of  schoolgirl  pigtails.  Whereas 
Sarah looked like she had just graduated high school, Mary looked like she had yet to start it. </p>
<p>Sarah’s mind reworked itself. Memories of college and med school faded away like mist. 
In her mind, she had come to California at the end of her senior year, and convinced her parents 
to pay for her to try and break into acting before starting her pre-med courses the following year. </p>
<p>For Mary, the change involved the loss of many pivotal moments in her life. Graduating 
from high school and college, her first job, her acceptance to film school, learning to drive, her 
first serious boyfriend, and even leaving her parents house to live alone for the first time. In her 
new  reality,  she  was  on  summer  vacation  to  Disneyland  with  her  parents  and  had  snuck  away 
while touring Hollywood. </p>
<p>Round Three </p>
<p>“This next draw will determine your style,” the dealer intoned, as if reading from a script. </p>
<p>She flipped two cards and set one down in front of each of them. </p>
<p>Sarah’s  card  showed  an  image  of  the  Santa  Cruz  beach  boardwalk  as  it  had  been  a 
hundred years ago, an old fashioned wooden carnival built along the sea, with happy people in 
old  fashioned  swimwear  playing  in  the  surf  in  front  of  it.  Text  looped  around  the  base  of  the 
card, reading I Wish They All Could be California Girls.” </p>
<p>“What  a  weird  deck,”  Sarah  mused  aloud,  “nineteenth  century  art,  an  image  from  the </p>
<p>early twentieth, and a song lyric from the sixties.” </p>
<p>The  dealer  said  something  about  the  card  changing  itself  over  time,  but  Sarah  wasn’t 
really  listening  anymore,  her  whole  life  was  too  busy  being  overwritten,  and  conflicting 
memories  fighting  for  a  place  in  her  mind.  When  it  was  over,  all  she  ever  remembered  was 
growing up here in Southern California, born and raised. Hoping since childhood to be an actress 
or a doctor, like her heroes on TV. </p>
<p>She looked down  again, “Oh,  I get  it. Like the  Katy  Parry song. Cool!” She said  in  an 
exaggerated  Valley  Girl  accent  that  would  be  her  only  manner  of  speaking  from  now  on,  that 
would see people treating her like a reject from the set of Clueless wherever she want. </p>
<p>At the same time, Mary’s card showed a gloomy woman sitting in a corner, dark shadows </p>
<p>covering her face like a veil. The Mourner, it read. </p>
<p>Suddenly,  her  entire  ensemble  changed.  Her  makeup  grew  dark  and  exaggerated,  black 
circles  of  eyeliner  forming  around  her  eyes,  like  a  young  girl  without  much  experience  in 
makeup  trying  to  look  oh  so  very  Goth,  and  her  skin  grew  pale  as  her  foundation  changed  to 
match. </p>
<p>Her pink sweater changed into a black corset with silver studs, which left her shoulders 
bare and her pale breasts sticking out proudly. Her pants changed into a voluminous black skirt, 
and her sneakers into a pair of black leather platform boots. </p>
<p>Mary felt her glasses vanish, and when her vision refocused a moment later she saw her 
arms were now ghostly pale. When she saw Sarah’s eyes widen in surprise, she pulled a compact 
out of her purse to evaluate the damage. When she saw her racoon eyes looking back at her, she 
immediately tried to wipe some of the excess makeup away, but it was no use. </p>
<p>“Changes cannot be returned.” The dealer admonished. </p>
<p>“So I’m stuck this way?” Mary pouted. </p>
<p>“Afraid so,” said the dealer. </p>
<p>“This  game’s  dumb,”  the  tiny  Goth  said  in  a  soft  sulky  voice  that  would  become  her 
normal  way  of  speaking,  and  she  slouched  back  in  her  chair,  her  pale  face  now  barely  visible 
above the lip of the table. </p>
<p>Mary hated this game. She hated this whole stupid trip. She had thought it was fun to get 
away from hick-town, but she hadn’t counted on the sun, or the noise, or being forced to spend 
so much time with her family. It was their fault she had snuck away, and it was their fault she 
was being forced to play this stupid game and being transformed into somebody else. </p>
<p>Round Four </p>
<p>“And,  as  the  last  round  determined  your  new  style,  the  next  cards  will  tell  of  your </p>
<p>background,” she said in the same monotone voice, and flipped another pair. </p>
<p>Sarah’s  card  showed  a  redheaded  woman  sitting  on  a  grassy  hillside,  looking  forlornly </p>
<p>out over the sea. It read The Luck of the Irish. </p>
<p>Sarah didn’t notice as small patches of orange-brown freckles appeared on every exposed </p>
<p>portion of her already fair skin, or when her eyes changed from the grey blue of the morning sky 
to a brilliant  emerald green. Nor did she notice as her dark hair was changed into a cheap dye 
job, with her red roots clearly visible beneath.  </p>
<p>Mary  noticed  all  of  this,  but  was  far  too  busy  reacting  to  her  own  changes  to  say 
anything. Her card depicted a group of Spanish conquistadors emerging from the trees to gaze in 
wonder at a young woman swimming nude in a clear pool, her beautiful brown skin standing in 
sharp contrast to their own pallid features, and her long black hair floating about her like a silky 
cloud. It read Native Born. </p>
<p>Mary suddenly felt her facial features swimming, as her eyes took on a beautiful almond 
shape and her cheekbones became more prominent. Her hair straightened and took on a glossy 
black sheen. She assumed that her skin had also taken on a coppery shade, but beneath the thick 
alabaster foundation that she always wore, it would be impossible to tell. </p>
<p>Her  head  swam  as  she  remembered  growing  up  on  Cherokee  tribal  land  in  North 
Carolina, but fought it away. Her parents weren’t Indians, they were white trash. Weren’t they? 
She tried to clear her head, but couldn’t, and sank deeper into her pout. </p>
<p>Round Five </p>
<p>Sarah was eager to draw again. She wasn’t sure how the game worked, but judging by the 
look on Mary’s face, she was winning, and that was good enough for her. The dealer turned over 
the  next  card  and  revealed  a  mannequin  sitting  in  the  window  of  an  abandoned  store.  It  was 
draped in expensive and utterly fashionable clothes, and though it was obviously the work of a 
master craftsman, there was something off-putting about its beautiful but not quite human face. 
The card read The Doll. </p>
<p>Suddenly, Sarah’s entire person changed. Her tank top and leggings were gone, replaced 
by an expensive dress with a flowing violet pattern that darkened as it reached the bottom of her 
short skirt. Her black leather boots grew fancier and morphed into the product of an expensive 
designer that charged nearly a thousand dollars a pair. </p>
<p>Her face became far prettier and more feminine, but there was something oddly artificial 
about it. Her makeup grew nearly as thick as Mary’s, though it was obviously applied with far 
greater skill. Her glossy pink lips swelled up with collagen until they were bigger and fuller than 
Mary’s, but with an unnaturally puffy pout to them. </p>
<p>All  of  the  hair  below  Sarah’s  neck  disappeared,  as  if  the  victim  of  dozens  of  sessions 
beneath the beautician’s laser. Then her nails transformed into a pair of long red press-ons, and 
her  eye  lashes  became  long  and  dark  with  luxurious  extensions  that  she  would  never  again  be 
able to  remove. Her short hair morphed into a three hundred dollar cut,  and the cheap dye job 
was replaced by a jet-black coif; flawless but far too dark to be natural. </p>
<p>The most dramatic change was her chest, which ballooned outwards into a perfect pair of 
double  D-cups  that  were  so  round  and  sat  so  high  on  her  chest  that  they  were  obviously  fake. 
Sarah stared down  at  them  in  confusion,  and brought  her hands up  and  cupped them, gripping 
tight enough for her to feel the silicone implants within squishing beneath her fingertips. </p>
<p>“Where did these come from?” She wondered, and then she remembered. Her daddy had 
bought them for her when she thirteen and hadn’t been developing as fast as some of the other 
girls in her class. She still thought they were the nicest thing anyone had ever gotten her, and she 
smiled happily at the way they bounced when she let them go. Her dad had paid top dollar for 
them,  to  leave  her  without  scars  and  to  retain  that  natural  jiggle,  and  they  were  worth  every 
penny. </p>
<p>Sarah  thought  back  over  her  childhood,  about  how  competitive  she  had  been  with  the 
other  girls,  and  how  she  always  had  to  have  the  best.  She  always  wore  the  most  expensive 
clothes,  the  most  expensive  shoes,  and  most  makeup,  always  had  to  have  the  latest  style.  She 
didn’t have many close friends, but everyone at school had always described the tall girl in the 
same way: fashionably fake. </p>
<p>Sarah  had  always  been  obsessed  with  cosmetic  surgery,  and  had  had  dozens  of 
procedures done in the last few months to giver her the perfect features. If her dreams of acting 
didn’t  pan  out,  she  planned  to  go  to  medical  school  and  become  a  cosmetic  surgeon  herself, 
helping other girls to stay in LA and live that perfect Hollywood lifestyle. </p>
<p>Mary’s  changes  were  less  far  reaching,  but  far  more  noticeable  at  a  glance.  Her  card 
showed a mature woman with small children looking up at her, sitting on her lap or napping with 
their head’s resting on her generous breasts. The Matron. </p>
<p>Mary’s chest began to inflate. Her corset adjusted itself, but could barely keep up. When 
the growth finally finished, her tits stretched in front of her, roughly the size and shape of gallon 
milk jugs, and almost as pale. They were obscenely large on her petite frame, and Mary grunted 
in annoyance and attempted to cross her arms across her chest in displeasure, but found that she 
was no longer able to do so, and would instead settle for folding them in her lap below the table. </p>
<p>Sarah looked across the table at Mary, and saw that her white face and been joined by an 
obscene amount of pale cleavage, and was instantly jealous. But she calmed herself to think that 
the younger girl’s melon shaped breasts would likely sag down past her navel if she ever took off 
that corset, unlike her own heavenly spheres. </p>
<p>Round Six </p>
<p>Sarah’s card showed a young woman climbing out the window of her parent’s house, and </p>
<p>it read The Virgin. </p>
<p>Sarah  felt  an  intense  squeezing  sensation  in  her  groin,  as  her  genitals  grew  somewhat 
smaller  and  neater,  and  her  hymen  reknit  itself.  But  it  didn’t  stop  there,  and  the  tightening 
increased. </p>
<p>Memories of boyfriends, sex, and even her first kiss disappeared from her mind. She was 
now  almost  entirely  asexual.  She  had  no  interest  in  men  whatsoever,  and  though  she  still 
appreciated the beauty of the female form, it was only in the way that an artist appreciates their 
work, nothing more. </p>
<p>Even masturbation was  lost to  her. Her vagina was too  tight for even a single finger to 
penetrate, and the one time that she had tried to experimentally push a pencil eraser up there, her 
attempt  had  been  met  with  intense  pain.  Her  doctor  had  said  it  was  vaginal  contractions,  the 
worst she had ever seen, and she gave Sarah the options for treatment, but the young woman had 
ignored them, having never had an orgasm, she couldn’t see what she was missing. </p>
<p>Mary’s card showed the picture of a young woman handing a knife to an older man and </p>
<p>looking up at him with pleading eyes, it read The Siren. </p>
<p>When nothing happened, Mary asked aloud “What did that do?” but her question was its </p>
<p>own answer; her voice had grown high pitched and taken on a soft and gentle tone. “’Whatever,” 
she muttered, the musical sound barely above a whisper. </p>
<p>Round Seven </p>
<p>In  the  seventh  round,  the  Generosity  card  made  another  appearance,  although  this  time 
the  image  showed  the  same  scene  in  the  morning  light,  the  box  open,  the  crooked  house’s 
occupants horrified by whatever was inside, although it was mercifully hidden from the viewer 
by the angle of the illustration. </p>
<p>“We  know  what  that  means,”  the  dealer  said,  trying  to  feign  enthusiasm as  she  flipped 
another card. It showed an old fashioned Greek vase sitting in a dilapidated temple, with several 
long white feathers resting near its base. It had a long neck and a thick lower potion, and it read 
The Amphora. </p>
<p>Both women immediately felt the flesh of their legs sliding across the leather seats they 
rested on. Their hips were growing significantly wider, Sarah’s narrow hips and Mary’s thicker 
set expanded evenly, until both girls had pelvises that were broader than their shoulders, but that 
was not the end. </p>
<p>Both  girls  felt  themselves  rising  upwards  as  their  butt-cheeks  began  to  inflate  like </p>
<p>balloons, growing significantly larger and rounder. </p>
<p>At  first,  Sarah  was  alarmed  about  what  this  change  would  do  to  her  figure.  Then  she 
realized that  it was the twenty-first  century and that  big  butts  were in.  She  then recalled being 
disappointed  in  her  own  natural  behind,  and  going  in  for  injection  after  injection,  and  wasn’t 
satisfied until her butt was bigger and shapelier than any of the Kardashians. It was a beautiful 
sight to behold, but the huge round behind was obviously fake on the slender white girl, which 
was exactly how Sarah liked it. </p>
<p>Mary’s  butt  was  of  a  more  natural  shape,  but  no  less  big  and  round.  As  the  swelling 
stopped and she felt herself about to panic, the only thought that entered the brunette’s mind was 
relief that she hadn’t worn jeans today. But then, a stranger thought entered her mind, she had the 
distinct memory of putting on pants this morning. She was confused. </p>
<p>As she thought about her pants, her mind began to wonder, to memories of growing up 
and being teased for her bubble butt, even more than her height. When she had hit puberty, she 
had taken on an obscenely pear shaped figure, and it seemed every snack she ate went directly to 
her ass. She had long since given up the idea of ever finding pants that fit, and thought her curvy 
body might look  good now, she was resigned to  the knowledge that she would have the lower 
body of a morbidly obese woman by the time she was in her thirties. </p>
<p>She  breathed  in  slowly,  and  tried  to  wrap  herself  in  her  Gothiness  like  a  shroud.  She 
didn’t care what she looked like, she was smart and artistic. She wasn’t shallow and fake like the 
silicone  swollen  bitch  who  sat  across  from  her.  Mary  smirked  mockingly  at  Sarah,  and  Sarah 
glared back. </p>
<p>Round Eight </p>
<p>This time, Sarah’s card showed an ancient theater mask, long neglected, its once bright </p>
<p>colors faded by the sun. It read The Ivory Mask. </p>
<p>Sarah suddenly felt her face freeze. Her glare grew slack, and transformed into the worst 
case  of  resting  bitch  face  Mary  had  ever  seen.  Sarah  tried  to  move  her  face,  but  found  it 
paralyzed, even blinking was an effort. She ran her fingers over her puffy lips and designer nose, 
and  found  that  everything  was  still  there,  just  frozen.  “Like,  oh  my  god, what  happened?”  she 
managed to squeak, and though she was able to move her lips, her expression never changed. </p>
<p>Mary’s card showed a woman in 1920’s garb seated at a table, cigarette in hand, a strange </p>
<p>smile on her face. An odd bulge under the tablecloth revealed that she was not alone. The card 
read The Poet’s Tongue. </p>
<p>Mary  suddenly  felt  a  tightness  in  her  mouth,  and  had  trouble  breathing,  and  when  she </p>
<p>opened  wide  to  gasp  for  air,  her  tongue  rolled  down  her  chin.  She  mumbled  something,  but 
nobody could make out what it was. </p>
<p>Again,  their  pasts  changed  slowly,  and  their  memories  with  them.  Sarah  reassured </p>
<p>herself, rationalizing that facial paralysis was an expected side effect of Botox. The doctor had 
told her to  wait between injections, but she hadn’t listened. She knew the risks, but if it was a 
choice between expressions and looking young forever, it was an easy choice. Soon, she was as 
impassive on the inside about the whole affair as she was on the outside. </p>
<p>Mary remembered always having an exceptionally long tongue, and doing tricks for her 
friends  in  elementary  school,  licking  the  tip  of  her  nose  or  the  point  of  her  chin,  or  tying  and 
untying knots with her tongue. She had trouble speaking as a kid, but she had mostly gotten it 
under control. She still had a slight lisp, which grew more pronounced when she was excited, but 
with her soft gentle voice most people thought it was terribly cute on the tiny girl. And, like most 
things, people thinking her cute made her even mopeyer. </p>
<p>Round Nine </p>
<p>Sarah’s  ninth  card  showed  a  young  ballerina  pirouetting  on  a  stage  before  a </p>
<p>judgmental audience. The Dancer it read. </p>
<p>Suddenly, there was a loud bang as Sarah’s knees thumped against the underside of the 
table.  She had always been freakishly tall, but proportionately so. Now, her body was shifting, 
her  swanlike  neck  and  lengthy  torso  shrank  slightly,  as  her  legs  began  to  grow  longer  and 
shapelier.  When  it  was  finished,  her  legs  were  over  sixty  percent  of  her  six  feet  five  inches, 
leaving her looking like something out of an anime or an early nineties comic book. </p>
<p>She  felt  her  thighs  press  together  in  her  chair  as  they  took  on  an  even  fuller  and  more </p>
<p>feminine shape, and she felt the heels on her expensive boots grow longer and longer. </p>
<p>Again, her history changed. She remembered insisting on wearing nothing but high heels 
from a very young age; even though everyone tried to tell her that it was a terrible look for such a 
naturally tall girl. But she didn’t care. </p>
<p>As  she  got  older  and  more  practiced  in  heels,  she  found  it  harder  and  harder  to  walk 
without them, and when she had tried to go barefoot the first night after her breast augmentation 
she  had  practically  toppled  over.  Thinking  back  now,  she  realized  she  must  have  chronically 
contracted the tendons in her legs, with a brief and unconnected memory of a college anatomy 
class that flitted into her head and then burst like a deep sea fish rising towards the light.  </p>
<p>Whatever the reason, it was heels for her from then on. The higher the better, and screw 
anyone who judged her for it. She even had high-heeled slippers for going to the bathroom in the 
night. </p>
<p>Mary’s  card  showed  a  man  cruelly  beating  his  prisoner  with  a  bullwhip.  The  victim 
smiled softly through the pain, as if he alone realized who was truly in control here. The Martyr. </p>
<p>Mary  braced  herself  for  another  unwelcome  change,  but  when  none  came  she  asked </p>
<p>“What does that do?” </p>
<p>“You’ll find out when you’re older,” the dealer said as she smiled dismissively. </p>
<p>“Bitsch…” Mary muttered. </p>
<p>Round Ten </p>
<p>Generosity again. This time the owners of the crooked house had wrapped the box back 
up and regifted it to one of their neighbors. The follow-up card once again showed the buxom 
visage of The Matron, and her accompanying brood. </p>
<p>“We already had that one,” Mary pouted. </p>
<p>The dealer shrugged, “It’s a very common card.” </p>
<p>Both  girls  knew  what  was  coming  next.  Mary  looked  down  in  horror  as  her  breasts 
expanded, and cut painfully into the side of the heavy oaken tabletop. She straightened up, and 
readjusted  them  in  her  rapidly  expanding  corset,  so  that  they  rested  atop  the  table.  The  dealer 
quickly grabbed Mary’s cards and moved them to a new position where they were not at risk of 
being  enveloped.  When  the  process  was  finished,  Mary’s  breasts  lay  atop  the  table,  extending 
nearly  two  feet  from  her  torso,  barely  contained  by  her  bustier  and  looking  like  a  pair  of  pale 
watermelons. </p>
<p>Sarah, on the other hand, giggled, and remarked about how totally awesome this was. Her 
breasts swelled like perfect spheres, larger and larger, until they were each bigger than her head, 
easily the size of basketballs, nearly as round, and with just as much bounce. </p>
<p>Sarah loved her perfect boobies. She had been naturally well endowed as a child, but that 
wasn’t  enough  for  her.  She  had  gotten  her  first  pair  of  implants  in  middle  school,  and  had 
steadily upsized every year. She only waited long  enough between surgeries to ensure that she 
wouldn’t have any scarring. </p>
<p>Sarah wasn’t satisfied though, and wouldn’t be until she had the biggest pair in the whole </p>
<p>Mary hated her boobs. They made her look like a freak. The only good thing she could </p>
<p>say about  them was that they took  some attention away from  her butt. She thought they might 
already  be  the  biggest  in  the  world,  at  least  proportionally  if  not  in  absolute  terms,  and  was 
currently  paralyzed  in  dread  at  the  thought  of  getting  undressed  tonight,  when  she  would  feel 
them slap against her thighs and she would see just how far below her crotch they hung when 
unsupported. </p>
<p>world. </p>
<p>Round Eleven </p>
<p>Sarah was smiling on the inside at Mary’s discomfort, and was so eager to proceed that 
she almost drew her own card, but before her long nails could touch the ancient paper the dealer 
smacked  them  away.  Sarah’s  eyes  smoldered  at  the  older  woman,  but  her  face  showed  no 
expression as she patiently waited to be handed her next card. </p>
<p>When it was finally dealt, is showed an inhumanly slender woman, with violet skin and 
long pointed ears, being chased through a rocky wilderness, being careful not to spill a drop from 
the  goblet  of  wine  she  held  close  to  her  small  chest.  The  Maenad  it  said,  although  the  name 
meant  nothing  to  Sarah.  Mary  vaguely  got  the  reference,  and  began  to  imagine  ways  it  might 
mess Sarah up even further. </p>
<p>The only outward change was a slight alteration to the shape of Sarah’s ears as they grew 
slightly longer and more pointed. Nothing quite inhuman or worth more than a second look, but 
Mary thought she looked like she was getting ready to cosplay as Mr. Spock’s slutty sister. Sarah 
didn’t even notice. Instead her mind was preoccupied by a strange tightness in her chest. It felt 
kind of like when she had just upsized her implants, the alien feeling of growth and stretching 
skin, and she poked at her chest tentatively, although aside from some slightly jiggling there was 
no immediate effect. </p>
<p>Mary’s changes were, again immediately apparent. Her card showed a woman in roman 
finery, wearing a white folded toga and with her hair done up in gold and jewels. She was sitting 
alone in front of a great  feast, a table straining under the weight of all the various delicacies it 
held. The woman’s eyes burned with an unnatural lust, and the card read Gluttony. </p>
<p>Mary’s  arms  and  shoulders  immediately  grew  thicker,  the  top  of  her  corset  cutting 
painfully  into  her  pale  flesh.  Her  stomach  began  to  swell,  and  her  corset  tried  to  shift  to 
accommodate it, but  it was already strained far  past  the point  than it had ever been tailored to 
accommodate, and it burst. Mary was pushed away from the table and momentarily  revealed a 
large  and  almost  perfectly  round  pot-belly  before  it  was  covered  by  her  unsupported  breasts, 
breasts which now completely filled her lap and, as they themselves swelled, inched towards her 
knees. </p>
<p>As before, her hips and butt got the worst of it, and even her pale, youthful skin began to 
give way to cellulite as the fleshy spheres of her backside began to fill her chair, threatening to 
leave her stuck in place. The growth stopped with her meaty thighs, leaving them almost as big 
as Sarah’s but without the musculature required to keep their shape. </p>
<p>She figured that in the last thirty seconds she had gained at least twenty five pounds. Not </p>
<p>a huge amount, but on such a tiny young girl it seemed like a ton. </p>
<p>Mary tried to cover her sudden nudity, but there simply wasn’t enough fabric remaining 
in her busted corset and shredded skirt, and every movement sent her whole body to jiggling. She 
lowered her head on the table in defeat, and Sarah felt a brief pang of sympathy for her, before 
stealing herself and forcing her to remember that they were competing, even if she couldn’t quite 
remember how or for what. </p>
<p>When she tried, she suddenly remembered what the sensation in her breasts was. During 
puberty, when most of the other girls were getting their first periods, she had instead begun to 
lactate. But, it wasn’t milk, no. It was something like a potent red wine, intoxicating and almost 
as delicious as it was addictive. She didn’t know how it happened or why, and she didn’t care. 
All she knew is that it made her very popular at parties, and that was what really mattered. </p>
<p>Round Twelve </p>
<p>Sarah’s thoughts were  interrupted by  the dealer placing  the next  card in  front of her.  It 
was an image of a powerful woman standing on an ancient battlefield, wearing nothing save the 
blood of her enemies. It read The Amazon. </p>
<p>Like  Mary  before  her,  Sarah  suddenly  felt  growth  all  over  her  body,  an  uncomfortable 
tightness as  her clothes struggled to  adjust to  her new physique. Unlike  Mary’s transfiguration 
though, Sarah’s new weight came in the form of pure muscle. Her already toned muscles bulged 
outwards,  until  they  were  clearly  visible  at  all  times,  giving  her  the  physique  of  a  practiced 
fitness model. </p>
<p>Her  stomach  grew  flat  and  smooth,  and  her  arms  and  shoulders  took  on  a  broad  and 
ruggedly powerful look, and her already shapely legs bulged with muscle, and her massive thighs 
felt like they could press a thousand pounds, or snap the neck of anyone who dared to put their 
head between them. </p>
<p>The transformation was, all in  all, not  too  extreme compared to  her other changes. She 
had the bulk and definition of someone who spent a few hours in the gym every day, but had just 
enough  padding  on  her  frame  to  ensure  that  she  was  still  sleek  and  feminine,  rather  than  the 
bulging  and  overly  veiny  muscles  that  one  would  see  on  a  competition  bodybuilder  or  steroid 
junky. </p>
<p>Mary didn’t want  to  draw a card. She was trying to  get  her head straight.  It  didn’t feel 
right, none of it. She knew this was wrong. She couldn’t remember ever being anything else, but 
she  knew  that  she  hadn’t  always  been  this  strange  amalgam  of  Wednesday  Addams  and  a 
Paleolithic fertility idol. </p>
<p>But the dealer was insistent. Her voice was equal parts stern and gentle, like the mother </p>
<p>Mary wasn’t sure whether or not she ever had. “It’s almost over.” </p>
<p>Mary  looked  up,  her  dark  green  eyes  swimming  and  threatening  to  burst  into 
tears, and she nodded. The dealer revealed the picture of a large white cow, her udder bulging 
beneath her, her dark and oddly human eyes looking expectantly at the viewer. Io it read. </p>
<p>“Fuck…”  Mary  moaned.  She  knew  what  was  coming  next.  Her  nipples  suddenly  grew 
larger  and  more  sensitive,  and  took  on  a  soft  bubblegum  pink  color  that  made  them  stand  out 
against her pallid skin. Each was now thicker than her thumb and nearly twice as long, looking 
more like obscene cow teats than human nipples. </p>
<p>But, Mary new that it wouldn’t end there, and a moment later there was an uncomfortable 
tightness in her breasts. Milk, of course there was milk. She could barely even reach her nipples 
anymore, how the hell was she supposed to milk herself? </p>
<p>“It could be worse,” the dealer sighed, “you could have gotten her brother Minos.” </p>
<p>Round Thirteen </p>
<p>Sarah was enjoying the look of discomfort on Mary’s face, and watched with pleasure as </p>
<p>she squirmed in her seat. “Like, come on, hit me.” She said. </p>
<p>The dealer obliged, revealing a card which showed a pretty girl sitting with her back to an 
intense  discussion  taking  place  at  some  ancient  Athenian  university,  but  she  merely  smiled 
placidly and played with her long blonde hair while she stared off into space. The Empty Book. </p>
<p>Suddenly, Sarah’s head went funny. She found it hard to pay attention to anything, and 
found herself looking off into space, dreaming of makeup and thinking about what surgery to get 
next.  In an instant, her plans to go to medical school disappeared. She had barely been able to 
pass  high  school,  her  high  marks  in  P.E  barely  buoying  up  her  grades,  and  even  that  would 
probably  have  been  insufficient  without  help  from  her  rich  father  and  the  teachers  who  were 
mesmerized by the girl’s stunning looks and horny boys who were eager to do her homework for 
her. </p>
<p>No, she would be an actress, or maybe a model. Nothing else would do. </p>
<p>Mary smiled as she watched the intelligence drain out of Sarah’s eyes, replaced with the 
vapid look of a stereotypical blonde bimbo right out of a bad eighties sitcom. Mary may be stuck 
in  this  strange  body,  but  at  least  she  was  still  herself.  She  could  still  live  out  her  dreams  of 
directing sexy music videos for up and coming Goth bands. </p>
<p>The  dealer  turned  over  another  card,  which  revealed  a  corpulent  robber  baron  with  his </p>
<p>hand stuck firmly in a jar. It read Greed. </p>
<p>“Oh no,” the dealer said, showing the first genuine concern she had all day. </p>
<p>“What?” Mary asked nervously, trying her best to look cool. </p>
<p>“Well, the Greed card copies your opponent’s most recent change…” </p>
<p>Mary’s  heart  began  to  drop,  just  as  her  breasts  had  when  her  corset  had  given  out </p>
<p>moments before. And then the dealer continued. </p>
<p>“… three times over.” </p>
<p>“No!” Mary wailed petulantly, but it was too late. As before, her reality rewrote itself and 
her memories grew fuzzy, but this time they didn’t refocus. Instead,  Mary was left perpetually 
confused and scared. </p>
<p>What  just  happened?  Who  was  she?  Why  was  she  naked?  What  was  she  doing  in  this 
strange  place?  When  did  she  get  here?  What  were  the  pictures  on  the  table?  Why  did  her  tits 
hurt? Who was the big scary lady sitting across from her, and why was she always glaring? Mary 
did her best to sink back in her chair and hug her breasts to her, hiding her face in her pillowy 
cleavage as she began to cry. </p>
<p>“Sarah, its time for you to draw” the dealer said, trying to get the airheaded valley girl’s </p>
<p>Round Fourteen </p>
<p>attention. </p>
<p>“A card.” </p>
<p>“Draw what?” She said, puzzled. </p>
<p>“Ok, but like, I don’t have a pen,” Sarah intoned patronizingly. </p>
<p>“Just take a card,” the dealer sighed </p>
<p>“Ok, Geeze. Why didn’t you just, like, say so?” </p>
<p>Sarah took the card that the mean old lady offered her and looked at the pretty picture, of 
a seventeenth  century clipper ship  on the high  seas. One sailor looked overboard, panicked by 
something he saw in the water. It read The Sodomites. </p>
<p>Sarah tried several times to read the card, but couldn’t quite manage. Eventually she said </p>
<p>“Soda Might? Is that like, a protein drink or something?” </p>
<p>“Not quite,” the dealer responded. She was actually kind of curious, it was the first time she had 
ever seen that card drawn after The Virgin and she wondered how they would interact. </p>
<p>“Mary?” The dealer said. </p>
<p>“It’s your turn to draw.” </p>
<p>“Take a card.” </p>
<p>“Huh?”  The  young  girl  tentatively  looked  up  from  her  own  milky  cleavage,  tears  streaming 
down her makeup covered face.  </p>
<p>“What?”  Mary  asked  softly.  She  couldn’t  remember  who  the  redheaded  lady  was  or  what  she 
wanted from her. </p>
<p>“Uh….” Mary moaned softly, trying to figure out what was expected of her. </p>
<p>“Here.” The dealer said, forcing a card into her hand. </p>
<p>It showed a woman eagerly biting into a pomegranate, its juices staining her skin red, and 
flowing over her sensuous lips. Mary liked the colors, but couldn’t figure out what was going on 
in the picture, let alone read the words Aphrodite’s Kiss that adorned the bottom. </p>
<p>Mary stared blankly at the card, and then her face began to feel funny. Her lips started to </p>
<p>swell and swell, until they had more than doubled in size. They didn’t stop until they were huge, 
bigger than Angelina Jolie or any other woman in Hollywood, even bigger than Sarah’s collagen 
filled porn-star lips, but they were so shapely and perfect that they were obviously real.  </p>
<p>Her mouth dominated the lower half of her face, like the wax lips you could buy at some </p>
<p>candy stores, and they were every bit as red. </p>
<p>She  ran  her  newly  elongated  tongue  over  them,  and  then  gasped  and  shuddered  in </p>
<p>pleasure. They were so sensitive. </p>
<p>For her part, Sarah sat staring blankly for a moment, before she noticed what a good time 
Mary seemed to be having. She started to feel jealous, and then began to squirm uneasily in her 
seat. She felt, empty, somehow, and oh so horny. </p>
<p>Her  thoughts  drifted  back  a  few  years,  when  she  would  feel  this  way  all  the  time.  She 
couldn’t  masturbate  normally,  her  stupid  ‘giney  was  broken,  so  she  had  to  get  creative.  She 
would sneak phallic objects from around the house, and try  sticking them up her butt. She had 
had  her  first  orgasm  one  night  when,  alone  at  home  and  wound  up,  she  had  taken  one  of  her 
mother’s nice candles off the dinner table and gingerly inserted it all the way into her anus. It had 
been  wonderful,  and  shortly  thereafter  she  had  begun  to  secretly  buy  a  vast  collection  of 
vibrators and butt-plugs of various shapes and sizes. </p>
<p>She glanced longingly at her purse. She knew there was an expensive glass dildo inside, 
one  of  her  favorites.  If  she  had  known  this  game  was  going  to  take  so  long,  she  would  have 
snuck it up her butt before leaving the house this morning so she could bounce on it a bit when 
she started to get bored, like now. But it was too late for that. She didn’t see a bathroom, and she 
didn’t think she  could  do it under the table  without being  noticed, so she just hoped the game 
would be over soon.  </p>
<p>It would be. </p>
<p>Final Round </p>
<p>The dealer was  glad the game was  almost  over.  She felt bad for the both  the girls,  and 
was tired of fighting to get their attention. She caught Sarah’s gaze as the young actress looked 
up from her purse and back to the table, and she drew her final card. </p>
<p>It depicted a pale woman sitting regally on a throne made of ice. The Snow Queen. </p>
<p>“Like Elsa?” Sarah asked. “Yes, like Elsa,” the dealer nodded, though she had no idea what the 
young woman was referring to. </p>
<p>Suddenly, a chill went through Sarah’s body. Her fair skin grew even paler, and became 
perpetually cool to the touch. Her shot glass sized nipples stiffened in the cold, and she doubted 
they would ever thaw. She wished she had brought a coat, but then she realized it would do her 
no good, clothes were just for looks, not for keeping warm. </p>
<p>Mary  took  her  last  card  from  the  strange  lady.  It  showed  the  picture  of  an  exasperated </p>
<p>mother dog, curled protectively around a litter of newborn pups. The Loyal Hound it read. </p>
<p>Mary giggled softly  and smiled “Cute puppy!” She put the card down and immediately </p>
<p>forgot about it. Then, a change washed over her, she felt so vulnerable, and so affectionate. She 
needed to touch someone, and to be touched, right now. She looked up, saw Sarah, and then did 
her best  to  leap from  her chair and launch herself into  Sarah’s lap, fiercely  wrapping  her arms 
around the giant woman and holding on as if for dear life. </p>
<p>Sarah  started  in  alarm,  and  tried  to  push  the  smaller  girl  away,  but  when  she  felt  the 
warmth emanating from her, she softened slightly. She couldn’t remember why she was mad at 
Mary in the first place, and so she stroked the frightened Goth’s hair, and then adjusted her seat 
so that Mary could lay her head between Sarah’s magnificent breasts. A moment later, Mary’s 
head  was  completely  engulfed  by  Sarah’s  cleavage,  protected  from  every  sensation  except  the 
cool touch of her smooth skin and the soothing sound of her heartbeat. </p>
<p>They sat that way for a few moments, before she got bored and looked around. She saw 
the  dealer  staring  at  them  softly,  her  face  a  mixture  or  tenderness  and  pity.  The  deck  was 
nowhere to be seen, and the tabletop was bare. </p>
<p>“Are we, like, done here or something?” Sarah asked. </p>
<p>“I think so.” </p>
<p>“Good.  I  think  I  like,  had  somewhere  to  be?”  Sarah  asked,  trying  to  remember  why  she  came 
here in the first place. </p>
<p>Sarah pushed away from the table and stood to her full height, towering above the other 
two women, the difference made even more extreme by the heels she wore, boots that wouldn’t 
be out of place at an S&amp;M club. </p>
<p>Mary clung to her waist, and upon seeing her, the dealer said “One more thing.” </p>
<p>“Mary, do you know no how to get home?” </p>
<p>The  small  brunette  looked  up  at  her  uncertainly.  She  wasn’t  even  sure  if  Mary  was  her  name. 
After a moment she shook her head, and in her small, soft, gentle voice she said “No.” </p>
<p>“Do you remember where you live?” </p>
<p>“No.” She genuinely didn’t. Her past was all a blur. </p>
<p>“Do you know where your parents are?” </p>
<p>“Do you know who your parents are?” </p>
<p>“Do you know who you are?” </p>
<p>“No.” </p>
<p>“Huh?” </p>
<p>“No…” she squeaked. She couldn’t remember anything before this room, and she began to cry 
again, and she turned her face upwards, pressing it into the side of one of Sarah’s perfect breasts. </p>
<p>“What a ditz,” Sarah said absentmindedly as she stroked the crying girl’s pigtails and then pulled 
out her phone and promptly forgot all about Mary and the fateful game that had made them into 
the women they now were. </p>
<p>“Indeed,” the dealer said, “But I think there’s only one thing we can do about it now.” </p>
<p>Epilogue </p>
<p>Sarah’s career as an actress wasn’t much to speak of; there wasn’t much call for someone 
with her… unusual… physique. Besides, what good was an actress who couldn’t move her face 
and whose ability to  remember her lines was fleeting at  best? Still, she had been in  a few soft 
core fetish movies, as well as playing lesbian vampires or barbarian queens in low budget genre 
flicks  whose  main  selling  points  were  excessive  gore  and  nudity.  Her  agent  told  her  that  she 
might break into the big times if the Red Sonja movie ever got off the ground, but not to hold her 
breath. </p>
<p>Still,  she  loved  the  California  life!  Who  had  time  for  acting  anyway?  Her  days  were 
packed with going to the gym, sunbathing (not that it did any good), endless appointments with 
hair  dressers,  manicurists,  beauticians,  and  cosmetic  surgeons,  and  of  course  lots  and  lots  of 
shopping. Her nights were filled with endless partying at every club in L.A. </p>
<p>She spent money freely, and her credit card bills never seemed to come due. Any worries 
she  might  have,  including  lingering  memories  of  her  previous  life,  quickly  vanished  from  her 
mind, leaving her head blissfully empty once again. She hoped life would stay like this forever, 
and who knew, maybe thanks to the magical tarot deck, it would. </p>
<p>Mary  was  basically  Sarah’s  pet.  She  couldn’t  really  remember  anything  about  her 
previous life, and trying to do so just made her feel even gloomier than usual. She spent her days 
moping around their expensive condo, and waiting for Sarah to get home.  </p>
<p>Sarah had tried to teach her to do housework, but she wasn’t able to remember her tasks, 
heck,  most  days  she  couldn’t  even  remember  how  to  dress  herself,  and  the  large  closet  full  of 
edgy black garments went unused as she spent her days in the nude. </p>
<p>Still, it wasn’t a bad life, and her biggest concern was that Sarah would forget to milk her 
when she got home, which the vapid girl frequently did. And, unless she was having a good day, 
Mary lacked the vocabulary to really express her need to be expressed. </p>
<p>She spent her nights as close to Sarah as possible, taking every opportunity to be close to 
her, even following her  into the shower or the hot  tub  when she would  allow it. They  weren’t 
lovers per se, Sarah had no interest in sex, and Mary no longer had any conception of it. She just 
knew that she loved to be close to Sarah, and that if the tall girl would let her, she would lick and 
kiss her all over. She especially loved liking Sarah’s nipples, she didn’t know why but they made 
her feel good, her thoughts even fuzzier than usual. </p>
<p>Mary’s  favorite  thing  in  the  world  was  when  she  was  bad  and  Sarah  spanked  her 
prodigious bottom, for unbeknownst to either girl that was now the only way Mary could achieve 
orgasm. It was so good that Mary might have been bad on purpose, that is if she was still smart 
enough to connect cause and effect. </p>
<p>And  so  Mary’s  simple  life  was  complete,  and  she  would  end  each  day  snuggled  up 
against Sarah in their shared bed. Sarah, for her part, treated Mary like a living stuffed animal, 
cuddling up against her soft and curvy body for what little warmth it could provide. </p>
<p>And,  as  for  the  mysterious  woman  and  her  deck  of  cards,  well,  they  moved  on  from 
Hollywood, and where they would end up next and whose life they would transform when they 
got there? Well, that’s a tale for another day. </p>
