Chapter 4: Deviation 

Julia didn’t take much notice of the man at first. She did notice 

 there was a man 
that
​

approaching her. But she had fallen into the habit of attending as little as possible beyond that, letting 
the endless stream of men, young and old, dark and light, short and tall, blur together into an indistinct 
succession. Not thinking more than she had to about each individual and just letting things happen 
conserved her energy. 

As she later had ample occasion to note, though, his appearance was memorable, at least 

compared to the men who generally filled

​
sharp jaw-line and almost impish expression made him seem younger at first glance. His auburn hair was 
neatly trimmed but still gave the impression of being fundamental unruliness. He wore a sharp vest and 
sleeves and, after setting down his mug, he always took a moment to roll the sleeves up to his elbows. 
Just now he had actually been circulating the bar for some time, making at least two unhurried 

circuits before coming to rest before Julia. She only really registered him some moment after he had 
begun to touch her when no milking transpired. Instead, he had just places one open hand on each 
breast cupping them gently. That wasn’t what normally happened. Focusing on him for the first time 
their eyes met. The man winked. 

Now his hands did began to move, but not in the way Julia had grown if not accustomed then at 

least resigned to. His fingers moved over her flesh lightly, tracing her thimble-like nipples with gentle 
pressure. Julia trembled involuntarily. For some minutes the man continued his caressing, gradually 
increasing the pressure of his touch. The feeling was electric. Suddenly the pleasurable sensations mixed 
in with the roughness of her daily experience had come to the forefront as pure tactile bliss. She flushed 
as a wave of warmth passed through her body.  

The man evidently sensed her reaction to his striking and began to gently but firmly press his 

thumbs into her soft areolae, mashing round and round. Julia quivered, and suppressed a cry. What was 
he doing? A bit of milk was dripping out over his tireless hands, but it seemed to be incidental rather 
than intentional. 

Julia’s hadn’t felt her breasts to be insensitive before her transformation. But the mounting 
sensation now radiating from the ends of her tremendous udders was entirely outside her previous 
experience. The difference between her prior experience of her bust being stimulated and this was the 
difference between a single roman candle and a full fireworks display. She could feel her arousal steadily 
building as the pleasure shot up her dangling flesh in palpable waves. As what was transpiring dawned 
on her she tried furiously to fight it back, to avoid the fresh humiliation of having her arousal on public 
display. Her awareness of just how exposed she was rose back to the surface of her consciousness from 
where repetition had sunk it, and she felt as if she might lose control. 

 

 

​
​
​
Her back tried to arch, prevented uncomfortably only by the frame that held her in place. With a 

fearsome effort she suppressed another gasp of ecstasy by screwing her eyes shut and biting her lip 
hard. She wanted to twist free of the hands, to yank her chest away, but of course it was impossible. 
Instead of abating, the heat in her body continued to build. And closing off her vision just left her alone 
in the dark with it as the only object of her attention. 

Soon a long, low moan broke through attempts at containment, followed a moment later by 

another. Many nearby faces turned to find the source of the amorous sound, and on top of her pleasure 
was drizzled a burning shame. But she had no time to dwell on it. The man was now gripping her thick 
nipples between thumb and forefinger and rolling them. The sensation was overwhelming. She 
whimpered at her inability to escape, at her seeming helplessness before the magnitude of her own 
responses. Then he began to pinch, to pull hard enough that she should have been wincing in pain. And 
there was pain, but it rode a quivering, pulsing explosion of erotic energy. Julia gasped sharply. For the 
first time her sensation flooded mind registered the thought that she might climax, here, in public, 
mounted on a wall, simply because a stranger was massaging her tits. The possibility had not even 
occurred to her, but she could feel it drawing on, inexorable. She squeezed her legs together and

orgasm, and then it began to recede. Her breasts felt almost chilled at the sudden removal of their 
stimulation. Julia realized she was sweaty, that many eyes were turned to her, that the man in front of 
her was grinning like a fiend. And, humiliatingly, she realized that in the dark behind the wall her panties 
were dripping wet. The man wiped his white smeared hands on a towel laid in readiness, picked up his 
largely empty glass, and turned on his heel walking out of sight. Julia was left with her unwanted, 
achingly unfulfilled arousal, and her shame. She shut her eyes and kicked her unseen legs in frustration. 
From that day on, she was paid a visit by the man once every cycle. He seemed to have 
appointed himself her personal tormentor. And though his visits differed in their particulars each ended 
in the same way: with Julia, her defenses broken down, trembling on the brink of an orgasm that never 
came.

“It’s a bad idea. Escape is always a bad idea!” Jacky, was remonstrating with a circle of women 
bunched together in one corner of the dining hall and trying her best to keep from raising her voice too 
much. 

“Escape isn’t a bad idea,” a tall blonde with at least ten facial piercings replied with energy. 

“Getting caught is a bad idea. Escaping, getting out, is a fucking great idea.” 

“And nobody ever does get out,” Jacky rejoined with vehemence. “Every escape sounds good, 

and every one ends the same way! It doesn’t sound so good when they drag you back to processing and 
think of something really creative to do with you so nobody else will try it!” 

“We don’t know if

with the blonde. 

Jacky didn’t let her get further, “I’ve seen it. I’ve been here and I’ve seen it.” She gestured to a 

woman towards the back of the circle, “Stormy, you were here the last time. You remember Willow. Tell 
them about Willow.” 

Stormy didn’t seem anxious to speak, but when all eyes turned to her she gave in. Nervously 
playing with one of her thick, thigh-length pigtails she offered, “They’d done something to her feet, 

 

 

​
Willow’s feet. She and some others had tried to run from the guards, push one over and then just run 
for it. So they made her feet really, really sensitive. She couldn’t run after that.” 

“She could barely walk.” Jacked barked. “She said that it was like walking on her clit. Remember 

how she’d crawl, Stormy.” 

The dark haired woman nodded and frowned at the memory. “She used to get on all fours even 

in the shower sometimes,” she agreed quietly. 

 There was a murmur around the circle. The blonde woman spoke up again. “Ok, so you’ve seen 

it go badly. Of course it can! But just being here goes badly.” For jarring emphasis she lifted her bra 
revealing her triply pierced nipples. “That doesn’t seem like a reason to stay for more. It doesn’t mean it 
can’t go right. And besides, this time it’s different. We’ll have help.” 

“Get out? Get out where?” Jacky demanded in frustration. “What is outside?” How did they not 

get this? Trying to escape was just walking up to a tender and saying “Please keep me here longer and 
while you’re at it find something more awful for me to do.” The people who ran the place held all the 
cards. And she didn’t for a moment believe the new story about friends in high places. But some seemed 
to be nodding with the blonde and her friend who had reported the bullshit story. 

Apparently the friend had heard that somebody, somebody with power, secretly wanted to see 
the women liberated. This person, whoever it might be, was in the City’s command, and she had friends 
everywhere. They were spreading the word that if you did try to escape and got into the tunnels, there 
was a way to call help to your location. The others had made the women repeat her story four times 
consecutively. There was always an escape plan bubbling somewhere, and this tidbit had brought one 
masterminded by the blonde to full boil. 

“But how can you know it’s true?” Jacky had demanded.  
The answer was that the information had come from the guards themselves. Several women 
had managed to listen to a pair of tenders who didn’t realize they were being overheard. They’d been 
complaining that something had gone wrong, that women were going to escape this time for sure. The 
woman stole a chance later on to compare notes in hushed tones, and their recollections agreed in all 
the major points. Jacky didn’t buy it. 

“Look,” the blonde was speaking again, “we are being held here against our will, abused, and 
you’re saying we should just sit here and let them do it? We should try to escape anyway! We should 
riot! We should bite! But now with this,” she gestured at her friend, “we have something to go on. I’m 
not going to ignore that.” 

Jacky shook her head. “I just don’t want to see what happens to you and whoever drag with you. 
I don’t want that. This is some dumb rumor—too good to be true. I’ve seen false rumors before too. We 
all have. But I can’t stop you.” Jacky got up to walk away. 

“You’ve been doing what they say too long.” The blonde growled as a parting shot at her retiring 

opponent. 

“Too damn long,” Jacky murmured, too quietly to be heard. “Too damn long

Torch’s nipples hurt. If most women were to suddenly feel that sensation in their breast they 
would shriek and flail; but Torch had been given many chances to learn to cope. The source was two 
theatrically long clips that pitilessly gripped her nipples, evil cousins to the clothespin. She ignored them. 
She was in the midst of a match and her mind was focused tightly on other things. 

 

 

This game was an eight woman free-for-all: the contestant with the most points wins. Shafts 
would burst out of apertures around the geometric terrain of the arena and points were awarded for 
delivering them to one’s own receptacle in the middle. But the contestants’ arms were wrapped tightly 
with their elbows bent and hands at shoulders. This rendered the limbs little chicken wings useless for 
object manipulation though still of some utility for balance. The shafts, milky double-ended dildos a bit 
over a foot long, had to be transmitted orally. Specifically, in fact, they had to be transported by oral 
suction. Any contact of teeth with the unblemished surface of a shaft would subtract from the biter’s 
points as well as delivering a shock to the over-eager girl. Stealing was encouraged, however, and the 
puckered standoffs that sometimes ensued might see contestants nearly kissing as they attempted to 
rest their prize from each other’s lips.

could then place bets on the outcome and, having wagered, watch the action unfold from the stands as

She had played basketball and later rugby in life outside the City and had a penchant for the tactics of 
athletic games. But she was also, in contrast to many others, able to tune out a lot of the trappings of 
the lewd games she now played: the tight latex, the clips and clamps, the fact that she was currently 
running about half naked a dildo in her mouth and a crowd of cheering men watching her from the 
stands. It all faded to a dull murmur—it was like playing on a hurt knee. This meant that in the little

ecosystem of women stuck in the 
​
desirable games, one’s in which the mix tipped towards athleticism and away from fetishistic 
degradation. “Slurping” was one such. 

Today, though, Torch’s focus was uncharacteristically divided. She was distracted by one 
particular man sitting in the stands. This dumpy little git had been betting on her all morning. She knew 
this because in her last lineup he’d leaned in and told her so. He’d also told her a fair few other things. 
Things he’d like to do to her. Things he’d like her to do to him. How he’d bet a tidy sum on her and 
would think of her securing him his payout as her doing those things to him in spirit. 

Torch had a bit in her mouth at the time, and probably would have had the sense not to say 

anything anyway. Guys like that shouldn’t get under her skin—guys in the 
say, yell, cheer, and even sing indecent things. But his florid anatomical creativity and total smugness 
had goaded her badly. There he sat now, small but discernible in the stands sipping a drink and cheering 
every time she slotted another phallus into her goal. The little sack of shit.

The game clock showed this match to be near its end. “Ms. Torch” and “Lady Midnight” as the 

announcer called them were “neck and neck for first place” far beyond the reach of the other 
contestants who were by now contemplating the results of defeat (the 
’s designers were

creative about that too). Torch’s eyes darted here and there, her ears alert for the sound of a last 
deciding shaft being extended. When it did emerge both women were nearby, but Torch managed to 
scoop it up and then turned in a mad dash for the center that Midnight was too tired to overtake. 

At the last second before her goal she drew up and stood erect. She stared into the stands and 

locked eyes with that odious little turd before audibly spitting the thing from her. A second later a 
panting Midnight pounced on it as Torch still didn’t move.

The man gaped. Even the unflappable announcer missed a beat before saying, “Well, well, well, 

we seem to have a contestant who didn’t want to win after all—a woman who’d rather be on the 
bottom.” Torch smirked as the endgame buzzer signaled her defeat.

Despite what looking at her might have inclined you to believe, Jigglibits was not mentally 

enfeebled. It was hard for many to see her wobbling breasts, her face seemingly replaced by platinum 
fluff, her teetering gate, and not conclude that her mind in some way mirrored the grotesquery of her 
body. But the truth was that her mind was substantially unaltered. It was just now perched within this 
crude caricature of a teenage wet dream.  

Even Captain Dirn seemed to have slipped into this a bit. “Jiggli” had been his personal plaything 

and prop for quite some time. She’d mutely endured countless indignities and violations, and the 
presence of her form had gradually ceased to fully register as the presence of an active mind. 
Case-in-point, presently he was in the midst of an earnest talk with some of his wraiths. Prudence would 
dictate careful attention to who heard what was said. Yet Jiggli stood in quietly in one corner of the 
room, for the moment unheeded. 

She was methodically gyrating her massive rump as Dirn had instructed. Even this motion was 

rendered arduous by her dimensions and the difficulty of balancing her mass. And, true to her name, the 
movement did engender a lot of jiggling in her monstrous ass as well as elsewhere. The twitches and 
tremors of her body were a constant source of distracting sensations. Her arms were presently locked 
uncomfortably behind her head—they were always locked somewhere--so that the view was 
unobstructed. She panted softly. 

To say she wasn’t enfeebled was not to say they’d left no imprint. She’d been tweaked in many 

subtle and demeaning ways. For example, she was now aroused by male voices—especially ones 
speaking harshly. Thus being kept in Dirn’s office ensured that she would be uncomfortably hot and 
bothered for long periods. But none of this stopped her overhearing everything that was said. 

The wraiths were a sort of secret police force. A small subdivision within the tenders, they were 
responsible for investigating anomalies, breaches, and problems. They had an eerie reputation to match 
their eerie name, aided by the fact that they also dealt with internal affairs. If women ever did somehow 
slip out of the carefully oiled machine that kept the city running then the wraiths would descend. She 
had herself been cornered by the wraiths once, just before the end of the incident that had gotten her 
this form. Though it was an old humiliation, being aroused by their talk stung even now. 

But there were no fugitives to catch or unruly citizens to daunt today. Something else was afoot. 
“Are you any closer to the source of the messages?” Dirn had just been asking. 
“No, sir. I don’t think we are.” Sillin, a veteran wraith, growled. “We’re listening. But we have 

very little to go on yet. It seems that the same messages had five different simultaneous points of origin. 
In each case, one guest is supposed to have heard it from another, or from one of the tenders. But we’re 
having trouble finding out just who. We interrogated three, and nothing useful came out of it. And the 
points of origin are spread out, which just confirms that somebody started this deliberately.” Within her 
stifling blonde prison Jiggli’s ears perked up. 

“I know I don’t need to tell you what a high priority this is.” Dirn responded. “And I likewise 

don’t need to tell you to apply all your resources to it. But it is, and you should. I’ve been in conversation 
with the archons, though even there we’re trying to be judicious.” 

“We’re everywhere. We’ll figure it out. But it may take time.” 

 

 

Dirn scowled. “I know. But if we’re right that there is a traitor behind this it’s a huge 
liability—we can’t be sure just how large the threat posed is until we catch the source. If you think of 
something, even something drastic, that could speed things up, bring it to me.” Sillin touched his 
forehead in recognition. 

“In the meantime,” the other wraith now spoke, his voice was much higher than his fellow’s, 
almost nasal, “we’re doing damage control, trying to ensure that no serious disruptions result in the 
short term. We’ve engineered a rumor to try and corrupt the word of mouth transmission of the original 
messages.” 

“What sort of rumor?” 
“It agrees with the message in part: somebody wants to help, they have many friends. But it 

inserts a specific element in the narrative--a specific way to call for the help of these friends.” 

“What’s the utility of that?” 
“Two things. One. The action that’s supposed to call for help sets up a beacon we can track. If 
anybody was to end up outside of containment motivated by the rumor they’ll call wraiths directly to 
their locations.” 

“So you’re actually making this work for you?” Dirn chuckled grimly, “That’s my favorite thing 

you’ve told me today.” 

“We do what we can.” The wraith’s lip turned up at the corner, an incomplete smile. “Two, if a 

group or two get caught trying it we’re hoping it will discredit the rest of the message, at least for a 
while.” 

Dirn nodded. It was a pleasure to deal with competent people. He had been military almost all 
his life and, in his estimation, the City was more likely than any waking world posting he’d ever had to 
put the right people in charge. “Can there be any credibility to the claim of many friends?” 

Sillin shrugged. “I’d guess no. Our people might not follow every regulation, and some are 

dumb, but they’re not looking to undermine the City. They want what the city gives them.” 

“That was my thought too. This place is a dream come true for most of our guys.” 
“Still,” it was the high pitched voice again, “only a fool bets too much on human rationality. 

We’re going to proceed as if anything might be true.” 

“Well, report to me if you find anything. Good hunting.” 
With a silent salute--two fingers pressed to the temple--the wraiths departed Dirn’s office. He 

sat for some minutes deep in thought. His knuckles intermittently drummed on his desk. Finally, finding 
that he had mentally traced the same fruitless chain of thought he’d been pursuing all morning, he 
cleared his head with a cough. 

“Come here, Jiggli,” he barked, “bend over the desk.”  
Jigglibits carefully turned and began blindly waddling towards the voice, feeling for the hard 

edge of the desktop with the distant contours of her bosom. She’d caught the irritation in his voice, and 
knew where it would shortly be directed, but her mind was racing at what she’d just overheard.

idea what that was so maybe it was Torch’s way of telling her to shut up. But a moment later Torch 
continued, “It’s like a demon Sybian screwed a mechanical bull. They strap me to the thing and some 
guy controls it and tries to beat everyone else controlling one.” 

“He’s trying to throw you off?” 
“No.” Torch replied peevishly. “I said I was strapped on didn’t I? The game is to see who can 

make the rider cum the most times. ‘Rough ride’ see? They control all the bucking and pulling and 
vibrating like an arcade game.” As she spoke she gestured to different places on her body that would be

“Sounds lovely,” Jacky offered archly. 
“That shithead deserved it. And you can fuck right off.” Torch grumbled. They ate in silence for a 

few minutes before torch stood and walked towards the bunk room. 

Julia had been having an unexpected and rather uncomfortable reaction to the whole 
conversation. She finally made up her mind to mention it to Jacky. “Jacky, I’ve been having a problem.” 

“Yeah? What kind of thing?” 
“Well, I’ve started to feel really

“It didn’t work?” 
Julia nodded, surprised. 
 “Yeah, a lot of the women here can’t grind one out. I think it’s something they do to us—like 
they changed something so we can’t orgasm unless somebody else is involved.” That made sense. Her 
attempts to touch herself had mostly just felt like being prodded, as if the hand touching her hand 
belonged to her gynecologist rather than herself. 

Julia furrowed her brow. Since the man in the vest had begun visiting her the tension had grown 
extreme, beyond anything she was used to. To her dismay, envisioning the rough treatment Torch would 
shortly endure had actually gotten her rather excited.  

Jacky looked sympathetic. “We can’t really do anything about that, but, if you want, I can find 

somebody to help you with the problem.” 
“You mean like in here?” 
“Yeah.” 
“I’ve never been with a woman.” Julia bit her lip.

Julia was too preoccupied to give this joke more than a wan smile.

Collin, it seemed, might not to be Collin much longer. He had passed through the first three 

stages of screening almost as smoothly as he’d solved the recruiting puzzle. He had only a hazy notion of 
what was being offered him, but between a sense that it was significant and a sly pride in his own 
abilities he’d brought a certain energy into everything they’d thrown at him. He’d been deeply 
psychologically probed both verbally and by more direct means. He had also been subjected to a more 
intense battery of tests, including one which had to be completed while a pair of curvy women in 
schoolgirl uniforms, a special fancy of his as the psychological probes had revealed, fawned over him. 
He was now in the fourth and final stage, the one in which what was being offered was finally 

laid bare. This discussion took place in a cube imbued with the strongest memory locks craft had yet 
produced. Immediately upon withdrawing beyond its walls whatever had transpired inside would vanish 
into void. All that would remain was a positive or negative result transmitted out via the push of a 
button. Collin sat at a little round table across from three other men who had just laid things out for 
him.  

“So I’d change my name? What’s the purpose o’ that then?” 
“You’d take a name for use here. We have each done the same. I was born ‘Jonathan’ but here I 

am Carv.” 

“I’m Xiv in place of ‘Abdulla.’” 
“And I wake up as ‘Chad’ but here I’m Lum.” 
“Funny little names, aren’t they? Do I have to take a short little snippet like that?” 
“Short names are the tradition. You would be expected to follow it.” 
“Huh. Alright then, Mr. Tits it is.” He grinned. His breezy attitude was, apparently, un-dulled 

even in the face of esoteric secrets being revealed. But his deeply furrowed brow also signaled a less glib 
response to the whole thing. Collin earnestly considering and, though he didn’t know it, this fact too was 
part of the evaluation. 

When he finally spoke again, it was with more reservation, “Look, only a right moran would pass 

this by. This is an amazing thing--even without the fine girls it’s
well it’s hard to swallow. But, you all 
seem very serious, very proper. You’ll have noticed I like to take the piss. What happens if I take your 
offer and then can’t be quite proper all the time?” 

…

Xiv smiled, “I expect there will be some adjustment. And you may well talk your way into 
unpleasant duty if you don’t learn to keep some things to yourself. In fact, I would bet that you do. But I 
suspect you’ll find the incentives can curb your tongue when it is needed. At any rate, we would not 
extend the offer if we were not confident you’d be an asset—irreverent wit and all. And I think we are 
all now fully satisfied of that,” his colleagues nodded. 

There was another long pause. Then Collin smiled. “I’m in. When do I get my hands on some of 

them fine girls?”

The 

 drew crowds to watch many games besides slurping (more officially Rod Burying, 
Crucible
​
but that name wasn’t used many places other than signage). At any given time multiple simultaneous 
competitions were running in separate arenas. And Torch would have been profoundly relieved to see 
her name listed as a competitor in any of them other than the Rough Ride. Literally any of them: chains, 
oil, contortion, weights, blindfolds, bars, and electricity notwithstanding. Her bravado of the cycle prior 
had been just that, empty bravado, and now she was facing the upshot of her actions with dread. 

Torch’s first stop, as ever, was her “changing room,” a dim, closet-sized space in which she was 

locked. Her outfit and gear would be shoved in through a hatch in the door and she’d be left there to 
struggle into the day’s pinching, binding attire. Today her costume would be simple though: a crotchless 
panty made of snug red latex and a corset of the same shade. She was left in the muggy little space to 
contemplate her fate. 

Eventually the door swung open again and she was lead out. A device like a catch pole, standard 

equipment for the staff of the 
, was slipped over her head and she was pushed down to the 
Crucible
​
lower level to be lined up on a rack for her upcoming match. The Rough Ride was one of only a few 
games that allowed patrons to directly involve themselves in the spectacle. (There were other places for 
that sort of thing.) Participation in these cost a good bit of coin and was thus largely reserved to those 
who’d won bets on other events, a kind of special prize for the dedicated patron.  Thus there were 
fewer men walking around the line of naked women than she was accustomed to. But the men who 
were present were very attentive, subjecting the women to scrutiny from every angle. Being displayed 
like a piece of meat had been a routine part of her existence for some time but, as her recent actions 
dramatically emphasized, never something that entirely stopped feeling like an indignity. One fellow 
spent a long time simply staring at Torch’s exposed genitalia as if trying to work something out.

When the time came for the match to actually begin the women were individually hoisted into 

the “rough rider.” Meanwhile the men hoping to pilot them to victory were lead through a brief draft to 
pick their horses. Torch’s description of the cruel device had been fairly apt. A crescent shaped frame 
was held aloft by turret that could pivot it in multiple directions. To this frame each woman was securely 
bound: first the corset was latched in and pulled tight, then arms in front and legs behind were strapped 
down in a position as if she were on all fours. Thus immobilized she could only feel the apparatus closing 
in around her. Something large and round poked at the entrance of each woman’s most private opening. 
Flanged cups connected to the frame by tubes were adhered to breasts, buttocks, hips, and thighs. 
Finally a sort of mouth-piece was installed, a ring which slipped behind her lips and clamped down on 
them from the front while leaving an open circle of space between. A staffer circled the ring of women 
with a sprayer connected to a canister on his back. He gave a brief squirt into the mouth of each woman 
through the open mouthpiece. The stuff was sickly sweet and viscous. Eyes wide, breathless, trembling, 
her mouth sticky with disgusting sweetness, Torch waited. 

The installed women stood within a short barrier, a display hovering above each. In a moment 
men began to take their places along the barrier. A barrel chested man with a wooly neck beard stood 
before Torch and placed his hands on the control yolk corresponding to her machine in a state of 
readiness. The voice of the omnipresent announcer (did this same individual announce all events 
simultaneously?) came from somewhere overhead, “Gentlemen, please take your controls. Begin driving 
her wild in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.” And with that, it began. 

1 The coin system employed in the open sectors might seem an oddly artificial device. But, if you consider, it makes 
sense that adding monetary concepts would help to generate and focus desire. Consider the electric effect of the 
phrase “thousand dollar an hour escort.” The coins also served more mundane regulatory functions, such as 
providing an easy device to limit load on the system. 

​
​
The beast came to life slowly. Something large began shoving itself between her lower lips, the 

entire stand gently rose and pitched backwards, and the various clinging pads began to quiver 
innocuously. Only slowly did it begin to reveal its terrible might to those held in its embrace. But nobody 
was fooled. They all had at least some inkling of what was coming. 

Now, an unsophisticated (or frustrated) operator might simply crank all the systems “all the way 

up” resulting in a bruisingly rough session for his unlucky rider. But, while it might offer some fun, this 
was not the approach of a skilled competitor. One had to find the rhythm of his rider and utilize it—not, 
of course, the rhythm she would have wanted from a lover, but the more primal rhythm that would ring 
every last drop of passion from her lusty, pleading form. He was helped in this by the obscene sounds 
leaking from her unsealable mouth and by a bar appearing just above his score on the display overhead 
which revealed raw arousal. 

For Torch, the almost gentle beginning of her session was short lived. First, her controller began 
firing up one bank of stimulators and then another. There were several dimensions of control over these 
undulating pads: intensity, frequency, pulse pattern—as well as a button to deliver a temporary burst of 
intensity. Soon the sensitive flesh of her body buzzed with an inescapable rhythm of shivering force. 
Next, the thrusting into her pussy began to intensify. Both depth and frequency were dialed up, until her 
body jerked just slightly with each forceful thrust. A groan escaped Torch’s un-closable mouth. The 
pounding invader was self-lubricating, but still snug in its tender sheath. 

Neck-beard glanced at the display. He was satisfied with what he saw. To her dismay Torch 

concurred. The stimulation was drawing a response from her body which she had not anticipated, no 
doubt partly because of whatever she’d been dosed with. Intellectually, she did not find anything about 
this erotic, but her body seemed to have other ideas. Soon her groans of discomfort were becoming 
hard to distinguish from moans. All around her she could hear the audible evidence of seven other 
women’s mixed distress and arousal. 

As the red line above her zero extended, Neck-beard changed his tactics. Suddenly Torch’s body 

began to buck energetically, rising and falling with a timing that resonated with her thudding 
penetration. At the same moment there was a burst of excitement in her breasts, the apparatus 
mounted there being so activated that the organs visibly jiggled. She screeched inchoately in panicked 
objection, but even as she flopped this way and that in the grip of her mechanical ravisher she could still 
feel the first internal quiver of what was coming. 

“And little Ms. Torch takes the first point of the match!” boomed the announcer’s voice. “What 
an eager little slut!” Various onlookers cheered, though not Neckbeard—he was just getting underway. 
Torch gasped and writhed red faced in the throes of an intense orgasm, but there was no relief. 
The stimulation from all quarters only kept coming, and the reprieve in her loins was fleeting. She’d fully 
intended, even as the machine started up, to fight every step of the way and drag any man fool enough 
to control her machine down to defeat. But the assault of movement and sensation made even 
formulating complex intentions a herculean feat. It was like being rubbed all over, tossed like a ragdoll, 
and tirelessly fucked all at once in public. 

By the ending buzzer on the first game, Torch had scored eight points for her pilot and wailed 
herself hoarse. A sticky mix of her own juices and the lubricant ejected by the machine ran down her 
inner thighs. Her sweat-drenched head was muddled, her vision blurred, and she staggered as much 
from lack of equilibrium as from the shakiness in her limbs as the staffer lifted her off the Rough Rider. 
The unprecedented succession of climaxes she’d undergone had felt as if it wouldn’t end, like her body 
would just keep spasming in unbearable, unwanted climax perpetually. Neckbeard hadn’t 
won--somebody else had beaten him by three points. She couldn’t imagine enduring another match. 

 

 

 

 

 

“Don’t worry,” said the staffer in a gentle tone that bellied his true intentions, “you only have 8 

more matches today. And we’ll spray you down between them.”

Just to be within the Shaperate Academy was a pleasure to a person of aesthetic sensibility, and 

doubly so for Shaper Eld who could appreciate the craft in much of what he saw. The Academy was a 
strikingly beautiful structure on gothic-inspired lines—its size and shape a tribute to the grand vision of 
the city’s founders.  The main concourse, in which Eld now strolled, reflected this exterior, all graceful 
white lines and restrained tracery with light streaming in on all sides. He took time, as he always did, to 
gaze at the lithesome, jewel-tone occupants of the enormous mermaid tank, and to admire the statues 
2
of the five goddesses on their high pillars.   

This, he felt, was just what he’d needed today. It would be too strong to say Eld hated the jobs 

he’d recently been assigned, but they took any zest out of his work. His day in processing had ended 
with a succession of women all bound for the same destination, all to be resculpted to the same specs. 
They were to be given a kind of severe, angular appearance. In service of this he was to smooth out their 
chests, removing almost any hint of contour, while widening their shoulders. Others had already 
adjusted jaw-line and eyes. The result was very man-ish. And while he assumed this look must make 
somebody somewhere burn with libidinous frenzy—why else would he be doing it? —it was draining to 
spend so much care and effort on what felt, to him, like the eradication of nubile beauty. He’d actually 
stopped to fondle the fourth woman’s chest for a moment simply because he felt her pert little breasts 
should be appreciated before going entirely to waste. 

Eld had friends all over the city, the fruit of a long career and affable personality. Of late he’d 

struck up a friendship with Mond, a high shaper. Mond was both subtle and creative, and had risen 
easily through the Shaperate hierarchy. Eld was frankly envious of the resources at Mond’s disposal and 
his freedom to pursue ideas, but there was no hint of resentment in this. He enjoyed Mond’s company 
and had to admit besides that the gleam in the younger man’s eye signified a rapidity of thought he 
could not match. 

It was in response to an invitation to visit Mond’s lab that Eld now strolled the academy halls. He 

turned from the main concourse into one of its tributaries, and then turned again winding his way into 
the more utilitarian interior spaces. He was twice stopped and asked for credentials, but flashing his 
invitation with the appropriate seals saw him ushered through. 

A spacious suite of dark grey rooms with curving walls and shimmering lights reminiscent of a 

grotto was Mond’s workspace. Here and there the floor opened onto containment wells. Several ornate 
forges stood ready for use. It was a long way from the antiseptic white of processing. At this hour Eld 
and the high shaper largely had the space to themselves. They chatted amiably as the Mond showed off 
his lab’s various projects. 

 They were not as alone as they seemed, however. A woman watched the two men from inside 
her storage cabinet. She was one of several all-purpose test subjects kept in the lab for convenience and 
drawn from a pool maintained by the Academy.   Her official catalog number was 7481, as could be read 
in clear lettering on her forehead, inside her lip, and on the bottom of her right foot, but staff had 
nicknamed her “Pointy.” (The two others in cabinets next to her own were “Pinky” and “Puffy.”) 

2 The cult of the five goddesses was not religious, at least in any robust sense of the word—nobody in the academy 
believed in the divinities. They were personified ideals, akin to lady liberty or lady justice, embodied symbols of 
abstracta.  

 

 

 
 
 
 

It was not supposed to be possible for stowed women to be conscious in their cabinets. A 
localized version of the field used on bunk rooms ensured that test women were only conscious when in 
use. But it seemed some of the mental tampering done to 7481 had, as an accidental side effect, 
partially inured her to the device. Of late she would wake up for periods even with the cabinet door 
closed. She was unable to escape the coffin-like chamber and sound barely penetrated. But she endured 
the claustrophobic confinement instead of drawing attention to her abnormality and risking its removal. 
Perhaps it would afford her an opening she told herself, but it also afforded her some shred of agency, 
which for her was in very short supply.  

“Pointy” had been sentenced to a surreal existence when she’d been assigned to the Academy’s 

labs. She would wake to be thrust into some bizarre experiment without explanation. Often, she was 
inexplicably modified and tweaked, never knowing what condition she might be in when she next 
awoke. One lab strapped a tube into her mouth and forced her to gulp tasteless goo at an alarming rate 
her belly sloshing with an uncomfortable weight. Then it had been a different set of strange faces, a 
different room, rubbing lipstick on her which caused her mouth to swell shut. Her life was a string of 
these bizarre flashes.  

She’d spent eerie hours gazing at her body from the outside as she’d been made to fumble 

through simple tasks. Yet another group had used her for gravity related work giving parts of her body 
their gravitational orientation. For some time her breasts, hair, and arms each pulled “down” in a 
different direction, standing straight out from her torso. Every change was supposed to be scrubbed 
when she was put back into general circulation, but often traces remained. The tips of her breasts still 
didn’t quite submit to gravity which was the source of her current nickname. The combined effect was a 
profound helplessness. 

Here in Mond’s lab her experience had been mild by comparison, though still deeply peculiar. 

She’d be hauled out of storage, handed balls, and ordered to juggle. She’d been a librarian before being 
a lab rat, and she had no idea how to do it. So she’d simply tossed balls up haphazard seldom catching 
them again. But, at a certain point, an odd thing happened: her movements started to coordinate 
themselves. Recently, to her bewilderment, she’d found herself doing something very like juggling. She 
didn’t know how but it was happening. 

Mond was presently explaining this very process to Eld, and 7481 strained to hear his words. His 

lab was working on complex action templating, directly implanting complex behavior patterns into 
subjects. Simple behaviors were already possible and were routinely used in processing. Women could 
be made to walk with an exaggerated hip-swinging gate, to roll their Rs, to cup their breasts as a nervous 
habit, or to suck properly, all without meaning to. But more complex and purposeful behaviors had 
proven difficult. 

Their conversation was interrupted by an ominous tone from Eld’s pad. Quickly scanning the 

device Eld announced in a vexed tone “I’m sorry, I have to get back to main processing.”  In response to 
Mond’s raised eyebrows he added, “It seems there was some sort of escape attempt—a large one. I’m 
being called in to help with reprocessing.”

3 One might suspect that the pads had been designed partly in mimicry of real world phone technology. Though, on 
the other hand, one might suspect that some of those behind the design of contemporary smart phones had used 
the City’s pads.
