Paid in Full, Part I


 


by: Kodos


����������� 


I was sitting on the couch
watching the TV when Joanna walked through the front door.


 


����������� �Welcome
home, hon,� I said brightly, which wasn't hard to do, as the sight of my
girlfriend all dressed up for business in a nice skirt and jacket was as
pleasing as it was rare, �How did the interview go?�


 


����������� �Ah, it
went,� she said with a dismissive shrug as she straggled over and sank into the
couch next to me, �I'm pretty sure I won't be getting a call back from them
anytime soon.�


 


����������� �That bad,
huh?� I asked, desperately trying to think of a way to lift her spirits and
failing miserably, �You didn't accidentally make fun of the HR manager's
haircut again, did you?�


 


����������� �What,
no!� Why do you always bring that one
time up?� Joanna sighed, her expression softening a little as she looked at me,
�No, it wasn't any one thing, it was just, you know, sometime you get the
feeling that you're just not a good fit before you even get called in from the
waiting room?� It was that kind of thing.�


 


����������� �Well,
maybe you're just being too hard on yourself then and they're calling your
references right this very moment,� I offered, �And if it really was that bad,
then it's probably for the best and your talents would be wasted on a bunch of
straitlaced clock-punchers like them anyways.�


 


����������� �I know-
it's just been three months since I got laid off and I'm starting to feel like
maybe I'm doing this all wrong,� Joanna confessed, grabbing the half-finished
beer from my hand and finishing it in one long, weary gulp, �I mean, should I
start trying to stand out a little bit less on these things?� You know, leave my nose ring at home and dye
my hair a slightly less flaming shade of red?�
It's not like anyone else believes it's naturally this color anyway.�


 


����������� �Never!� I
shot back, as I walked into the kitchen to get a fresh drink for each of us and
try to think of something, �I mean, you wouldn't be happy somewhere that you
couldn't even wear your hair natural, and if you didn't like working some
boring place like that, it wouldn't work out anyway.� You're just saving yourself all that drama by
being up front with people.�


 


����������� �Mmph,
honest or not, if we don't start bringing in more money soon, we're not going
to be able to make the rent, and don't you even think about getting a second
job; you've already got school and work to worry about,� Joanna insisted,
opening the proffered can and taking long pull, �Anyways, enough about me
failing at jobs, what's the latest in the wide world of weird?�


 


����������� �Ah, I
thought you'd never ask,� I said, grateful for a chance to change the subject,
�Some guy who owned a candy store in Hoboken just said that one of the
strangers showed up at his door and offered him, and I am not exaggerating
here, twenty million bucks for the whole place and every last gummy bear and
bonbon he had in stock.�


 


����������� �Damn, that*is* weird,� Joanna said, �What did he do?�


 


����������� �Well he
took the money, of course,� I explained, �I mean, the guy said his shop wasn't
worth a tenth of that, so how could he pass up that kind of payday, and
besides, you know, there's the whole thing with the government getting involved
when people don't let them have their way.�


 


����������� �Jeez, this
is like an episode of the Twilight Zone or something,� Joanna said, unbuttoning
her jacket and reaching for an open bag of chips, �I almost wish the President
would go on the air and announce that we were being invaded or had joined the
United Federation of Planets or it was all because of brain slugs or something,
because none of this makes sense right now.�


 


����������� �Like,
where did they even come from?� I kind of
always expected a flying saucer landing right in front of the U.N. or
something,� Joanna shrugged, �It's like everyone knows there's something huge
and crazy going on, but the whole government expects us all to treat it like
they're just a few foreign exchange students with weird accents or funny hats
wandering around getting into stuff with normal people, but folks are freaking
out about it, and I don't blame them.�


 


����������� �I dunno,
but I don't think it's going to get better any time soon,� I admitted,
gesturing towards the television, �You see that?� Not fifty miles away from here some Chinese
restaurant kicked one of them out after she ate literally two hundred pounds of
crab rangoons and now their whole family just disappeared.� Apparently the restaurant family's neighbors
asked a few questions and some FBI-looking dude said they'd been relocated for
their own protection, I don't know what this is all about, but it's not going
to end well.�


 


����������� �Well,
strangers or no strangers, it's going to end badly for us next month if I don't
figure out a way to bring in more money,� Joanna said, �You'd think someone
would at least be interesting in renting our spare bedroom.�


 


����������� �Yeah; I
still can't believe your sister signed the lease with us and then a month later
moved halfway across the country to work on a blueberry farm,� I said, shaking
my head, �But hey, maybe we're just due to have our luck take a turn for the
better.�


 


����������� �I wish I
had that kind of faith in our fortunes,� Joanna said ruefully, �But since fate
probably isn't going to hand us a fat envelop full of cash anytime this
afternoon, I'm going to go take off these clothes and get in the shower; you
think you might be up for joi-�


 


����������� There was a
knock at the front door; polite, yet formal- the kind of knock that comes from
awkward, earnest college kids trying to convert you to their religion, or a
freshly-minted girl scout selling cookies.


 


����������� �Wait,
don't answer it,� Joanna told me wearily, �Remember that guy last week who was
trying to sell us new windows for half an hour even though you told him we
don't even own the place?�


 


����������� �Hey now,
for all you know, some rich great-aunt of your just died and left you a
fortune,� I suggested, �And if it's someone selling something, I'll deal with
fending them off while you go get your shower, okay?�


 


����������� �Fine, but
I've got a feeling this is going to be a huge pain in the butt,� my girlfriend
insisted, though she didn't move to stop me as I unlocked the door, opening it
and letting in the warm sun of the fading afternoon, illuminating the figure
that stood on our front steps.


 


����������� �Holy crap-
it's- it's one of them-� Joanna stammered, before catching herself.


 


����������� �Whoa, I
uh, wha- how can I help you?� I said, sounding only slightly more put together,
and far from making myself out to be an intelligent representative of the human
race.


 


����������� �Oh, um,
hi!� The figure on the doorstep said with effusive awkwardness, �I'm here
about, occupying, um, no, that's not it, uh, renting, your vacant chamber, er,
room.� Is it still available?� I came as soon as I could- I only read the
notice this morning.�


 


����������� Joanna and
I glanced at each other nervously.� There
was no denying that this was one of the strangers.


 


����������� She was
about average height, with a face that was cute without really being remarkable
in any particular way, and that was as far as you could say she was normal, a
little bit on the curvy side, like most of them; just busty enough that I felt
myself looking for a split-second too long, with hips that flared out
fetchingly, and maybe just a little bit of a belly.� She wore a leather satchel slung across her
chest, its strap sliding between her breasts, and was absolutely naked aside
from that, just like the rest of them.�
Her skin- I'm not even sure it was skin- her body looked like she had
been cast out of lime-flavored jello- sunlight passed through her like a slice
of lime- and all of her, her hair, her teeth, was made off the same substance,
with only her eyes bearing some odd but cheerful glint like a Greek statue come
to life.


 


����������� �So, um, is
it?� the stranger asked, as I realized I had been staring far too long and
intensely already.


 


����������� �Ah, is
what now?� I answered dumbly, Joanna still sitting on the couch in what I
expected was a state of shock.


 


����������� �Your
chamber- room,� she corrected herself, like someone who had studied a foreign
language assiduously but was struggling to use it naturally while traveling
abroad, �If it is still uninhabited, I would like to pay you money for it.�


 


����������� �Oh, uh,
right, let me check with my girlfriend here; her name's on the lease and she's
actually the one who placed the ad,� I said, stalling as I tried to collect my
wits, �Um, the room's still available, isn't it, hon?�


 


����������� �Right,�
Joanna said, recovering her equilibrium before me, �It's still available, three
hundred a month and uh, no pets, no smokers, if you're interested.�


 


����������� �Excellent,�
the stranger enthused, looking greatly relieved, �I do not have any livestock,
and to the best of my knowledge I am not flammable.� I am still struggling to understand your
currency though- will this be enough?�


 


����������� She reached
into her satchel and produced an oddly-fashioned envelope before handing it to
me.� I half expected it to be wet or
sticky; her entire body seemed to dance on the brink of being liquid, but as I
accepted it, it was completely dry, just slightly warm like anything else that
was just held close to a person's body.�
Wishing I had spent more time of those �Etiquette with the Strangers�
sites that had been popping up all over, I figured out how to open it and
leafed through the bills inside, not sure whether to be surprised at how much
cash this creature had just handed me.


 


����������� �Yeah, so,
actually, this is enough for almost two years' rent if you want to stay that
long,� I said, trying to sound calm as I practically heard Joanna's pulse
quickening from across the room, �You know you can just pay us month by month
if you'd rather?�


 


����������� �Oh, um,
really?� the stranger said, sounding oddly flustered, �I was, ah, told that
most people would insist on payment up front- that we were to expect suspicion
from- no- I am sorry, I think I am insulting you- no, please, I trust you to
keep the currency and thank you for your trust in me.� I- my name is Reyna and this is- excuse me, I
am still learning- I do not have many possessions to bring but I will be here
again in a few hours, if that will not be an inconvenience?�


 


����������� �No, no,
that'll be fine, ah, Reyna, right hon?� I answered, glancing back at my stunned
girlfriend for reassurance, �We're usually up pretty late anyways so, yeah,
just come on back when you're ready and we'll- well, I'll make sure we've got
an extra key ready for you by then.� Is
that okay?�


 


����������� �This is
splendid; you have been far less skeptical than I was led to believe,� Reyna
said, sounding very relieved, offering a modest little bow as she spoke, �I
thank you for your hospitality.� I will
try not to take very long nor inconvenience you and your mate.�


 


����������� And then,
without further ado, she turned and walked down the front steps, turned onto
the sidewalk and strode off down the street as if everything that had just
happened was as natural as could be, leaving Joanna and I staring after her.


 


����������� �Holy
crap.� Joanna said, finishing her thought from earlier, �They really are made
out of slime, aren't they?�


 


����������� �Yeah, they
totally are,� I muttered numbly as I closed the door and made my way back to
the couch, envelope still in hand.


 


����������� �Holy
crap,� Joanna said again, revisiting what seemed to be a new theme for her,
�So, one of them is going to be living here, with us.� We are so screwed.�


 


����������� �Well, she
did just give me five thousand, three hundred and, uh, eighty seven dollars,� I
said as I thumbed through the envelope's contents, �so she seems to trust us at
least.� What's the worst that could
happen?�


 


����������� �Um, aside
from the fact that that creature isn't even human- no matter how perfect her
tits were, and don't think I didn't see you looking- people who cross them seem
to end up disappearing after the government gets involved,� Joanna argued,
�It's like having a diplomat from North Korea move in with us- every little
thing we do from here on out is going to be like walking through a minefield.�


 


����������� �Hey now,
maybe it won't be like that,� I suggested, deciding to let the remark about
staring at Reyna's richly-proportioned bosom pass without rebuttal, �She seemed
pretty relieved that we didn't freak out any more than we did, so maybe this'll
be cool.� Like, a hundred years from now
we'll be in the history books as the people that helped welcome the strangers
into human society.�


 


����������� �Or well be
the ones who inadvertently taught them what they needed to do to enslave
humanity,� Joanna retorted, �Or clone us, or eat us, or brainwash us, or all of
the above.�


 


����������� �Well,
brainwashing or no, she just handed us enough money to keep us afloat for at
last six months,� I said pointedly, �So unless she comes back in a couple hours
with a brainwashing machine, I think we ought to cut her some slack.�


 


����������� �Mmh, is
that your interest in interplanetary peace talking?� Joanna shot back, �Or just
you wanting to see that bouncy green ass of hers jiggling around the house?�


 


����������� �Fine; do *you*
want to chase after her with this fat wad of cash and tell her to go to hell?�
I countered, thrusting the envelope at Joanna.


 


����������� �No- sorry,
you're right,� she admitted, �We do need the money.� Okay- these clothes are making me crazy; I'm
going to get into my pajamas, have like, more drinks than I know I should, and
I'll be in a better mood when star girl comes back this evening.�


 


 


����������� 


 


����������� After
supper, Joanna was draped over the couch, dressed only in her bra and a pair of
flannel pants, vacantly scrolling through her phone as she finished off a
bottle of a local lager and dropped it to the floor where it clinked against
three other recent empties.� I was
sitting at the desk looking distractedly over some schoolwork, when the same
polite knock came at the door.


 


����������� �Oh,
dammit, she's back already?� Joanna said with a start, nearly tumbling off the
sofa as she tried to get up, �Whoa, right, it's nearly nine already.�


 


����������� �Here, I'll
let her in in a second,� I said, standing and moving towards the door, �You, go
throw on a shirt or something so we look at least a little respectable.�


 


����������� �Are you
telling me these aren't respectable?� Joanna teased, cupping her modest breasts
and smooshing them together, then barging past me towards the front door,
�Wait, don't answer that.� Anyways, if
she's going to be living with us for a while, there's no way I'm going to force
myself to get all dress up just to lay around the house in the evening.� I mean, she was bare-ass naked when she came
by this afternoon, I'm at least covered up- let her in!�


 


����������� With an
enthusiastic yank, Joanna pulled the door open and there on the front steps,
stood Reyna, just as she had been a few hours before, naked, green, glistening
uncannily in the moonlight.� She still
carried a small satchel over one shoulder, its strap beguilingly slipped
between her ample breasts, and in one hand she now carried a small suitcase
remarkable only in that it looked like it was at least sixty years old.


 


����������� �Hello
again, I am here to begin living with you,� Reyna announced as cheerfully as an
exchange student on their first day of school, �I am sorry to be so late; I
imagine you both must want to rest.� I
promise I will try not to disrupt your habits too severely.�


 


����������� �No
worries,� Joanna replied with a lopsided grin, �I don't have a freaking job, so
I get to sleep in all day, and he's always up until two in the morning
anyway.� Come on in.�


 


����������� �Oh, thank
you,� Reyna said, giving her head a little bow that set her entire figure
slightly aquiver as she stepped across the threshold, �Please, can you show me
where I will be residing?�


 


����������� �Um, yeah;
right up the stairs here,� I said, waving an arm towards the second floor, �Here;
do you want help bringing in the rest of your stuff?�


 


����������� �The rest
of my-?� Reyna echoed, looking down at herself perplexedly, �This is all of me
that there is right now.� Was I supposed
to bring more?�


 


����������� �Oh, no, I
mean, your luggage,� I clarified, feeling strangely awkward, �You know, a big
suitcase, a computer, I dunno- some kind of weird alien furniture thing?�


 


����������� �I did not
know that those were expected, I apologize,� Reyna said, �I have everything I
require for comfortable habitation right here.�


 


����������� �In that
case, let my boyfriend show you up to your room,� Joanna said, shooting me an
icy look, �I'll follow you up; no need to give him more of a view than you
already have.�


 


����������� �Certainly,�
Reyna said, in perfect innocence, �Please, lead the way.�


 


����������� I walked up
the stairs, down the hall to the spare bedroom, and pushed the door open, Reyna
and Joanna following close behind.�


 


����������� �So, yeah,
here it is,� Joanna said, �Uh, the closet's empty if you ever have any, you
know, clothes, the bathroom is right across the hall, there's clean sheets on
the bed if you, er, sleep, and if you eat anything in the fridge, just pitch in
a little bit towards the household groceries, okay?� Sorry, I guess we should have repainted
before we put that ad out; I've been meaning to do a little more of that since
I've had so much free time lately but I've kind of kept putting it off.�


 


����������� �Oh, but
this is just perfect!� Reyna gushed, as delighted as if we'd ushered her into a
queenly suite boasting a hot tub and a view of the mountains, �This is
everything I require and more.� Thank you
so much for your generosity in sharing this with me!�


 


����������� �It's cool;
I mean, you're paying for it,� Joanna said, not quite sure how to respond to
such effusiveness, �I'm just glad it's good enough for you.�


 


����������� �Please;
you are too modest,� Reyna gushed, �Here, let me share a little something with
you- a token of my thankfulness.�


 


����������� �It's okay,
you don't need to-� Joanna insisted as Reyna suddenly moved towards her, arms
outstretched, �Really, it's not-�


 


����������� Her voice
was stifled as the gleaming green girl brought my girlfriend in close as
planted her lips against my girlfriend's.�
Joanna protested, squirming ineffectually to escape Reyna's
embrace.� Her eyes went wide, and I
realized this went beyond her just trying to get out of an awkward thank you
from a strange culture. A moment later I heard the sound of fabric straining,
and Joanna suddenly stopped trying to extricate herself from Reyna's arms and
reached up to clutch at her own chest.�
And that's when I saw them.


 


����������� Joanna's
breasts were growing larger.� Even with
Reyna's translucent body pressed against her, I could see my girlfriend's bosom
spilling out of a bra that minutes before had comfortably cradled her B-cups.� By the time I noticed what was happening, she
already had to be a C, and a pretty full one at that; over the next few seconds
I watched her swell to a D cup, and then a DD, the stitches on her bra
beginning to pop as her breasts strained against its embrace.� Through our transparent guest, I could see
Joanna's boobs beginning to spilled out underneath her overmatched cups as
well- pressed between the two women's bodies, they bulged out to either side of
her chest, now almost as impressively as Reyna's.� 


 


����������� Joanna was
utterly overwhelmed.� She wasn't really
struggling anymore, but her eyes were shut tightly, and she bore an expression
of discomfort as she made small, muffled gurgling noises while her breasts
neared the size of cantaloupes, Reyna still kissing her as if this was the most
natural thing in the world.� As I
watched, spellbound, Joanna's breasts gently surged out larger and larger as
she was being pumped full, Reyna continuing as if she were intent on pouring
all of herself into my helpless girlfriend's bosom.� 


 


����������� Joanna
groaned softly, grasping weakly at the sides of her expanding breasts, when the
silence was split by a loud pop.� In an
instant, Reyna released Joanna and retreated several steps across the room,
looking absolutely mortified.� Joanna
fell back hard on her rump, as her bare breasts, her bra having just snapped
asunder, smacked against her chest with a resonant slap.� For a moment none of us moved, though Joanna
was panting, her breasts swollen at least to G-cups, riding firm and high
against her chest.� Her small nipples
more vividly erect than I had ever seen them, her areolae tight and rimpled as
a blush spread across her now-expansive bosom.


 


����������� �Oh, I'm so
sorry!� Reyna apologized earnestly, her own full bosom now considerably
diminished in size, �I- I did not mean to damage your clothing!�


 


����������� �Oh, fuck,�
Joanna said, still sitting on the floor where she had fallen, not quite in
response as she tentatively felt herself up, �What did you do to my tits?�


 


����������� �Please, I
will repay you for the damages in full,� Reyna assured her, �I- I am sorry, I
did not mean to do something like this on my first night here, and you have
been so very kind.� Here- let me be alone
for the night, and I will make it up for you tomorrow, I promise.�


 


����������� �What the
hell?� Joanna breathed, a look of near panic on her face as raced to get out
the door, cursing as her one of her breasts collided with her arm as she rolled
over, �Fuck!�


 


����������� �So, okay
then,� I said, trying to sound slightly more composed as I backed towards the
door as well, �Um, you have a good night and, ah, I guess we'll see you in the
morning.�


 


����������� I closed
the door behind me, Reyna still standing there looking embarrassed, and from
down the hall heard Joanna falling into bed.�
I came in a moment later, and she was sitting up against the headboard,
staring at her suddenly-impressive bustline with a blend of excitement and
terror.


 


����������� �Fuck, what
did she do to me?� Joanna asked, glancing up at me as I shut the door and came
over to the bed where she lay, �One second she's sticking her tongue down my
throat and the next, I just feel this- I don't know- slime or something flowing
into me.� Then I feel my chest getting
heavier- my bra feels like it's shrinking, and then- *this* happens!�


 


����������� �Are you
going to be okay; do they hurt?� I asked anxiously, trying not to get too turned
on by the sight of my now-buxom girlfriend in such obvious distress.


 


����������� �Okay?� How am I supposed to get a job anywhere aside
from a strip-club with a set of boobs nearly the size of my head?� Joanna
lamented, �And they're so full and firm; everyone I know is going to think I
just went out and got a pair of oversized implants, even though I've been
telling all my friends we've been broke for months.� Damn, we let that- creature- into our house
and ten minutes later I'm ready to join the freak show. �Geez, even you're probably not going to want
to fuck me with a couple of melons like these hanging off my chest, are you?�


 


����������� �Well,
first things first,� I said trying not to get ahead of myself regarding
Joanna's overdeveloped condition, �So it's not like they're all painful or
anything, right?� You don't need to go to
a hospital or anything right now?�


 


����������� �No, as
much as I look like they're ready to pop, they don't hurt like that,� Joanna
said, calming down a bit as she massaged them tentatively, exploring for the
first time the true extent of her freshly-enlarged bosom, �I mean, the weight's
going to take some getting used to, I think, and they're really sensitive right
now, like just touching them like this makes me- *Ohhhhh*-�


 


����������� Joanna
sucked a sharp breath through clenched teeth as she gave one of her protruding
nipples an experimental pinch, a shudder coursing through her body.


 


����������� �Oh, these
things are way too sensitive,� she breathed, still fondling her breasts with
one hand as her other found its way past the waistband of her pajamas, �Wow, I
just realized how wet this is making me- I can't remember the last time I got
so horny so fast.�


 


����������� �Here, let
me help you with that,� I said, quickly pulling off my own clothes as I climbed
into bed with Joanna, �You look like you've got more than you can handle all by
yourself now.�


 


����������� �Well, I
guess I don't have to worry about whether you still think I'm sexy,� she
murmured, staring appreciatively at me, �Come on and get me naked too.�


 


����������� She
shivered as I slowly pulled her flannel pants down past her slender hips, her
hand still stroking the cleft between her trim thighs.


 


����������� �Ouch,
stop- they're *really* tender right now,� she warned me as I climbed on
top of her, taking one of her fat peaks in my mouth and sucking it gently,
�Okay, wait, just go easy on them, that actually feels really- mhmm, *really*
nice right now.�


 


����������� I'd always
enjoyed playing with Joanna's breasts when we were in bed; and she'd always
been deliciously responsive when I teased and sucked on them.� Now though, I barely even knew where to
start.� Her breasts bulged fully six
inches away from her chest, and in spite of their firmness, with her on her
back they tended to spread apart, which would take some getting used to.� Just running my tongue against the hot
pebbled skin of her nipple made her gasp, her hands clutching desperately
around my arms.


 


����������� �Fuck- oh
fuck; this is torture,� she whispered raggedly, �Stop playing around- I feel
like I'm about to explode and I need you in me right- Ahhhh!�


 


����������� She cried
out as I slid inside of her- she was sopping wet and swollen with lust as the
womanly walls of her inner body surrendered to me.� I buried my face in the warmth of her bosom
again, licking, sucking, teasing her quivering breasts.� Joanna tightened around me as she came and
came again, as I pumped away at her steadily.�
She arched her back, spreading her legs further to let me in deeper and
moaned wordlessly as I accepted the invitation eagerly.


 


����������� Her large
breasts bounced roughly in rhythm with our bodies.� Joanna cupped her hands against their tops to
keep from slapping herself in the face, and winced as their delicate mass
smacked against her body, as they brushed heavily against my arms as I took
her.� She came, again and again- in the
back of my mind I worried about Reyna hearing us from her nearby bedroom, and
slightly deeper wondered what would happen if she got curious and came through
the door that I had forgotten to lock.�
I'd never made Joanna come like this before, not so hard, so fast, each
climax striking right in the wake of her last.�
How long had we been going, ten minutes, fifteen?� I was amazed I'd been able to control myself
this long, as my girlfriend writhed beneath me, her red hair plastered with
sweat to her face, her neck, her heaving shoulders, a flush nearly as bright
spreading across the expanse of her undulant chest.


 


����������� �Come on,
come on- you need to finish,� Joanna urged, clasping at her bosom with
desperate protectiveness, �They were already sore before we started and now I
feel like they're gonna pop if you keep pounding me like this.�


 


����������� My lips met
hers, and I kissed her fiercely as her burning breasts pressed tight against my
chest.� She struggled- I shot myself
inside of her, her hips still rolling as she received me.� I was complete.� I rolled off of her, her tight depths tugging
at me as I pulled away, Joanna's swollen breasts surging as she panted for
breath, her nipples as large as if she were a lactating mother, desperate to
express her milk.


 


����������� �So, still
worried I'm not going to think you're desirable?� I asked, rolling onto my side
to admire her magnified profile.


 


����������� �Oh my
gosh-� Joanna gasped, her hands still resting on her more-than-ample bosom, �I
came so many times I lost count- that was amazing.�


 


����������� �Well, if
these turn out to be permanent, you're not going to have to ask me twice if you
want that kind of treatment on a nightly basis from here on out,� I said with a
wink, running my palm across her toned belly.


 


����������� �Oh my- if
we did this every night, I don't think I'd be able to walk after a week,�
Joanna panted, �Still, what if this wasn't a one-time thing?� What if that- Reyna, meets me at breakfast
tomorrow and decides to blow me up to twice this size?�


 


����������� �Ah, well,
yeah, how would you feel about that?� I asked, trying not to get too caught up
in visualizing that exact possibility.


 


����������� �I mean,
can you even imagine me with tits as big as watermelons?� she asked
incredulously, �If being this big has this kind of effect on them, just feeling
the air against my skin at that size would be enough to leave me a quivering
puddle of lust.�


 


����������� �Well, why
don't you try talking to her in the morning, or whenever she gets up?� I
suggested, not yet daring to touch my girlfriend's aching bosom any more just
yet, �If you tell her how you feel, I bet she'll respect that and then the
problem's solved.� I mean, if it's what
you really want, she might even be able to shrink your boobs down to the size
they used to be.�


 


����������� �What, and
give *these* back?� Joanna shot back, then pausing as she realized what
she was saying, �I mean, as long as my boobs don't get *much* bigger than
this, and as long as you don't mind having a girlfriend with a pair of huge,
sensitive tits to ravish in bed, I think I could get used to not seeing my feet
anymore.� I mean, if you think that'd be
okay.�


 


����������� �I just
want you to be happy,� I told her, gently stroking her thigh, �I'll support
whatever you decide to do one hundred percent.�


 


����������� �Oh, well,
in that case, yeah,� Joanna said, staring up at the ceiling as she distractedly
caressed her lush bosom, her voice becoming more distant, �Maybe I will have a
talk with her in the morning.� She seems
nice enough.� I bet we'll be able to work
out something between the two of us.�


 


����������� And then
she was asleep, her full breasts rising and falling gently with her
breathing.� I pulled a blanket up over
her legs; though her nipples were still tight against the cool night air, I
didn't want to lay any extra weight on her already-overburdened bosom.� I threw the other half of the blanket over myself,
and as I thought about whether I should get up and turn out the light, I
drifted off as well.


 


����������� 


 


 


����������� It was
Saturday, when I usually savored the chance to sleep in, but by 9:30 I could
hear the sound my girlfriend's laughter.�
I pulled on some shorts and a shirt, and made my way down the steps,
greeted by the sight of Joanna and Reyna in the kitchen.


 


����������� Joanna,
unsurprisingly, was wearing nothing but a pair of panties and an old t-shirt
that did nothing to disguise her generous endowments, her nipples still thick
and fat as they thrust against the worn fabric.�
She was sitting, bare feet up on the kitchen table, with a half-empty
bottle of beer in her hand.


 


����������� Reyna was
leaning over the stove, where she had apparently just finished bringing the
biggest pot in the house to a boil, steam swirling hypnotically against her
green body.� As I watched, Joanna
giggling the entire time, Reyna picked up a ten-pack of off-brand mac and
cheese boxes, opened one, fished out the cheese packet, and then poured all the
macaroni into the pot.� And then she did
it for the next one, and the next, until she was more than halfway through, and
Joanna was making sounds as if she was in danger of snorting beer out her nose.


 


����������� �Good
morning, you two,� I said, trying to figure out if this was just how life was
going to be around here from now on, �You uh, making breakfast there, Reyna?�


 


����������� �Oh yes, I
very much am making breakfast,� Reyna chirped, continuing to pour the boxes
into the steaming pot, �You may have noticed, I gave up a considerable amount
of my mass to your mate last night, and I would prefer to replenish it before I
go outside again, but I was worried that eating so much of your food would make
me a bad guest.� Joanna is so very selfless
and kind though- she told me that this food is so inexpensive that you call it
'junk' and I could eat as much as I wanted, so now I am preparing it for
consumption, though I am not used to cooking, so I hope I am not getting the
process too terribly wrong.�


 


����������� �Well,
other than the fact that you've making enough to last least a week right there,
I think you've got a pretty good handle on it,� I said encouragingly as she
poured in the tenth package of pasta.


 


����������� �Thank you;
I worry that I still have much to learn about your ways,� Reyna said, �And it
would be so very inappropriate for me to go out in public so diminished.�


 


����������� Then, as if
it was the most natural thing in the world, Reyna took one of the cheese
packets, seized it with both hands above the pot, and squeezed it until it
exploded.� Cheese spattered against the
wall, the stove, and all over her front.�
She was barely fazed.


 


����������� �This seems
like a very inefficient way of doing this,� Reyna said, slightly at a loss as
Joanna snickered from her seat.


 


����������� �Oh, maybe
if you tried tearing the package open and then squeezing it into the pot, that
would work better,� I suggested, �But you know, you're really supposed to
finish cooking the pasta before you-


 


����������� �Of
course,� Reyna said brightly, picking up the next one and doing just that,
�Yes, this is much better!�


 


����������� Neither of
us said a word as we watched, Reyna trying so hard not to laugh out loud that I
was afraid she was going to fall out of her chair, though her lush bosom did
bounce distractingly from the effort, and me trying to just roll with the fact
that we had in our house a visitor from- well, somewhere very different- and
this was just happening right now.


 


����������� Her face
and chest still splattered with cheese, Reyna proceeded to decant all the other
packets into the pot, then planted her hands on her hips with a look of
satisfaction as she surveyed the bubbling cauldron of noodles and cheese
globules.


 


����������� �Splendid;
this is far more appetizing than I anticipated,� she announced, �I don't think
I realized just how famished I've let myself become on my way here.�


 


����������� And then,
before Joanna or I could stop her, Reyna picked up the boiling pot with her
bare hands, raised it to her lips, and began to drink it down in great,
desperate gulps.� By the time I realized
what was happening, it was too late to stop her, and by the time that had
dawned on me, I realized that for all I knew, this was just how breakfast was
done wherever she came from, as Reyna proceeded to pour boiling cheese and
macaroni soup into her mouth.� I was
still standing there on high alert as she drained the contents into herself;
Joanna was sitting there watching with rapt amusement.


 


����������� As I
watched, Reyna's color began to turn to a lighter green, and a few seconds
later, I noticed small bubbles effervescing through her body, and a few wisps
of steam rising from her shoulders.� A
moment later I saw that all those gallons and calories were obviously going
somewhere, as her already-voluptuous rear was rapidly filling out.� Like a pair of green soap bubbles, her cheeks
were swelling up, her hips broadening as she gulped down her meal.� Her legs too, were growing thicker, more
sleek, her surface taking on a more jigglesome aspect, becoming more jello-like
as I watched, Reyna glistening wetly as her figure crossed the boundary from
thick to positively pear-shaped.


 


����������� Reyna set
down the pot- it rang empty as a bell against the stove top- and turned to face
us, her hips still spreading just as impressively from the front, and I saw
that her breasts had been restored to their former glory as well, and then
some, wider than her chest and hanging down nearly to her navel.� Curls of steam rose from what I couldn't
think of as other than her hair, and she smiled as she glanced down at herself,
one hand patting her slightly-plump belly in satisfaction.


 


����������� �Mmm, so
much water and sustenance all at once, I had not believed that a land of such
bounties existed,� she sighed, �Oh, but look what a mess I have made of
myself!� Apologies, one moment and I will
be presentable again.�


 


����������� Without a
second's hesitation, Reyna raised one cheese-splattered arm to her lips and
began to lick it off with a tongue that seemed just a little too long and
talented for a being so sweet-voiced and innocent as she.� Her other arm received the same treatment,
and then, as Joanna leered and I regretted that I wasn't sitting down behind
something, Reyna hefted one of her full, lustrous breasts and proceeded to lick
the cheese from its surface as well, just as nonchalantly as if she were
licking an errant dab of frosting from her thumb, rather than putting on such a
tantalizing show.� I finally had to take
a seat at the kitchen table when she took her nipple between her lips, and kept
hoping that Joanna wasn't watching me as my shorts drew tight while Reyna let
her freshly-tongue-bathed breast drop heavily against her yielding body and
proceeded to give its sister the same treatment.


 


����������� At last she
stood before use, boasting the most impressive hourglass figure I had ever
seen, with broad-flaring hips, a pair of breasts each larger than her head, and
a look of satisfaction on her face as if she were dressed to go out and take on
the world.� She frowned.


 


����������� �Hmmph, I
think I might have done just as well to consume a little less,� Reyna said,
just a hint of annoyance in her dulcet voice, �I mean, I have seen women among
your people with far more bountiful figures, but if I meet with any of my kind,
I worry that they will think me a show-off, going about my business so
abundantly well-fed.� I wonder if-�


 


����������� �Actually,�
Joanna said, plunking down her empty bottle as she rose from the table with a
mien that suggested this had been her plan all along, �If you're looking to
unload a little bit of that weight before you go off to do- well, you already
told me once and I still don't understand half of it- whatever for the day; I
suppose you could talk me into giving you somewhere to stash a few of those
curves.�


 


����������� �Oh, but I
couldn't,� Reyna responded, �I already damaged your garment last night, and
doing the same to your shirt this morning would be unforgivable!�


 


����������� �Well,
these are stretchy enough,� Joanna said seductively, tugging at the waistband
of her panties, �Just promise me I'll end up gaining weight in all the same
places you just did, except for up top, of course.�


 


����������� �Thank you,
thank you!� Reyna answered, immediately going reaching towards my girlfriend,
�Wait, know that you are more sensitive to temperature than I am, and after my
breakfast, my internal temperature is still nearly a hundred and sixty degrees-
I would not wish to burn you.� Here,
allow me a moment.�


 


����������� Reyna
turned- words fail me to describe how full and juicy she looked from behind-
and opened the fridge.� She took out two
full gallon jugs of whole milk; usually enough to last us through the week,
opened one, and proceeded to pour it into her mouth.� The gleaming emerald of her body dimmed
slightly as it cooled her down, though it also added at least an inch to her
more-than-healthy bust and her enthralling hips.� Without pausing for breath, she uncapped the
next and disposed of it the same way, setting it aside with a contented sigh
and now extravagantly buxom, her full belly now looking almost too indulgent
for comfort.


 


����������� �Oh, I am
much more temperate now, but I have even more mass to divest myself of if I do
not want the others to think me a glutton,� Reyna said with dismay as Joanna
eyed her with what looked for all the world like regret at her earlier offer,
�Still, you have been so gracious to me, I am sure you won't mind accepting
just a little bit more than last night, will you?�


 


����������� Unsure
about padding out her figure with quite as much as Reyna seemed inclined to
offer, Joanna, took a step back, staring doubtfully at the green woman's
plumped-up bosom, full tummy and lush, swaying hips.� But Reyna gave her no time to object; gliding
over, enfolding my girlfriend in her firm, slippery embrace, and kissing
her.� Joanna gagged slightly as Reyna
began to pour herself down her throat, and the consequences came almost
instantly.


 


����������� Joanna's
butt, which had always been sort of flat, was rounding out before my eyes, her
panties sinking deeper between her cheeks she swiftly developed a very shapely
behind.� Joanna reached down with both
hands and gave her newly upholstered seat a squeeze, obviously delighted with
these new developments.� Her hips, once
barely wider than her waist, blossomed into alluring curves, and her lean
thighs were steadily filling out; the gap between them vanishing as I watched
with rapt attention.


 


����������� Joanna gave
a stifled murmur of pleasure as the lower half of her figure grew beyond
fetching and right into the realm of alluring.�
Her hands still kneaded at her increasingly ample rear, looking smaller
and smaller in comparison as her seat rose like fresh buns with too much yeast
left to rise in the kitchen, and I sensed that she had gained more than she had
bargain for, while Reyna gave no sign of letting up, and indeed, with her own
figure still far fuller than Joanna's, it looked like she still had an awful
lot to give my quaking girlfriend.�
Joanna's thighs were getting fuller by the second, touching together,
and then squeezing each other as they vied for growing room, gently trembling
as they inflated with yielding flesh.�
Her hips now spread wider than her shoulders, tantalizingly round and
womanly, and I realized Joanna was squirming a little more uncomfortably as
Reyna blissfully continued to pump her full.


 


����������� And then I
saw why- across her back, from under her shoulders to just a few inches above
where it brushed her broadening hips- Joanna's shirt was becoming tighter, as
Reyna evidently had decided to share the weight she gained from all that milk
in an all too obvious pair of places.� It
wasn't just her breasts though; I saw that Joanna was starting to get a little
chubby in the middle, signs of a nascent muffin top threatening to spill over
the taut waistband of her panties.


 


����������� Effortlessly
holding Joanna in place with one arm, Reyna reached down and slipped a couple
fingers between that band of stretching elastic, tugging on my girlfriend's
panties appraisingly then, curiosity satisfied, she clutched Joanna tightly in
her arms again and flooded her increasingly voluptuous form with one forceful
burst.� In the blink of an eye Joanna's
hips surged out by a couple more inches, her already-opulent ass ballooning as if
she had suddenly been injected with thirty pounds of jelly, which I suppose
wasn't far from the truth.� Out of
growing room on the inside, her thighs jiggled as they billowed outwards, even
her calves now becoming invitingly well-rounded.


 


����������� I wondered
how many pounds a second Reyna was forcing into my increasingly
hourglass-shaped girlfriend, one, two, more?�
It had to be less than five, I decided as I stared, mesmerized by the
sight of Joanna broadening to such delightful proportions.� Even if it was one, I decided, those pounds
were adding up in a hurry as Joanna became ever more bottom-heavy.


 


����������� There was
the creak of straining fabric, and in an instant Reyna released Joanna, who
would have fallen to the floor again had she not caught the kitchen table with
one generously-cushioned hip, setting her entire lower body wobbling
bewitchingly.� She now sported a soft,
slightly plump tummy, and her shirt was drawn tight over breasts that were at
least three cups fuller than they had been five minutes before.


 


����������� �Oh fuck;
I'm huge,� Joanna sighed, groping at her enlarged figure as she tried to find
her balance, �When I said I wanted to be a little bit curvier down here, I
didn't know you were going to pump, like, another seventy pounds into me!�


 


����������� �You're
welcome!� Reyna replied brightly, �I always try to surpass what expected of
me.�


 


����������� �And my
tits- they just feel so soft and heavy too,� Joanna protested as their
jigglesome flesh spilled between her outstretched fingers, �I'm shaped like
some kind of a bimbo from a dirty comic strip now.�


 


����������� �Of course;
I could never let myself make the same error twice and fill you until your
clothing was damaged, �Reyna explained obligingly, �So when I realized you were
in danger of exceeding the capacity of your undergarment, I made sure to direct
my attention back to your mammaries, since your shirt had more than enough room
to accommodate further expansion.� In
fact, it look as if it could still stretch another fifteen percent before failing,
if you are really interested, I suppose I could share a little more of myself
with you and still appear appropriate in public.�


 


����������� �No, no!- I
mean, no, thank you,� Joanna nearly shouted, retreating to the far side of the
table as fast as her plump legs could carry her, �You've uh- already been far
too generous- it would be so rude of me to ask for more.� This is plenty, more than plenty, even- Here,
I'm probably making you late for- wherever it is that you're going to be all
day- already.� We're good, you just uh,
go have a good day, alright?�


 


����������� �Thank
you!� Reyna said cheerfully, adjusting the strap of her satchel to fit more
comfortably between her two large breasts, though Joanna's were now noticeably
larger, �You have a good day as well; I will see the two of you this evening.�


 


����������� She turned-
I still couldn't ignore the sight of her sleek, emerald backside as she
flounced to the front door, closing it behind her solidly.


 


����������� �Fuck, I've
got more ass than like, three rap videos put together,� Joanna asked, her eyes
darting between me and her sensuously-expanded body, �What am I gonna do?�


 


����������� �I don't
know,� I countered, �What were you expecting when you asked her to do exactly
the thing that just happened that you totally asked her for?�


 


����������� �I don't
know- I just wanted to fill out a pair of jeans a little bit better, maybe look
a little less top-heavy after our girl here gave me boobs big enough to smother
someone with- maybe even just give you a little something more to hold onto
when we're in bed,� Joanna fumed, �I didn't want- you know- such a huge ass
that I'm going to need to sit on two chairs at a time now and tits bigger than
my head to keep them company!� And look
at this, she made me fat too- my tummy's absorbing my panties like I'm the blob
or something.�


 


����������� �Hey now,
you're just a little more- voluptuous- that's all,� I said, trying to sound
reassuring,� I mean, it really would look weird for you to have these thick,
sensual thighs and a soft, jiggly butt, and such hot, swollen breasts and still
be as skinny as one of those half-starved supermodels.� I think, I think you actually look better
with a little more weight- more feminine, you know?�


 


����������� �Yeah?� So you like the new me even if I'm so
ridiculously curvy that I'll probably get whistled at in church?� Joanna asked,
a mischievous gleam in her eye as she smiled and tugged at the edge of her snug
t shirt, her plump nipples straining against the fabric, �Would you like to see
a little bit more?�


 


����������� �Only if
you're feeling up to sharing,� I said, trying not to sound too eager as she
stepped towards me, rolling her broad fertile hips seductively.


 


����������� �Well then,
you're in for quite a show,� she said, slowing pulling her shirt up and over
her head, her breasts slipping free and falling with a clap against her body,
as she threw her shirt aside, �What do you think of these?�


 


����������� Reyna had
filled her breasts with much more than I had thought.� They were wider than her body now by a couple
inches, hanging full and heavy and down to her belly button.� Joanna's areolae were pink and puffy, bulging
out slightly from the smooth curve of her breasts and their pale, tender skin,
and her nipples were as hard as if she'd spent the morning standing topless in
front of the freezer.


 


����������� �Wow, she
really did make you grow,� I said numbly, wrapping Joanna in my arms, her
bloated bosom filling the space between us, spilling out around my arms as I
held her close.


 


����������� �Ouch-
careful- there's a lot more of me out front that there used to be, and it's all
still really sensitive,� Joanna admonished me, before flashing me a come-hither
smile, �Here, hold me a little tighter- my tits can probably take it.�


 


����������� I held her
closer; her swollen breasts squeezed between our bodies, the new softness of
her hips and belly tantalizingly warm, her lush thighs all but begging to
embrace me.� She kissed me, passionately,
her tongue eager for my mine as we stood there in the kitchen, and she began to
rub herself against me.


 


����������� �Mmm, I can
feel how hard you're getting,� Joanna murmured, reaching down my pants and
wrapping her fingers around me, �What is it about me that's making you so
horny?� Is it my big, fat, slutty
tits?� Is it my huge, jiggly ass that's
getting you all turned on?� Or is it the
way my thighs are just so thick and soft and I just can't wait to feel your
cock throbbing between them?�


 


����������� �Ah,� I
sighed, feeling myself growing longer in her hand, �All of them; you're just so
fucking incredible like this.�


 


����������� �Good
answer,� she smiled approvingly, letting go of me as she undid my jeans and
pulled them down to the floor, her heavy breasts brushing against my legs as
she slid to the floor, her alluringly overfed rear jutting out behind her
delightfully as she bent down.


 


����������� �Oh, but
you are ready to go,� she said with a smile, before turning away from me,
�Here, I think it's my turn to get a little more comfortable, don't you think?�


 


����������� Joanna
worked her way out of her panties, giving a couple little cries of discomfort
as she struggled to fit them past her lush callipygian charms, fighting to jam
her juicy thighs through their constrictive embrace.


 


����������� �Damn-
well, it wasn't like I was ever going to fit into these again anyway,� Joanna
swore, her panties tearing as she forced them past the fullest part of her
thighs, �I guess Reyna filled me with more than she thought she did.� I wonder if I should tell her this happened
in spite of her being so careful?�


 


����������� �Only if
you want her to apologize by pumping you up with a few more gallons of slime
next time she comes home,� I said, not exactly discouraging the idea, �You
might want to keep this to yourself if you want to still be able to fit through
doors by the end of the week.�


 


����������� �Well now,
maybe I'm still deciding how I feel about that,� she teased, standing up and
stepping back against me, her sumptuous ass full and jiggly against my rigid
member, �If you make it worth my while, I might be willing to gain a little
more in the interest of being a generous landlady and a fun girlfriend.�


 


����������� �Yeah, and
just how much is a little more?� I asked, the sweet scent of her red hair
intoxicating as I reached up and grabbed an overflowing handful of her swollen
bosom with both hands, �Are you really ready to be standing here like this, but
with breasts so huge you'll have to rest them on the table for support?� Or maybe she'll pump you full until your hips
are so wide you'll take up the entire couch all by yourself?� Or here, what if she decides that a chubby
little belly like this isn't enough and she goes and fattens you up until you
look like you're nine months pregnant?�


 


����������� �Mmm, right
now *you're* the one I want filling me,� Joanna breathed huskily, �Make me
scream and maybe you'll get to see me ask our guest for a few more fav-�


 


����������� She gasped
as I put my hands on her shoulders and roughly pushed her to the table,
flinching as her tender breasts struck the hard wood.� I drew my hands down along her back, savoring
the way they sunk into her newly-gained softness as I took her by the
hips.� Joanna awkwardly moved her feet a
little farther apart, her plump thighs parting slightly; I filled her to the
hilt.


 


����������� �Oh, fuck-
you feel huge!� she gasped, arms stretched across the table, fingers clutching
its far side.


 


����������� �Mmm, and
you feel so full and tight,� I told her, drawing back and sheathing myself
within her again, �I think Reyna plumped up more than your tits and ass.�


 


����������� �Ah- slow
down- I'm still- so sensitive-� Joanna moaned, a note of doubt creeping into
her sultry demeanor, �Wait; I'm- I'm already coming!�


 


����������� She
tightened around me, but taking things slow was the last thing on my mind right
now.� I thrust into her, Joanna's womanly
rear slapping against me as she cried out.�
I tightened my grip around her waist, pulling myself deeper as I buried
myself inside her, again and again and again.


 


����������� �Wait,
please- slow down!� she begged, bucking and rolling against me, longing for
more.


 


����������� *Slap-
slap- slap*- her fulsome behind smacked against me as I pounded her; she
whimpered wordlessly as I reached down and grabbed at her quivering rear,
savoring how heavily her full thighs felt as they clapped against my legs.


 


����������� �Fuck,
okay- you've made your point!� Joanna gasped raggedly, as another orgasm
wracked her body, her legs trembling so sorely that I knew the table was the
only thing keeping her up, �Standing up with all this added weight is hard
enough already- if you keep this up I won't be able to walk!�


 


����������� �I dunno-
that sounds like a challenge to me,� I teased, thinking about how having her
bedridden for a couple days might be fun.


 


����������� �No,
please! I don't want to be stuck on the couch, too sore and heavy to walk if
Reyna comes back and decides to make me even bigger than I already am,� Joanna
pleaded, �Wait, no, you'd probably enjoy that, wouldn't y- Mhmmmm- Ohhhh!�


 


����������� The thought
of Reyna taking advantage of my helpless girlfriend and flooding her body with
even more was all it took to push me over the edge.� Holding tight to Joanna's yielding waist, I
drove myself deep inside her as I exploded into her feminine depths; she
shuddered and convulsed around me, grinding her full hips against me urgently.


 


����������� As I pulled
free, she was still bent over the kitchen table, panting, trembling, her
swollen breasts pressed tight between her chest and the cold wood of the
table.� It took her a few minutes to
recover enough to move, and even then it was all she could do to slide off the
table and into a chair, her bountiful behind hanging several inches off of
either side, her lush breasts piled on the table in front of her, so ample that
she could have motorboated herself by just leaning forwards.


 


����������� �Okay, so
maybe being built like a chubby sex goddess has its perks,� she finally mused,
tentatively kneading her breasts as she spoke, �And I guess I don't have to
worry about you losing interest in the new bigger and better me after that
display just now.�


 


����������� �So does
that mean you'll be asking our boarder for another fill up next time she's
looking to lose some weight?� I asked.


 


����������� �Jeez, you
never quit,� Joanna said, before staring down at her bust soberly, �I don't
know.� On one hand, sex at this size is
absolutely fucking incredible, on the other, I already feel like I'm going to
have trouble going out in public without causing a scene- can you imagine me
trying to go out and run errands with another twenty pounds of boobs jiggling
around in my sweater?� Wait, stop, I'm
sure you are now.� I mean, just being
this big I already so- I don't know- heavy; my back is sore, and I'm sure I'll
grow to hate feeling my thighs rubbing against each other in the
summertime.� I'm just not sure I'm ready
to put up with all the inconveniences of being so- you know- big.�


 


����������� �Well, it's
your figure, so it's not like I get a vote,� I admitted, �But depending on how
Reyna feels, you might not get one either.�


 


����������� �Right,
right,� Joanna sighed, �If she really wants to keep blowing me up like a
balloon, I can't really force her to stop without getting us in all kinds of
trouble.� But maybe she'll lose interest
in pumping me up until I'm like, four hundred pounds or whatever.�


 


����������� �Yeah,
that's true,� I said, reaching across the table and squeezing her arm, �Beyond
that, she seems determined to show you how thankful she is for the room and
since last night she made your boobs bigger and then this morning you asked her
for a second round.� She might be a
little strange, but I bet she thinks that so far you've really enjoyed her, ah,
displays of gratitude.�


 


����������� �Damn,
you're right,� Joanna said resignedly, suddenly going pale, �She probably
thinks I can't get enough of her filling me up.�
That's it then, there's no helping it- either we create an
international- maybe intergalactic- incident with me telling her to knock it
off, or I just need to get used to the fact that if she's here more than a
couple weeks, I'll be lucky if my tits aren't pumped so full they're liable to
burst!�


 


����������� �Hey now,
it doesn't need to be that way,� I said, hoping I sounded confident, �She just
left like, half an hour ago, and probably won't be back until this
evening.� We've got all day to think of a
way out of this.�


 


����������� �That's
true, and even if it takes us a day or two to work it out, she probably won't
blow me up as big as a parade balloon all at once tonight, so it's not really a

I lie down for a few hours and get some rest.�
If I'm not up by two, come get me, okay?�

and staggered up the stairs, one hand planted firmly against the small of her
back as she climbed, her voluptuous rear wobbling hypnotically with her every
step.� I had no idea what to do next.
