CHAPTER VIII 
 

“My Lovers Box” 
 

Natalie dropped Matt off at his house and arrived home at just before 4:30 that 

 
Sunday afternoon. She was still rolling Matt’s idea around in her mind. An energy 
dump like Matt had described was a good idea. It would better maintain her ability to 
conform to at least the extreme fringes of physiological norms. But the prospect of it 
was just as he described; worrisome. 
 
First and foremost, her stored power was a hedge against lean times. Subsisting 
as she did on the life energies of mortals, her current stores could sustain her for a very 
long time, well over a year, even at her current generous levels of use. If she “tightened 
her belt,” it could last considerably longer. Then there was the use of her powers for 
protection. Just as her current energy levels could sustain her life for a long time, in 
combat, they would be burned rapidly to produce powerful and effective defensive and 
offensive capabilities. Theoretically, she could dump all her energy into one single 
attack of monumental power, but in so doing would make herself terribly vulnerable. 
This will help us mainstream, and might even make us harder to track down, Superego 
 
piped up. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
raspberries. 
 
“I wonder if my gym membership is still current?” Natalie asked herself 
rhetorically. Twenty minutes later she was wearing a pair of workout shorts and a T-
shirt, both of which looked painted on, and on her way to the her gym. 
 
she was going to dump energy, particularly as much as would be required to return to a 
32M bra, it would mean drastically changing ten to fifteen people, or making more 
subtle changes to ten times that number. Being that this was a gym, she did a quick 
walk around to determine what the average attendee’s goals were and was rewarded 
with the predictable result. Most of them just wanted to get stronger, and look better in 
doing so. This should be easy enough. 
 

But I like this power, it makes us feel amazing! Id retorted. 
So we compromise… Biggest conventional bra size Georgia makes, Ego advised. 
NO! I don’t wanna! Id whined. 
That’s a compromise? Superego asked incredulously. 
Grow up, both of you! Ego chastised both of them. 
As if to emphasize Ego’s point, both Id and Superego responded with wet 

Arriving, she first tried to think about ways to affect the most people at once. If 

Natalie's first stop was the weight room. Calling it a room was kind of a 

 

 

On a flat bench was a young man in nearly knee length nylon mesh shorts and a 

"Oui... I mean yes," he stammered as he took in the visage above him, catching 

misnomer though, as it was a massive open bay of weight benches and sleds intended 
to aid the purists in gaining strength and packing on slabs of muscle. Or at least that's 
what the hard core residents of the church of iron would have had her believe. There 
were a few of them; hulking side's of beef with legs, but she was far more interested in 
the other, more numerous potential beneficiaries of her power; the many ordinary 
people struggling to add mass to thin bodies or remove it from fat ones. A quick mental 
appraisal of the people inside followed by a coinciding visual check revealed her perfect 
test case, and she steered her way around racks of weights and leverage machines 
toward him. 
 
distressed black t-shirt with a University of Washington Husky logo, who was trying 
very hard to psych himself up to bench press far too heavy a weight. He was thin with a 
pale complexion and a curly head of brown hair that fell in casual ringlets framing big 
blue eyes and an almost effeminate face that would make a healthy percentage of 
women find him quite attractive. Still, the 155 pounds he had on the bar above his head 
was easily greater than his lanky body weight. 
 
She stopped with her thighs almost straddling his head, her cantilevered breasts 
eclipsing her face from his view until she bent at her hips and looked over them into his 
eyes, "Do you need a spot sweetie?" 
 
what aparently his native tongue and switching to French accented English. 
 
on the bar in an over-under grip, "accidentally" touching his left hand with hers and 
rounding out her picture of his desires, and why he was obviously so far out of his 
comfort zone. 
 
and an American business woman's one night stand when she was on her graduation 
vacation seventeen years prior. Both of his parents were well off, but they were 
divorced and he was spending the summer with his mother. But as to why he was in 
the gym the answer was simple, a girl. Jenna- an athletic girl a year or so older than 
him, who always seemed to be coming from or going to the gym. He’d had his eyes on 
her for the last three years, though right now thoughts of her seemed to be obscured by 
trying to impress Natalie... how cute. 
 
meaning to her words and the fact that agreement would be, in a sense, consent. 
 
brought the weights to the ready position in a wobbly and halting display of more 
determination than actual control. If Natalie weren't there, he would have undoubtedly 
hurt himself, or at least dropped the bar, sending it flying dangerously across the bench 
to his left or right after shedding half its weight. Still, she did nothing to dissuade him.  

And he has an accent. The girls will really love him She placed her hands inside his 

His name was Jean-Claude LaCroix, and he was the product of a Parisian dentist 

"Well let's see what we can do?" she encouraged, inwardly pleased at the double 

"Yes," he agreed, straining to raise the bar from its rests above him. Slowly he 

 

 

As soon as his elbows unlocked his arms buckled, threatening to send the weight 

"That’s one, you can do more!" Natalie announced with saccharine 

He heaved up and his dead arms started raising the bar again, straining, but 

crashing down onto his chest, though Natalie effortlessly prevented him from 
experiencing that, instead making his arms engage at maximum effort all the way 
down. He gritted his teeth as the weight reached his chest and he struggled against the 
mass, slowly with Natalie's help bringing it inch by inch back up to the rest position. 
Sweat was pouring from his face after this single rep as he locked out his elbows again. 
 
encouragement. 
 
Again, he gritted his teeth as his elbows unlocked and his arms, now almost 
useless gave out beneath the overbearing mass. This time though he felt a twinge of 
pain seem to spread from his left hand and down his arm to where it diffused into his 
body. It made him take pause for a moment when the weight was back down against 
his chest. Time slowed for him as he looked up at the huge breasts of the unknown 
spotter above him. He saw a drop of sweat slowly tracing a path down her long neck, 
disappearing momentarily behind the contour of her clavicle before reappearing and 
starting it's long slow journey down toward the chasm of her cleavage where it 
vanished for the last time, lost in the bottomless depths there in. 
 
shockingly to him still putting effort into the movement. 
"Two! Keep going!" 
 
 
He lowered the bar again, sure now that the sexpot spotting him must be doing 
all the work, but determined to keep playing at the charade. The bar hit his chest again, 
but as he grunted in effort he felt it move upward again, not even resting against his 
ribcage this time as it rose steadily upward. 
"Three, you've got this!" she cheered. 
 
 
What the lad couldn't see were the changes he was undergoing as he lifted the 
weight again and again. His arms weren't scrawny now, but decently developed and 
swelling quickly as he did roughly half the work on his fourth rep. His chest filled out 
with pecs belonging to someone his age who spent several hours a week lifting by the 
fifth pass. By the sixth rep he was doing all the work himself, her hands only lightly 
touching the bar, and by extension ever so slightly his hand. 
 
from a lanky five foot seven to a stocky five feet ten with a body that looked like it 
could have been hewn from living stone. Now it was time for her to have some fun. 
 
he felt that underlying low intensity current that had been diffused throughout his 
body seem to flow down, focusing and concentrating in his crotch. He felt another 
sensation flooding his consciousness, very similar to arousal but different… better. He 
wasn’t just getting a hard on, he was getting bigger. 
 

As Jean-Claude began his eighth repetition of what now seemed a light weight, 

Natalie watched as his concentration was divided further from lifting the weight 

By rep seven she was pretty satisfied with his physique, having transformed him 

 

 

His breathing became labored as he started on rep ten, as his body underwent a 

"I knew 155 was too light for you." she announced. 
Jean-Claude looked confused for a moment before he nodded. "Ya... yes, it's just 

above his body, the mesmerizing massive breasts covered in a glossy sheen of sweat 
above it, and now the awkward sensation snaking its way down his left trouser leg. He 
started on his ninth rep and she watched with a smirk as the crotch region of his shorts 
bulged outwards as his balls surged larger, suddenly making up for lost time as they 
maintained some modicum of proportionality. Still his tool distended longer and fatter 
down his thigh, nearing the point where it would expose itself out the right leg hole of 
his shorts. 
 
final frenzy of changes. His physique swelled slightly more, chiseled definition 
emerging along his body and rapidly spreading down along his arms and legs. She 
tweaked his hormone production and metabolism to help him maintain his new body 
with a bare minimum of effort, while making physical exertion an enjoyable, wholly 
pleasurable and borderline erotic experience for his brain. Finally, as he finished raising 
the bar for the tenth and final time she stopped his cock’s expansion just as it was 
starting to emerge from the bottom of his right leg hole. With a clank she helped him 
rack the bar and let go, severing the link she shared with him. 
 
 
a warm up." He cast a glance at her nearly foot of visible delecotage but then past it 
toward a pull up bar against the far side of the room. 
 
before stepping off.  
She quickly followed his gaze as she moved away, So that's Jenna 
 
 
She started toward the woman who was methodically doing pull-ups with 15 
pounds of weight hanging from a belt between her legs. Jenna didn't need help from 
Natalie in the muscle department; she was jacked. She wore a black and pink sports bra 
and matching leggings that left none of her body in question. Right now, though, the 
focus was on her broad back, strong shoulders and arms, as well as her killer butt which 
was dramatically accented by the contrasting hot pink and black stretch fabric. In her 
ears were a pair of ear buds, the cords of which peaked out from her sandy blonde hair. 
Natalie decided on a course of action and subtly softened her own well-toned body 
down to a shape lacking any definition at all, having the consequence of fluffing up her 
already outrageously padded curves. Her sports bra creaked ominously as cleavage 
deepened further with the dense muscle fading into considerably more adipose tissue. 
She finished her set of pull ups and unchained the weights from the kidney belt 
 
before lowering them to the floor. She turned around to see Natalie looking sheepishly 
at her. She pulled the ear bud from her right ear. 
 
succubus' outrageous curves. 
 

"Well I need to go. Keep lifting." she encouraged, clapping him on the shoulder 

"Hi. I’m, uh, just starting to work out and I was wondering if you could, umm, 

"Can I help you?" she said neutrally, while casting a skeptical glance at the 

 

 

Jenna took the hand with a still suspect look and gave a firm handshake, one that 

give me any pointers? You seem like a good person to ask." Natalie made a special 
effort to sound unsure of herself, something not in her normal nature. 
"Uh huh," Jenna replied not buying the line Natalie was selling.  
 
I have to admit, I probably look like extreme casting for a porn flick. 
 
 
"The only way to lose this is to work it off or cut it off, and I am not having 
surgery," Natalie announced extending her hand to the young woman. "I'm Natalie." 
 
might have been slightly uncomfortable had she been mortal. "I'm Jenna. Jenna 
Anderson." 
The first thing that Natalie got from the touch was that Jean-Claude was 
 
screwed. Jenna's bread wasn't buttered on that side. Next and somewhat surprising was 
that Jenna didn't really feel insecure about her body. Sure, she wanted to be bigger, but 
mostly just by enhancing her musculature. In that regard, she wanted to be huge. She 
was obsessed with getting big, to the point it had ended two of her previous 
relationships. Jenna wanted to be one of those muscle-mag girls that either scared or 
creeped out most folks but caused envy, desire and admiration in the rest. She wanted 
to go as far as she could clean, but wasn't opposed to androgenic assistance if she 
needed it in the future. Still she was concerned about the masculine side effects of 
steroids. Jenna wasn't there yet, waiting to cross that bridge when she got to it. Of 
course, Natalie could help her along.  
 
release she'd given Jean-Claude it nearly took the late teen out at the knees, forcing her 
to steady herself with her hands above her kneecaps as she recovered from the shock. 
 
 
"Yeah, that was really strange. So, what did you want to work on first? I would honestly 
recommend starting with bodyweight exercises. The body is designed to lift itself. Stuff 
like push-ups, sit-ups, squats, calf raises, and pull ups. There are others too." she said, 
going into a monologue about the virtues of bodyweight movements for new weight 
lifters. Natalie took it in, but was really more entertained by the changes that Jenna was 
oblivious too. 
 
having a rapid effect. Her shoulders swelled first, going from big to massive; followed 
by her lats which bulged out from the sides her ribcage creating a broad "V" shape. Her 
upper arm muscles expanded into a great ball like bicep and rolling lumps of shredded 
muscle replaced her triceps. Her forearms too expanded, until they rivaled softballs at 
their thickest points before tapering into her still dainty if heavily calloused hands.  
 
begged to do bench work. Jenna's already sculpted 8-pack abs became a poster of her 
apparent dedication, with great furrows delineating each perfect swollen cobble 

"Are you okay?" Natalie asked with fake naïveté.  
Jenna shook her head to clear it as she stood back up, already two inches taller. 

The jolt that she gave Jenna was just that, a jolt. Far from the slow but steady 

Her body was already tight, but the juice Natalie had pumped into her was 

Her chest too expanded, as her pectorals grew into thick plates of flesh that 

 

 

Finally the teen titan's legs became monumental columns of female strength, 

surrounding the front and flanks of her midsection. Her waist line shrank down too 
though, not having had the bulking effect on her organs that many steroid and HGH 
users experienced resulting in a tiny circumference. It also let her hips flare into 
mountainous glutes that protruded behind her like a homing beacon for ass men, as 
long as they liked their butts strong. 
 
thick and corded with muscle. Each thigh was easily larger around than her waist; all of 
the half dozen individual muscles of her quads and hamstrings bulging outwards from 
her femur with incredible definition. And while her knees weren't outwardly affected 
Natalie saw to it that all her joints, particularly her knees and ankles, were strengthened 
to withstand the rigors that her new body would subject them to. That left her calves to 
surge into big chunky blocks of smooth flesh that contorted with every minor move of 
her legs. 
 
be mistaken for a man, even if she was built more like one now in many ways, so she’d 
endeavored in that moment of contact to add a few undoubtedly female touches. She 
made the girls hair shine and gave it a natural spiral curl, thickening it to twice the 
number of follicles and predisposing it to grow at twice the normal speed. She softened 
a little of the facial muscle definition, and made it less inclined to add mass in her jaw 
line and cheeks while still retaining its strength. Natalie made sure Jenna kept distinctly 
wide, womanly hips giving their curves a bit of padding that, like it or not Jenna 
wouldn’t be able to burn off, ensuring a distinctly feminine figure that was further 
exaggerated by the sweeping contour of her over-muscled thighs.  

The finishing touches though were the femininity. Natalie didn't want Jenna to 

Last but not least, there were boobs. Jenna didn't want big boobs, but she did 
regret the loss of her boobs when she started really exercising hard. So Natalie gave 
them back, swelling out a pair of C-cups before expanding them just a bit further to 
offset some of her newly more masculine frame while reprogramming her body to 
never pull fat from them again. 
The end of all this was Jenna had become a muscle goddess. She could give the 
 
strongest men in this room a good run for their money now, easily besting them with 
her legs and core, and maybe even in upper body strength. Natalie had created a gentle 
monster, but one who no one would ever accuse of not being a woman, and would 
never need to take anything to keep her gains or even continue to make new ones. 
 
completely oblivious to the changed that seemed completely natural. 
 
I think I’m just predisposed to being a bit fluffier than you. Thanks," she said offering 
her hand again. They shook, and Natalie couldn’t resist adding just a bit more volume 
to the girl’s breasts, swelling them to noticeable coconut sized DDs. It took all her 
willpower not to grow them further. 

"No, I think you've been helpful. I don't know if I will ever get to where you are. 

"- Do you have any other questions?" Jenna finished with her explanations, still 

 

 

Walking out on the pool deck, all eyes were on her. In many ways, her body 

"If you work hard, you can accomplish anything." Jenna added as they shook 

Leaving the gym for the neighboring sports store it took her the better part of an 

"You’re not her type sweetie," she said in passing with a sad lilt. 
He looked at Natalie who didn't turn around to explain before hanging his head. 
Leaving the weight room she did a quick self assessment, and quickly found 

 
before looking puzzled at both her too-tight sports bra and the meager fifteen pounds 
she'd been lifting in her pull-ups moments before.  
Natalie walked off, leaving Jenna standing confused and in a bra and shorts that 
 
were testing the design limits of spandex. She retightened her body before walking past 
Jean-Claude again as she headed out of the weight room, who was staring openly in 
lust now at the newly ultra-muscular target of his affection. 
 
 
 
she'd put hardly a dent into her reserves. She needed a conduit though to distribute her 
power more efficiently, something that everyone used, not just individuals. Her 
solution showed itself in the pool. People swam in the pool all day and as long as she 
was in it she could just dump her energy into the water and exposure would do the rest. 
She’d need a swimsuit though. 
 
hour to find a one piece that would fit her. By the time she’d returned it was getting 
close to the pool’s closing time. Still, she wanted to try it out. 
 
resembled that of a swimmer; the strong legs, powerful arms, broad back and 
shoulders, even her coke bottle figure. But there were two very large hydrodynamic 
drag inducing objects that made it obvious that swimming wasn’t her primary means of 
employ. The one piece she wore smashed her boobs into cavernously deep cleavage, 
and the straps of the suit cut deeply into the soft tissue, all the while mushing great 
bulging crescents of creamy sweater meat out the neck and arm holes. Additionally, her 
ass had unapologetically devoured the backside the suit. Finally, she’d had to be very 
careful when putting the suit on to keep it from settling into her lower lips and forming 
a highly visible camel toe. 
Even as tight as the suit was, when she jumped into the shallows and landed in 
 
the three foot deep water, her bosom careened about, threatening to pop the stitching. 
Finally in the pool, she started swimming, and as she did, started discharging her 
celestial essence into the clear waters. 
 
minutes, while Natalie tirelessly swam various strokes, other members of the pool’s 
current population of 13 started to change. The six 60-70 year olds grew younger and 
more toned, their wrinkles fading. The hugely obese black man who was making a 
disturbing mockery of water aerobics mysteriously began the process of shedding over 
200 pounds of fat and excess skin. The two men swimming in the lanes on either side of 
her got stronger and faster, the definition of their muscles more pronounced. Then there 
was the young woman in the far lane, who was already a phenomenal swimmer. Her 

To the unknowing eye, the changes wouldn’t be obvious, but over the next thirty 

 

 

body became like a blade through the water for the power and speed with which she 
sliced through it. 
 
The pool closed and the improved bodies extricated themselves from its 
revitalizing water, with Natalie finishing her lap to be the last one out. She noted with a 
mix of satisfaction and disappointment that her suit now fit better.  
 
 
goers, in their now ill-fitting swimwear, including one “seventy” year old who now 
looked more like an early forty year old, who’s suit was causing her much 
embarrassment where it was so baggy that it left little or nothing to the imagination in 
places.  

“Well finally, that’s a start,” she said to herself as she went to the shower. 
In the locker room there were was a mix of people. Some were her fellow pool 

Feeling she needed to correct this she lightly brushed past the former poster 

woman for AARP while she was at one of the sinks. The woman jumped with surprise 
at the exchange, and gave Natalie a funny look as she took her place at the adjacent sink 
with no acknowledgement of the exchange.  

Then the succubus watched, admiring with satisfaction as her magic did its 

work. Knowing now that Grace as the woman was named, had been dancer and 
swimmer when she was younger, Natalie had directed energies toward those area’s 
supportive of her pastimes, while adding her own personal touches. Already much 
younger looking than she’d been when she got into the pool, the woman regressed 
slightly more in age, any remaining crow’s feet and laugh lines fading completely. This 
wasn’t the end goal, just a bonus though and as that comparatively minor change 
ended, and the more significant ones began. 

Grace began to put on muscle mass, starting in her shoulders and arms, then 
proceeding down in a procedural way, though her chest and flanks, with pectorals 
thickening and her lats broadening to allow for the classic swimmer’s inverted triangle 
shaped upper body. Her waist didn’t shrink much, but it tightened up significantly, as 
her abdomen became a series of washboard bumps, and her obliques became distinct 
from her upper torso. 

Following the change down, her still rather uninspiring posterior began to 

expand, filling out more and more of the suits baggy bottom. Soon it had filled all the 
room her formerly seventy two year old, pear shaped overweight bottom had occupied 
when the suit had fit in the pool. The difference was that first off, her bottom was still 
growing, and second that it was a muscular triumph that would give some of the best 
twerkers a run for their money.  

Those changes continued to run south, as her hips filled out and paired up with 

rapidly thickening legs, legs that belonged to a professional dancer come world class 
swimmer hybrid. They were lean, powerful and sexy when that phase of the change 
stopped. As she stood there now, Grace had gone from a soft formerly seventy 
something to a more youthful soft early fifty something, and now to a chiseled early-

 

 

forties athlete. But the changes weren’t done. 

The rock hard muscle tone started to soften next, as a pleasant layer of fat began 
to roll up her body from her feet. It took the hard edges off the definition in her calves 
and thighs while leaving gentle impressions of feminine strength visible. Then it hit her 
ass, and it was an ass now. Any remaining spare space in the bottom of the one piece 
she wore was gone quickly as more and more volume inflated her green Speedo. The 
growth there stopped just as the stitching in the crotch and above the hips began to 
groan in protest. 

Very little changed in her core, a slight softening of the cobblestones that were 

her abs and flanks before the softening effect hit its area of greatest emphasis. Grace 
visibly swooned as her breasts began to inflate inside the once baggy swimwear. Her 
nipples hardened into points, indenting the stressed stretch fabric with their presence as 
they lead the way for her amplifying bosom. It flew through bra sizes, going from broad 
pancake flat masses and pressing outward. When they were about the depth of a decent 
sized grapefruit and fighting against each other for room, there was a series of muffled 
pops from the crotch of her suit and a familiar groaning at the seam below her arms. 
Still those now magnificent mammaries expanded further, until there was a sizable pair 
of bulges and a deep chasm of cleavage pushing out the neckline of the suit. 

Then like that the expansion stopped with her overburdened Speedo struggling 

between her greatly expanded ass and her now outsized pulchritude. The softening 
effect finally moved to her shoulders and then down her arms, making them feminine, 
but still undoubtedly strong. The net effect though was that the overmatched suit 
finally had too much, and in an instant there was a loud ripping series of pops as the 
stitching down one side of the suit gave way exposing one whole flank of her body. 
That was the moment that snapped Grace from her enrapt trance, as the leg arm hole on 
her left side became one. 

She let out a yelp of surprise and fled from the sink toward her locker at a run, 
her right arm struggling to hold her now much expanded boob firmly in check within 
the remains of the suit.

Natalie returned to work on Monday with a bounce in her step, one that made 
everything move accordingly. She was wearing a cream colored jacket and just above 
the knee skirt with dark nylons with candy-cane lighter strips that twisted around along 
with a thin black seam that ran up the back. Her four inch stilettos matched in cream 
with black accents. A silver satin blouse finished off the monochromatic look, while 
allowing her red hair and lipstick and luminous green eyes to add color.

By the end of lunch work was moving along smoothly, when Natalie got a knock

Bryce popped his head in the door, she saw that her secretary wasn’t at her desk.

Sitting again, she beckoned her to a chair. “What can I do for you?”

does it feel to have your own office?”

“No. Is she not in her office?” 
 
“Well that’s just it. Nobody’s seen her since your promotion. You were the last 
person anyone can remember talking to her. I know that you two haven’t always seen 
eye to eye, but it seemed to me like you’d buried the hatchet after you made partner. So 
I was wondering. Nancy in HR says that she’s not been in since that day either.” 
“Wow, no, I hadn’t heard. If I find anything out I will let you know.” 
 
“I am sure you will,” he said standing up, then wincing when Natalie did the 
 
same. “Oh, one more thing,” he said about two feet from the door. 
“What’s that?” 
 
“Where did you find your secretary?” Allan asked. 
 
“Cecelia? It was just lucky,” she deflected. 
 
 
“Huh, Nancy said that she didn’t remember seeing any applications come 
through for the position except hers. We understand that as a Partner, you are entitled

Kelli Smith's eyes fluttered open, the effects of the drugs keeping her panic 

Again, forcing her head to move, she looked again, this time to the right. There

she'd only had one meal, she surmised that it hadn't been that long. Willing her head to 
turn left she saw one of the other young women... Sasha? The black girl. Kelli 
remembered talking to her and another girl, Sadie briefly the last time she was 
conscious. 
 
was another woman there, one she didn't recognize, but like Sasha, she was laying 
supine on the floor naked. The new woman wore a bronzed complexion, with short 
cropped blonde hair that still had some kind of spiking product in it, and a very strong 
physique that both repulsed and at the same time made Kelli stare.  Her arms alone 
looked nearly as big around as Kelli's thighs. 
 
given wearing off, and as it did, she became aware of more. 
 
There were wrought iron candelabrums in the corners of the room with mostly melted 
candles providing the illumination. If there were windows she didn't see them, but 
there were heavy curtains that were either brown or red that could have been covering 
them. There was a single door on the opposing wall from the curtains, but if there was 
something beyond that door, nothing showed at the bottom. 
The young girl realized then that she too, was naked. While it hadn't occurred to 
 
her before, she suddenly felt embarrassed. Her arms still weren't working right though, 
and she couldn't move them to cover herself. She tried to speak, but her mouth barely 

She could feel her body waking up, the effect of whatever sedative she'd been 

The room she and the other women were in was perhaps twenty feet square. 

 

 

Four men, all young and in very good shape, and again, all nude entered the 

Kelli didn't know the woman's name, but she was the one who'd brought her

though, because there was suddenly noise coming from the far side of the door. It 
opened and she saw her.  
 
here, who'd brought all of them here, and she didn't understand how the woman had 
done it. The whole process of her arrival was foggy, but she knew that this woman was 
responsible. 
 
The woman had brown hair that was only present on her head, the rest was 
either shaved or more likely lasered off, as there was no stubble on her completely 
naked body. But it was what she held in her hand and indeed what followed that made 
Kelli reflexively gasp. 
 
room. All of them had hoods over their heads and their hands bound with a rope that 
the woman held in her hands as a lead. They also had one other thing in common; all of 
them had straining erections. The woman led them in and around the women, who it 
now appeared to be arranged around the room in wide circle, their feet facing to the 
center. The men were laid down inside the circle formed by the girls, their feet just 
opposite those of the girls, so that the men’s heads pointed inwards with about a four 
foot circular gap in the middle. It was also quickly clear that there was a fourth girl, 
probably Sadie on the opposite side of the circle from her, down past her feet.

No worries, that won't be a problem soon," the captor announced with an almost 
mirthful lyrical lilt. Those were the first words Kelli had heard her say and it wasn't 
comforting. 
 
breasts, she was probably ever so slightly too well endowed about the hips and breasts 
to be a fashion model and her hair was too long, falling in luxurious waves and curls to 
the back of her thighs. The rich brown looked out of place on her tanned body, as 
though the sun had never touched it. It added an exotic quality to her otherwise 
European features. 
 
She turned away from Kelli, and moved to the edge of the room above her field 
of view, coming back to the circle a moment later with a wicked looking black bladed 
knife. The blade was intricately etched she could see, even in the rather poor candle 
light, and the edge drew out into a long twisting tip, terminating in a very fine point. 
She held something else in her other hand, but Kelli couldn't quite make out what it 
was.

She managed to follow the woman with her eyes as she walked first to the man

The woman was undeniably attractive. Tall, with willowy limbs and generous 

As the woman walked past Kelli, she noticed the young woman's eyes were 

 

 

The woman walked past the women and into the space at their feet where she 

She stood over each man, making a quick symbol upon each of their foreheads 

Kelli couldn't look away from the man positioned closest to Sasha. He had, in her 

something and then made an almost effortless slice into the man's outer thigh, 
producing a profuse fountain of blood that momentarily gushed forth. It was then that 
she realized what the woman held in her other hand; a small bronze bowl, into which 
she collected a small portion of his bloody outflow. The woman repeated the deft slice 
on all the men, each time with the uncharacteristically great initial outflow of blood of 
which she collected a sample in the small bowl. 
 
began to make an intricate symbol upon the ground with the bloody contents, using her 
fingers as brushes and working quickly. In just a few minutes she was done, and she 
stepped purposely from the symbols and moved back to the men, who still lay 
strangely still, save their straining hard-ons that visibly pulsed with their heartbeats. 
Their bloody wounds had stopped bleeding, a far cry from the practical fountains that 
had gushed when she’d cut them initially.

growling voice. To Kelli it sounded like gibberish, like made up babbling, but there was 
no deigning something was happening. The men started moaning in unison, their cocks 
surging as they thrust into the air again and again.

his already irrepressible member was now growing rapidly before her eyes. He'd been 
pretty big when he'd been led in, but now, even in her inexperienced opinion he was 
massive, and rapidly becoming immense! 
 
adding more at the end. The men's now huge tools stopped growing near arm length. 
Impossibly big. But new growth started, and their balls began to swell. They bloated

comprehension, but through it all the most she could do was hyperventilate wide eyed. 
 
Then the woman in the center of the circle started chanting again. She made a lap 
around the room, stopping to mark each girl’s belly with a bloody mark. She reached 
Kelli last, smiling gleefully as she painted a bloody symbol upon Kelli’s belly. Kelly 
winced and then whined, as the warm blood initially seemed to burn her, only for the 
burning to change into a disturbingly pleasant glowing warmth. Then the world 
seemed to pull back, and the only things in the world were the chanting beauty in the 
center of them, and the women around her. Even the men and their grotesque packages 
were gone, replaced by a smothering blackness. Kelli watched the woman as she 
continued to chant louder and louder, her voice seeming to drive into her soul. Then 
she dumped the remaining blood from the bowl over herself and she too vanished and 

The woman was chanting again, repeating the initial stream of gobbledygook but 

Kelli looked on in terror as the young man's organs swell beyond 

 

 

That grip was brutally painful and Kelli finally mustered something more than a 

Suddenly there was something sinister she could feel, drifting languidly over her 

Who are you?!? Kelli thought. 
You are very clever. Most people try to talk with their voice... But it really doesn't matter

body. It was darker than the blackness that surrounded her, and it swirled across her 
skin, dragging invisible icy fingertips. Her skin tightened into gooseflesh as those 
freezing tendrils crossed her venus mons and traced up her stomach. Kelli gasped as the 
fingers dragged over her nipples, and when her mouth opened those invisible frigid 
digits shot to her lips, and grabbed onto her jaws with strength like steel. 
 
wheezing groan, instead uttering a guttural scream as a horribly beautiful face 
suddenly loomed over her, inhumanly black and terrifying and mesmerizingly sublime. 
It seemed to hover over her for an eternity before its perfect lips parted in a smile filled 
with malevolence, self-assurance and eagerness. 
Then that brutal, bitter cold pushed into her unprepared pussy, making her 
 
breath catch and in that gasping inhale, the face dissolved into dust and flowed into her, 
filling her whole body with that unbearable cold, and then ... she was back in the room. 
Hello child. The voice wasn't the woman in the center, the timber was too rich, too 
 
smooth and impossibly intimate. I am inside you Kelli... 
 
 
who I am, it won't matter in a few minutes. 
 
 
to not introduce myself. I am Lilith, queen among demons, and your precious body will suffice 
for now to become my new home. 
"But Jesus is my lord-" 
 
 
Jesus isn't here sweetheart. And while he may have your soul, I only need your body. He 
can have your soul when I am done. But since you are going to be that way... I will let you watch 
as I corrupt your body, and as a result, you mind. Then you will get to know what you never got 
to experience before your body is used up. Now, there’s a very well prepared man to help get you 
started on the path of being my vessel, but first I will feast on your fear as you witness what will 
soon happen to you. 
"But-" Kelli attempted to protest. 
 
 
Silence! Just watch… Lilith commanded and like that Kelli's face went 
momentarily blank. Then like waking from a bad dream the blackness around her 
parted. She blinked her eyes and sat up. Her heart was pounding from the nightmare 
she’d just had. Or was it? Looking around she was still in the dark candle-lit room with 
the others, still naked and still with a bloody mark painted on her belly. She pinched 
herself. She was wide awake now, all the drug induced drowsiness and paralysis gone 
from her body. She felt fine, good even, and yet a sense of anxiety and worry lingered in 
her gut. 
 

"What's going to happen in a few minutes?" 
You and I are going to become the same person. But I suppose if it would be a disservice 

Across from her, Sadie was sitting up. There was a dazed look on the girl’s face. 

 

 

Instantly a look of terror came over Sadie’s face and just as quickly vanished 

What happened next only heightened Kelli’s fear. As Sadie sucked the man’s 

“Sadie? Are you okay?” she asked. 
“Oh fuck, what the hell was that?” asked the other girl. To their sides the other 

 
 
two girls were also sitting up. 
 
again. 
 
“Oh god, Kelli! Something’s inside me! Something is…” her voice trailed off as 
her expression changed from fear and terror to a far scarier one of giddiness and lust. 
 
“Oh fuck Kelli, I feel so good, shit! Mmm,” she cooed as she ran her hands over 
her breasts, giving her nipples a flick. Kelli swore it looked like the girl’s breasts grew a 
little as she played with them. Her eyes flashed red as they focused on the man in front 
of her. 
 
“Food!” she exclaimed with an inhuman voice, lunging forwards and encircling 
the man’s shaft with her mouth. There was a horrible cracking as the girl’s jaw partially 
detached, like a serpent’s, to take the entirety of the massive phallus into her maw. Kelli 
clapped a hand over her mouth to stifle a scream of terror, but she couldn’t look away. 
 
cock her features began to change. Her breasts and ass began to grow larger, her hair 
longer and her fingernails grew out into sharp talons. Worse for Kelli, was that as she 
watched she realized that pleasant warmth she’d had in her belly was spreading to her 
loins, and that the more she watched this horrific scene the more it was turning her on! 
She found herself fighting back feelings she’d never felt so strongly; feelings of lust, 
desire and envy. She wanted to be where Sadie was, to fuck and be fucked. 
Laughter began to fill Kelli’s mind, not hers, but that of the voice from before. 
 
See? it cackled. I’ve barely done anything to you and already you’re being corrupted. 
 
No! shot back Kelli. No, I won’t give in, I’m pure; I have a strong will! 
 
The laughter raised in volume. We shall see about that. 
 
 
“I have to get out of here,” Kelli whispered to herself, as if saying it aloud would 
keep it secret from the voice in her head. She forced herself to turn away from the sight 
of Sadie, only to face Sasha crawling towards her on hands and knees. 
 
stop!” 
 
she saw creamy white fluid dripping from her mouth. 
 
 
woke up and I had this dude’s huge dick in my mouth! I freaked out and got away from 
him, but now I feel really weird.” As the girl talked a large glop of cum fell from her 
mouth and onto her hand, which Sasha picked up and licked clean without any obvious 
thought. There was a disturbing look of enjoyment on her face as she sucked up the 
gooey mess. Kelli couldn’t help but lick her own lips in hunger at the sight of the tasty 

“Sasha… are you okay? What’s that in your mouth?” 
“I, I was dreaming I was with my boyfriend, giving him a good time, but then I 

Kelli reached down to help the other girl, then stopped and pulled back when 

“Kelli…” moaned the black girl. “Help… me… oh God I’m so horny! Make it 

 

 

Kelli frantically scanned the room, looking for a way out. She tried to ignore the 

“Come on,” she said looking back to Sasha, “take my hand.”  
She noticed though that Sasha looked different than she had just moments ago.

“No!” she shouted to herself, trying to purge the vile thoughts, but they 
remained, and now her nose could smell the delicious scent of sex and cum beginning 
to permeate the chamber. Her stomach growled needily. 
 
sight of Sadie and the fourth very muscular girl fucking and sucking the two men 
they’d been given, tried to ignore the fact that both their bodies were expanding in 
strange, beautiful, and horrific ways. The woman who’d brought them here was 
standing idly by in the center, just watching. But she was making no move to stop Kelli 
and Sasha, and the door was just ten feet away. 
 
 
Her already bubbly black ass was swelling dramatically into a stripperific 
badadonkadonk butt. The girl’s mouth was open and she was drooling now, and her 
breasts hung noticeably lower from her chest. 
 
knowing look of hunger. Both their pussies were drooling now; and Sasha seemed 
transfixed on Kelli’s. Kelli couldn’t help but admit to herself that she needed some kind 
of release before she went anywhere. Just a little, then she’d be out of this dungeon. 
 
She is below us and will satiate our desire, if not our hunger. 
 
the black girl’s head with a cruel force Kelli never knew she possessed, and jamming 
Sasha’s face into her crotch. 

Yes, cooed the voice in her head. You demand to be served. We demand to be served. 

Kelli’s body mechanically walked toward Sasha, her arm shooting out, grabbing 

“Horny…” panted Sasha. She looked back up at Kelli and both girls exchanged a 

 “Thank you mistress,” mumbled Sasha as she began furiously tonguing Kelli 

and slurping up her feminine juices. Sasha, who unknown to Kelli had been bisexual to 
start, quickly brought Kelli to an orgasm which while pleasurable did nothing to sate 
the growing hunger in her belly. If anything it felt like Sasha had stolen a bit of her 
strength in the act. Anger and rage built inside Kelli, alien feelings to the perfect church 
girl. Again she grabbed Sasha’s head, this time violently flinging her aside, the black 
girl tumbling several feet from Kelli’s surprisingly strong throw.  

No! Stop it! she cried mentally. Why did hurting someone make her feel good? 

Please, don’t make me do these things!  

The voice in her head only laughed louder. Good, you’re becoming dominant. I am 
the Queen of all in this room, and you are my host. You have fed one of your subjects with your 
own limited energy, now, help her to the feast. 

“Kelli,” moaned Sasha from her prone position on the floor. The shock of being 

thrown down momentarily cleared her head. “Kelli help, please, look what’s 
happening.”  

Getting up Sasha found herself staring at what had been the muscular girl, who 

 

 

was now squatting overtop of her man and furiously pumping her body up and down 
atop his shaft. Her muscles had exploded into a grotesque scene that looked like the 
worst examples of female steroid abuse, while her belly was distended both by the cock 
within her and the amount of jism she’d taken in. Below her the young man now looked 
decidedly middle-aged, his skin pale, his life rapidly being sucked out by the beast atop 
him. She snarled at Sasha, causing the black girl to scream in fright and scramble 
backwards, only to trip over the man who’d been placed before Kelli. 

Look girl, she’s going to take your food, said Lillith’s voice. We can’t have that now, 

can we? 

Indeed, the hunger inside Kelli was becoming unbearable. She needed a man, 
and that was hers. She paced quickly back to Sasha, who was currently freaking out 
about the giant cock before her and the realization that her body was slowly changing 
like that of Sadie and the other girl. Fear commanded her to run yet lust and desire kept 
her staring straight at the cock before her. 

Kelli grabbed Sasha by the arm, breaking her trance.  
“Oh thank you,” said Sasha. “Now let’s go, before it’s too late.” 
But there was an evil look on Kelli’s face, a look of disdainful self-righteousness 

and sadic joy. Instead of helping her to her feet, Kelli merely shoved her back to the 
man whose dick she’d been unknowingly sucking just minutes ago. Several small 
puddles of jism were pooled on the man’s chest; his cock having spurted uncontrollably 
a few times since Sasha's unexpectedly strong willpower had let her make a temporary 
escape. Now, fully conscious and aware but infinitely hornier, Sasha found the sight 
hard to resist.  

“No….” she moaned, as her mouth gaped open. “Stop it! You can’t make me!” 

She was screaming; not at Kelli, not at the man or even the woman who’d captured 
them, but at no one in particular. Kelli surmised that she was battling her own laughing 
voice inside her head. 

Sasha’s tongue lolled out of her mouth, and she began cleaning up all the cum 

puddles from the man’s chest, her eyes beginning to tear as she went. 

“Ohhhh… no… mmmm… yes… no….” she was simultaneously weeping in 

terror and moaning in ecstasy now. As she did so, Kelli felt her body acting on its own 
accord. The sight of Sasha losing herself turned her on even more. She felt her fingers 
penetrate her own sex, giving in to self-pleasure, and as Sasha’s mouth worked its way 
up the man’s cock Kelli could hear her own moans of pleasure begin to mirror Sasha’s 
and those of their already far-gone co-prisoners.  
 
legs of the man behind her. 

Eyes still fixed on Sasha, Kelli's body moved mechanically to seat itself on the 

Her man had gone the longest without any form of stimulation, and the tip of his 

cock was oozing a white slick of precum from his over-filled genitals. 
 

“I’m a good pure girl,” she whispered to herself, even as she stared down the 

 

 

giant phallus before while her left hand continued stroking and playing with her own 
sex. The scent of his cock was tickled her nose. Her mouth fell open, her tongue came 
out. “God help me. I just need a little bit, just a taste, then I can run.” Inside her head 
Lillith was positively giddy with delight. 

“Yes,” she heard her mouth say as, though it was both herself and Lillith 
speaking now. “This will be delicious.” And with that she leaned forward and started to 
lick. 

“Mmm… so… good,” she moaned. As she fed, her consciousness seemed to be 
regressing in her mind; as if each evil act and bit of pleasure and drop of cum pushed 
her back into a corner of her head. It barely felt like she had control of her body 
anymore, like she was on auto-pilot, though she could still feel and enjoy every ounce 
of pleasure she was giving herself. It felt strangely good, freeing in a way, yet terrifying. 
With every plunge of her hands into her snatch and every suck on this man’s penis she 
seemed to have less and less control of her body. With dim awareness she could feel the 
weight of her breasts increasing. She brought her other hand up and began fondling her 
chest. Glancing for a moment past the cock before her she saw Sasha had completely 
lost herself; the girl’s mouth fully engulfing her man’s cock as her curves rapidly 
swelled. Kelli found herself deliriously jealous of the black girl’s huge breasts and butt. 

Doesn’t this feel wondrous dear? Asked Lillith. 
Yes… replied Kelli dreamily. 
Perfect. You’re such a good host. I’ll feed you all the pleasure and terror you could ever 

dream of, and then some. 

Yes, mmm… so good. More! No… no…wait, stop. STOP! Thought Kelli, her mind a 
mess of fear and pleasure. She realized she wasn’t even doing anything; her body was 
moving by itself. STOP! I’m stopping this! I’m leaving! She tried to scream, but no words 
came out, just thoughts. She tried as hard as she could to pull her tongue off the man’s 
cock, to stand up, push off, to run away. But she couldn’t. It was like she was a backseat 
passenger in her own body, trapped and paralyzed, able to perceive but not act.  I… I 
can’t! I can’t stop myself! Help! I can’t speak! HELP!!! 

 Lillith just laughed maniacally. 
 
Now Lillith, in full control of her body, commanded her mouth to open wide to 
fully take in the outsized view filling phallus that they’d been till now merely tongue-
bathing and sucking the tip of. Kelli felt an excruciating pain as her jaw dislocating and 
her throat was shredded by the giant cock pushing through her neck and into her chest 
before lodging its head at the entrance to her stomach. 
 
physical noise. 
It does? I think it feels wonderful, the power- I've not felt this in millennia, Lilith 
 
replied, her sensuous voice rolling over Kelli's consciousness like velvet. I think he needs 
to cum. 

"Dear lord God in heaven, it hurts!" Kelli screamed mentally, unable to utter any 

 

 

Instantly the sensation of the man's release inside her filled Kelli's world, as 

 
Lilith forced her camera view to float above the man with Kelli's mouth buried in his 
crotch, bent over and almost sandwiched between his massive balls awkwardly. To her 
horror, she saw those huge stones began rhythmically convulsing, shrinking and then 
growing again as Kelli's belly began to bloat. Quickly the man's body began to shrivel 
as his life was drawn into the two pulsating magical orbs that had been his testicles. 
Kelli was wailing terribly while Lilith began to laugh even as her midsection 
 
distended well beyond pregnancy and into a strange morbid obesity. Soon the man's 
body was a withered shadow of itself, barely supporting a heartbeat. Finally those 
hideous testicles began to shrink, smaller and smaller until they too were shriveled to 
the size of currants. Only then did the cock start to recede from its place in her throat, 
quickly retreating up her throat until it was a bone dry husk of leathery skin. All the 
while Kelli's midsection continued fatten, until finally the desiccated remains of the 
unnamed man flashed to powder and vanished leaving a faint layer of dust on the floor. 
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust Kelli. You just killed that man; his life is inside you right 
 
now. How does that make you feel? Lilith taunted even as Kelli lost it. Okay, you are boring 
me now. I think we are through. Besides, I can't be this slovenly cow. I am queen of the succubi, 
and this body is my new home. It needs to look the part. Good bye. 
 
And like that Kelli Smith, daddy’s good Christian girl, freshman in college who 
was saving herself for marriage, effectively ceased to exist. Her addled and maddened 
consciousness sealed up and banished to a dim corner of her mind where it would 
remain, comatose and in limbo, forever. 
In the blink of an eye, the excess flesh that had been the man retracted and 
 
reshaped into a svelte tight midsection as Lilith repositioned all of his undigested 
energy into her new form. Kelli's modest bosom shot through several cup-sizes  while 
as her already trim waistline tapered to what would be called waspish between her 
breasts and suddenly comely hips. Any blemishes she'd had as Kelli faded out as her 
pale skin blanched into cream. She rose from her knees and turned to face the bloody 
woman still standing silently in the center of the scrolling symbols.  
“Your majesties,” she said kneeling to the floor in reverence. 
 
 
“Rise, and state your name,” the queen with by far the most outrageous figure of 
the four of them said. She was Caucasian with the blackest of black hair that curled in 
long waves to nearly her ass and eyes so dark brown that they might as well have been 
black too. Contrasting this was the palest milk-white skin one could imagine. Her 
breasts protruded in complete defiance of gravity from a narrow ribcage coupled on top 
with thin shoulders and delicate arms, and was mated below by a tiny waist that 
expanded rapidly into wide hips and full womanly legs.

“An interesting choice of names,” Eisheth said. In contrast to Lilith’s milky out of

they were flecked with red and gold and graced with shimmering chestnut hair. She 
was tall, easily over six foot in her stocking feet. She had large breasts that were 
probably in the grapefruit size range, but it was her powerful musculature that grabbed 
the willowy human’s attention. She was a chiseled masterpiece of feminine muscularity. 
Every muscle she had stood out in definition as she moved, rippling as she breathed. 
“Have you provided clothes for us?” Naamah inquired. Her flesh was dark like 
 
bakers chocolate, but with bright blue eyes that made her strong facial features jump 
out in the dim light. She was as broad as Eisheth, but softer, with a ghetto booty, and 
tits that fell midway between Eisheth and Lilith’s in magnitude. Also of note was her 
large protruding clit that stood out against the black lips of her nether regions like a 
bright pink beacon.

evenly. She was Asian in facial features and skin tone, but with bright red hair. Her 
gun-slit lidded eyes were jade green, and her lips were bee stung, stained red and full, 
nearly to the extent of Naamah’s. Her body was easily the smallest, but strong without 
doubt, as her body was almost as defined as the much larger Eisheth. Pert, large orange 
sized breasts with golden brown puffy areola and nipples were placed high on her 
chest, giving the illusion of a very long waistline, and in turn made her generous hips 
look all the larger, along with her tight ass. Her legs were long, proportionally the 
longest of any of the women in the room and while she was tiny at under five feet, it 
was obvious that they were made for high heels.

her cleavage while the other covered her eyes as a wave of dizziness rolled over her. 
Then as quickly as it started, it stopped, and just like that Natalie knew someone or a 
group of someone’s from the other side had just arrived close by. And they were 
probably after her. 
 

“Are you okay?” Leyla asked, stooping down at Natalie’s side.

“Yeah, just a panic attack… I’ll be okay.” Natalie explained while dabbing her

“Yeah, I think I will,” Natalie admitted with a smile 
“Should I call 911?” Cee asked, phone in hand, as the elevator doors opened on 

Natalie shook her head no, and Cee put her phone away. 
Perfect, Natalie thought with a grimace, just what I need. 

Across the United States, Cianna was awakened by a young priest’s phone call. 
“Hello?” she answered groggily. She looked at the clock, Damn, just fell asleep too.

God himself. She’s is referenced in the Old Testament, the Talmud, the Torah, and even 
the Quran. Naamah was a demon who had sex with King David, and gave birth to 
Asmodeus, a prince of demons. Agrat Bat Mahlat and Eisheth Zenunim are more

will do is send another Soldier after me. No, he’s gone to the source. He’s sent a queen

Angela was ready. It had been several days since her departure from the firm 

 
following Natalie's promotion. She'd awoken knowing she needed to get back there, eat 
some crow, and try to keep her job. If for no other reason than she had nothing to wear 
that fit anymore and her bank account had been sucked dry over the past weeks blur of 
debauchery. There were no pictures of her before, but she was pretty sure now that 
something had changed.

amount of flesh which constituted the gravity defying breasts pulling her t-shirt to near 
its breaking point. She could button the jacket, as it fit easily around her waist, but her 
ta-ta's looked absolutely idiotic. She didn't even have a bra. 
 
Her nipples looked preposterous poking through the thin distressed cotton. She turned 
to see her profile and sure enough they were protruding visibly like pinky fingertips. 
Angela blew her bangs up in exasperation and lifted her t-shirt up, frowning with 
annoyance as she felt the heavy weight of her tits flop out from the shirts restraint. 
Taking out a package of Band-Aids, she made a ‘plus’ symbol with a pair of them across 
each offending nub. 

Pulling the shirt back down, she took another look at her reflection.  
Better. Not perfect, but better... good enough. 
She grabbed her purse and headed out the door.

"I am so glad you like it," the heavily made up and tattooed woman said while 

 
 
Lilith pulled the zipper up the thigh high boots that encased her legs. The latex 
rubber hugged her like a dark sausage casing over her alabaster skin. The deep purple 
mini-dress and black vinyl corset along with the black opera gloves and matching boots 
finalized her outfit, making her look legally indecent. Added to this outfit was the fact 
that she'd drained the life forces of four more men over the night; her ample curves 
becoming outrageous. This made the glossy outfit even more outlandish. She did a turn

something that a porn starlet would wear to the gym, albeit one who probably took a 
whole lot of steroids. Spandex short shorts that betrayed her sizable camel toe and an 
overmatched sports bra were the only clothes she needed, though a pair of ankle socks 
could be seen just above the most practical footwear of the four queens, in some 
expensive but common work out trainers. Her hair was impeccably styled in soft brown

floor as a car horn behind the van blared in irritation.

sweet on the outside even as it dripped with malice on the inside.

she’d been glamoured and hugely changed. 
 
 
behind her. Instantly she was crushed by an olfactory onslaught that made her nipples 
and clit stand at painful attention and her juices begin to flow, even as her knees got 
wobbly and her head lolled. She wasn’t the only one; the whole crowded sidewalk 
suddenly became a throng of desperately aroused humans. Those with the least 
willpower simply moved to the nearest person to them and began kissing, groping and 
undressing those within reach. Chaos ensued, and the four demons quickly used the 
orgy as cover to usher Angela out of the area of effect and into an alleyway. 
 

“Angela! Angela Martin!” she called in her rich voice like an old friend. 
The curvaceous lawyer turned about and saw the four bombshells standing right

“It would be a pleasure,” the Asian said moving up to Angela. Her lips went to 
the woman’s; learning everything she knew in an instant, and then she began to draw 
the energy out of her. The queen drew first on her natural energies, and then attempted 
to start in on what Natalie had endowed Angela with, but became perplexed when she 
couldn’t draw any forth. She kept trying for twenty seconds until it became apparent 
that nothing would come of it. Angry, she shoved the terrified woman hard into the 
wall with audible crunch of bone on concrete. 
 
she shrieked angrily 
 
“Let me try,” Lillith demanded, taking her place in front of the now broken 
Angela. With the smile of one who truly enjoys what she does, Lilith began her attempt 
at siphoning off the energy that Natalie had imbued Angela with. And again, the result 
was the same. Concentrating harder, to the point that she was now expending power in 
her attempt to unlock what Angela had left, she found no more success.

“What?” Matt asked, looking at her scrunched closed eyes. 
 
She’d been in the process of riding him to his second climax of the early evening 
 
when she stopped suddenly, and her hands had flown to her chest above her heart and 
she cringed. She remained locked like that for about two minutes when her hands 
slowly lowered and her eyes opened. 
 
“Another succubus, a very powerful one, just tried to steal power I’d bestowed 
onto someone. I’ve only heard of it being done before, never experienced it, but it felt 
just like I’ve heard; like someone driving red hot nails into your heart and then using 
them to tear it apart,” she described breathing hard, as sweaty beads formed all over

Cianna had dropped Marcus off at St. James and filed a report, which had been 

 
received and replied to with a stern rebuke. In return she’d flown off the handle and 
effectively bitched out a bishop. The end result of which was that nothing had changed. 
Marcus was a rambling vegetable and she was once again on Natalie’s case, neither of 
which really bothered her. Right here, in Seattle of all places, she was quite possibly 
going to be fighting the four queens. It was a prospect that excited her and scared her at 
the same time. They were some of the most powerful demons in hell, only they weren’t 
in hell. They were on Earth.

she’d saved her life. And showed her insight into the ways of the God and the universe.

Naamah strode up to the security checkpoint at Bryce, Fox and Barlowe in attire 
 
that pushed business wear to the slutty verge of pornographic. She’d left Lilith behind

changed nothing about her purpose. She was there to find her prey… and put an end to

“Naamah, something is bothering you. It’s been obvious since we arrived here,” 

“Nothing’s the matter,” she said uneasily. 
Lilith said nothing, but the glare that she cast upon the lesser queen was 

 
wrapped around her fingers. 
 
“No, that isn’t necessary. I will catch up with her sooner or later.” She said with a 
pasted on smile as she walked back out of the building. Inwardly she was fuming mad, 
but making a scene wouldn’t be beneficial to her mission. She arrived back at the 
blacked out limo where Lilith was waiting, a strapping 20 something young man seated 
naked across from her with a painfully erect and decidedly large cock throbbing with 
readiness.

“See. It wasn’t so hard to express your feelings to me,” Lilith announced 
reassuringly. Then quick as a switch being flipped, she had Naamah pinned to the floor 
of the limo, her considerable mammary bulk and outlandish figure crushing down on 
the black woman. “I am far older than you, and my methods aren’t to be questioned. 
This is our first opportunity to gain power in millennia and you want to accomplish the 
mission immediately, when you know we'll be recalled the instant Natalie is back in 
Hell? I think that your behavior is in conflict with your better personal interests!” 
 
Naamah was trying to resist the invisible waves of power that were rippling over 
her skin from Lilith’s crushing bulk. The immense weight of her preposterous form was 
of little real consequence for one as powerful as her, but that mass was magnified by 
Lilith’s far greater celestial power, aided further by the energies she’d been feasting 
upon since the four of them arrived here. And her demonic appetites were beyond 
insatiable. It was getting hard for her to think, and it felt like she couldn’t get her breath, 
which was odd since she didn’t really need to breathe. That’s when she realized that 
Lilith was draining her life energies right there on the floor of the limo. Darkness was 
closing in on the edges of her vision, and what she could see started to fade from color 
to grayscale. She’s going to do it! She’s going to siphon so much off of me that I’ve no choice 
but to return to Hell, a failure! What will Satan do to me…? 

“And…” 
“And I feel that you should spend less time gorging on sexual power and more

covering any brown in her irises. “My queen! I beg your mercy!” 
 
peals scrambling nearly every thought in her trapped queries’ panicking mind. 
“My faithful service must be worth-” she gasped in air, “something.” 
 
 
The crushing sensation eased for a moment as Lilith thought about what 
Namaah said. Then, in the blink of an eye, she was reclining back on the overburdened 
seat of the limousine. “Get off the floor, queen,” She added the title with heavily 
implied malice.

in which they are better than average. For a lot of them, it’s as simple as being extra

Really strong. Like bench- press a building strong. But that strength comes at a cost, 
she'll burn through her power really fast. That may be something we can use, but if 
she’s spent any significant time building reserves here, we will probably be out of luck 
there. 
 
“Naamah is an organizer. She’s always been very focused. She is a meticulous 
planner and commander. She doesn’t make mistakes except perhaps her superiority

where she loses her control. She has on several occasions that I know of developed a

the memories of those who’ve seen her so that they effectively, haven’t. Combined with 
a sharp mind and a balanced disposition, she’s the least likely to seek direct 
confrontation, but with her speed and ability to be forgotten, she could be a very 
difficult opponent. Of the queens, she’s the only one who I ever got along with.”

being at a time this way. She can drain demons too, just by contact, I mean any of us can 
derive sustenance from a demon if we make them orgasm, but she can do it through 
non-sexual touch. She’s brutally strong too. Like Eisheth but without the hulking 
musculature. She’s got all the dangerous abilities of the others, save maybe Agrat’s 
speed, plus her own twist. And unlike the rest of us, she can manage her mass. She 
doesn't have to look huge like the other queens, or even me, if we are storing large 
amounts of energy.

It was nearly lunch time when Eisheth and Agrat along with Malleus entered the 
 
safe house to find it full of nubile men and women in various states of dress. To call the 
mood in the large flat erotic would be an understatement and the two succubi had to 
work hard to keep themselves away from the writhing throngs of men and women as 
they worked their way back to Lilith’s room. Eisheth rapped on the door and waited. 
There was an uneasy lull before Lilith’s seductive voice beckoned them into the room. 
The three entered and bowed low before the reclining queen.

Lilith’s milky white skin almost glowed in the dim light, where it was visible 

“Malleus, it’s been so long since I’ve seen you in human form,” Lilith tittered 

“My queen,” he said in a gravelly grumble. 
“I thought that he could aid us. He had a run in with Nathalia barely a week 

“More than you!” Lilith taunted telepathically. 
Instantly Agrat’s guard was up. “We’ve been unsuccessful in our search, but

immense pulchritude. How many humans has she laid waste to already? We’ve barely been on

Lilith perked up at this, sitting up straight and sending her twin bed covering  
mammaries into a momentary quaking frenzy. As she sat up though, they compacted 
seamlessly into much more practical, though still improbable large size, and her inner 
glow intensified. The aura of unstoppable lust increased measurably, and her cloying 
pheromone smell made both lesser queen's swoon momentarily. On Malleus the effect 
was more obvious, as his huge member began snaking and swelling down the 
fortunately quite baggy leg of his trousers.  The look on her face was one of eagerness 
but something else as well… 
 
to hell. Lilith doesn’t want to go back to hell! No wonder she’s dragging her feet and draining as 
many humans as she can.

Lilith bellowed in her mind. 
 
 
Malleus responded.

perfect likeness of the striking lawyer. 
Lilith glowered at her for a moment, remembering Namaah's failure earlier in the 
 
day. "Do as you will, but don't take long. I would like to have our little jail bird in hand 
before the day is out." 
 

“Could you track her?” Lilith asked calmly, as though her mind was serene. 
“She has my seed, my power within her. If she gets close to us, I will know it.” 

Fear! Agrat’s thought shouted in her ears. Fear of Nathalia? No… fear of returning

largess as she did.

out of the elevator car and collapsing unceremoniously to the floor on her more than 
ample bottom.

Agrat was about to spring forward at real the Angela when she heard a very 

 
distinct noise from close in to her right. She looked at the corner of her eye to confirm 
what she'd heard. 
Wes was standing in a textbook weaver stance, his stainless steel Smith & 
 
Wesson .357 magnum revolver leveled at her face. "D-d-don't Move!" he shouted. He'd 
never had to draw his weapon in the eighteen years he'd worked at the building. And 
while things had been strange of late, this was by far the strangest thing he'd ever seen.

"I swear Natalie, it was her! It was the one who'd changed to look like me in the

feel her even before the door opened. And when we made eye contact it was all I could 
do to try to get away from her." 
 
"Calm down Angela. Do you have a pen and paper? I’m gonna give you an

could use your help, but we will go with or without you." 
 
 
and Matt, "She's in, whether she knows it or not, and she'll be here shortly."

Finally Agrat spoke up, "Blythe, take us back to the house." 
 
"As you command my queen." 
 
Just twenty minutes later they were back at the safe-house, the four of them 
 
trudging sullenly up the stairs. They walked into the apartment, Malleus flopping  into 
an aging recliner while Blythe moved into the kitchen. That left Agrat and Eisheth to

“I feel her. She is nearby!”

A few moments later, they were on the sidewalk near a large urban green space. 

“Agrat, that one,” she pointed at Cecelia, who was wearing a short white knit 

 

 

below a plunging “V” neck line. It was perfectly legal and completely inappropriate at 
the same time on her body. It wasn’t the clothing that gave her away though, it was the 
large amount of celestial power she had emanating from her decidedly human aura that 
made it obvious she’d been spending time with Natalie. 
 
She wasn’t the only one who stood out though. If Cee looked inappropriate, then 
Agrat and Eisheth screamed strippers or prostitutes, or both. In their presence Malleus  
with his outdated beige double-breasted suit looked like a down on his luck pimp. The 
three of them began following her at a moderate distance.

“Okay,” the administrative assistant turned bait replied. She knew where Matt 
was, almost half a mile away and eight stories up. But the knowledge that there were 
three demons following her didn’t make her feel very good. 
“The distance is fine,” Cianna came across the radio. 
 
“I’d feel better if I knew where you were Cianna,” Cee whispered over the radio. 
 
“I’m not far. Just keep walking toward Matt.” 
 
“I don’t feel Lilith,” Natalie said to Matt.  
 
“The two I see are an Asian woman with big tits, an Amazon with bigger tits and 
 
a dude who’s walking with them, kinda dumpy looking in an old suit,” Matt described.

“I thought that all of you were inhumanly strong,” Matt announced.

say what effect they would have on the queens, or for that matter, whoever the demon 
in the suit was. All told he had thirty of these “Vatican Specials”. He was just hoping 
they would be enough. 
“Roger,” Matt said, taking aim on “the suit” first. 
 
 
The big suppressed Accuracy International sniper rifle that Matt was seated 
behind was mounted to a beefy tripod, but the huge .338 Lapua Magnum cartridge was 
still stout enough that it made Matt rock backwards farther than he expected. It took 
him over a second to get back on the scope. The sight that greeted him was totally 
unexpected. Instead of a dumpy looking man in an ill- fitting suit there was a hulking 
demon. There was no other way to describe him. But what was worse was that the 
demon was looking straight at him. He watched through the scope, transfixed by the

It instantly flooded the cellular towers with thousands of calls a second, rapidly 
overloading the circuits and scramming the networks, effectively blocking anyone 
nearby from calling 911. While it didn't jam land lines there weren't too many houses 
close to the park and few of those still had them. It wouldn't last long as the batteries in 
the module weren't particularly heavy duty, but it would hopefully delay any police 
response long enough to resolve the battle for better or for worse. 
 
Meanwhile Natalie had shot into the air and was now over a thousand feet above 
the three demons below. She started diving on them now, pointing her body straight at 
Eisheth. Her wings tucked in tight, making minor adjustments to her course as gravity 
pulled her faster and faster toward her still unsuspecting prey. Eisheth wasn’t holding 
still, but rather moving rapidly toward Cee, and Natalie had scant seconds to adjust 
before the intercept. Just before impact she pulled her legs up, flipping around like a 
hawk about to snag its prey. 
 
For her part, Eisheth sensed something coming but with Natalie traveling at 
hundreds of miles per hour a fraction of a second wasn’t enough time for even a demon 
to react. Natalie’s clawed feet smashed into her shoulders with the force of a speeding 
truck, ripping into her flesh and sending her flying fifty feet forwards. Before she could

Another crack trough the earpiece announced the second round from Matt’s rifle, 
 
and Natalie heard the hissing snap of it pass overhead, followed by the slap of it hitting 
something behind her. She was herself recovering from her high-speed strike, keeping 
Eisheth pinned with her powerful legs as she prepared to strike a deathblow with her 
clawed hands when she felt a bone shattering pain explode into the center of her back.

Malleus turned on Cecelia only to be hit just below the collarbone by another 
long-range bullet from Matt’s rifle. The blessed rounds had little chance of banishing 
the powerful soldier demon, but each one sapped a bit more of his power as he fended 
off their holy energy. He shrugged it off but it slowed him down and he knew he didn’t 
want to take many more of them.

Natalie regained her feet to see Cianna engaging Malleus with her sword. She 
looked over in the direction of where Eisheth had been just in time to feel her whole 
face collapse under one of a transfigured Eisheth’s clawed fists. The blow lifted her 
airborne just long enough for Eisheth to reset for a massive uppercut that lifted her 

 

 

Then the blows started raining down. It looked for all the world like a bad last 

upward again. The third consecutive punch sent her flying nearly forty feet, and she 
could feel her insides rearrange around the fist as it displaced them momentarily. Her 
body slammed into the concrete wall of a bathroom with a loud crack, then slumped to 
the ground, shattered bits of the wall crumbling behind her. 
 
Brute force and physicality… Transfigured, Eisheth was a colossus. 15 feet of 
muscles on top of muscles, with breasts and hips bolted on more as afterthoughts. Even 
her tail was muscular, and much longer than any of the other queens, more like a 
dragon’s than a succubus’s. The honed muscular shape of her body was as awe 
inspiring as it was terrifying. Her black wings glittered with green in the waning 
twilight as she leapt to cover the distance between the two of them as if it were nothing. 
 
Eisheth landed on Natalie’s stomach, feeling to her for all the world like the 
demon’s knee had driven all the way through her body and into the pavement beneath 
her. She knew she needed to do something fast or be beaten into a quick submission. 
But that skin on skin contact also told her something about her opponent. Eisheth 
hadn’t built up a very significant energy reserve. If I can prolong this fight for a few 
minutes, I may be able to wear her down.

If Natalie didn’t change soon this would be over before it began. But would it matter 
against Eisheth’s brute strength? Do I have a choice? 
 
slapped into the shoulder of Eisheth, sending muscular pieces of black deltoid 
splattering from the head sized exit wound. Natalie’s bucked her hips while twisting 
her body and shoving up on her stunned, shrieking opponent, buying her the time to 
escape. She didn’t let go of the larger woman and instead plunged a balled fist nearly 
forearm deep into her capricious and exposed cunt. 
 
 Immediately she started pumping pleasurable feelings into her larger foe, while 
draining energies from her. She let out all the stops, pulling power from Eisheth as fast 
as she could, even as the larger woman started to respond to the unconventional 
assault. The ecstatic pleasure hampered the larger woman though, slowing her 
reactions and weakening her will to resist. As the power ebbed out of her, she began 
trying to struggle through the sensation fogging pleasure. Both of them knew it was 
already too little too late. Eisheth struggled to extricate Natalie’s buried hand from 
inside her, but it was almost beyond that. In seconds, faster than she’d imagined 
possible from anyone other than Lilith, Natalie had nearly drained her to her limits. 
 
The queen could feel her power draining fast, and knew that something had to 
happen. Fighting through the pleasure Eisheth brought her knee up as hard as she 
could into Natalie, driving the succubus off her. Rising quickly she tried to regain her 
composure, but it was obvious the tables had turned. While still brawny, there was a

gauntness to Eisheth now. Her flesh was thin and withered, and her formerly proud 
breasts were saggy bags of flesh that drooped below her shrunken pecs. Most noticeable 
was her reduced height. As Natalie rose the two of them were looking nearly eye to eye. 
Unlike when she siphoned the energies from mortals, this power came from 
 
demonic royalty, and its effect upon Natalie was different than the run of the mill 
essence she was used to. Needing the power now, she metabolized it instantly, and the 
initial effect on her was immediate. Her defined but feminine muscularity bulked up 
massively, rocketing into and then past champion male bodybuilders volumes 
momentarily, before it rebounded back to just beyond the extreme end of female 
bodybuilding Olympians. The feeling of naked strength that surged through her made 
her reflect on why Eisheth acted as direct and one dimensional as she did.           
 
raining down on Natalie. Wary of falling for the same trick again though, Eisheth was 
now striking at Natalie from range, and while she was landing blows the newly 
invigorated succubus was taking many of the hits in stride. Indeed the punches seemed 
largely ineffectual  

The now less imposing queen began a blindingly fast assault, a hail of blows 

“Not so tough now,” Natalie taunted, side stepping an uppercut and stepping 

inside a haymaker so that she was inches from the haggard queen  

“Give my regards to Lucifer," she commanded as she drew her hand back, then 

with blurring speed thrust it talons first deep into her chest and through her black heart. 
Eisheth’s body convulsed once as her sunken eyes went wide and then vanished in a 
brilliant red flash leaving only a cloud of dust and the reek of brimstone.

Worldwide, demons turned wide-eyed to the jolting disturbance of Eisheth 
 
Zenunim’s sudden banishment back to hell. To succubi all across Earth it felt like a 
pressure wave hit them, involuntarily driving the wind from their lungs and sending a 
shiver down their spines. To the three remaining Earth bound queens, it signified more 
than that. Nathalia Faust was indeed more dangerous than they had initially assumed. 
It also screamed her location to them like a homing beacon, and for Naamah, it put her 
back into the game. 
 
 

She was transfigured, airborne and streaking toward the embroiled succubus.

The fall of his queen distracted Malleus, who involuntarily turned toward the 

 
now ended battle he’d thought was going well, only to see Natalie glowing with 
celestial power. It would be his last mistake on earth, as in that brief lapse of 
concentration, his fight with Cianna that had been a draw to this point ended. Her 

 

 

enormous Zweihander very nearly cut him in half at the midpoint of his ribcage, 
showering the flagstones of the park with fuming black demon blood that sizzled as it 
burned into the ground. The gushing blood soon gave way to heat as his ancient body 
began to burn to ash and smoke from the inside, finally flashing out of existence leaving 
only a scorched suit as a reminder of his time on earth.

Her thoughts were distracted by the arrival of Naamah, who landed behind Cee

Cee’s hair. “Mmmmm. She smells delicious.” 
 
 
the big rifle. 
 
Naamah heard the conversation with her acute hearing play out through Cee’s 
earpiece, but it didn’t do her any good. The supersonic cross engraved bullet, blessed 
by some very devout Jesuit priests and containing a tiny silver capsule of holy water, 
streaked at over 3000 feet per second to its rendezvous with the back right quarter of 
her skull. The impact would have been instantly lethal to a mortal, but even with its 
blessings and symbolism, it did little more than send her head snapping sideways as 
her body’s powerfully evil energies cancelled out those of the bullet. It did surprise her 
enough that her grip around Cee’s neck faltered and the girl fell in a pile to the ground. 
Cianna had a fresh pistol in hand instantly and as fast as her finger could quick 
 
reset the trigger was showering the new arrival with bullets and sprinting at her with 
the big sword trailing behind in her left hand. The slide locked back on the weapon in

Then her body started morphing, adding muscle even as her height stretched 

Natalie watched all this unfold in slow motion. She was keenly aware of every

pop of the large caliber automatic, and her eyes could see the brass casings and the little 
marks made by the extractor along the rim. The bullets moving down range seemed to 
be moving at barely jogging speed, and the grooves made by the lands in the gun’s 
barrel were slowly spinning around the projectile’s axis. Cianna herself was hardly 
moving, despite obviously being at a dead sprint. There was a building rush that was 
ramping up in her body. Her body was still to metabolizing the raw celestial energy 
she’d pulled from Eisheth. There was none of her body’s usual delay in converting 
fluids or taking terrestrial power and transforming it to a usable form. No, this was like 
someone had main-lined an artery in her neck with some supercharged mind altering 
substance, flooding it directly to her brain. 
 
upward. Natalie felt her pelvis broaden, adding more flare to her already dramatic hips, 
even as her ass added more flesh to pad its bubbly shape. But as she was predisposed to 
do, the majority to the stored energy flooded into her breasts, like someone had 
plugged a hose into each of them, and turned the water on. With her newly skewed 
comprehension of time, it seemed to be a slow process, but in reality the changes were 
happening fast, almost instantly so. They surged past any useful means of measure in 
seconds and entered the realm of preposterous, even on her new nearly ten and a half 
foot frame. 
 
Natalie’s assimilation of Eisheth’s stolen power. Added to that, Cianna had now

aside as Cianna slashed down on her. 
 
and clawed hands that sent the ageless woman sprawling to the ground, the 
Zweihander clattering out of reach on the concrete stonework. She licked the salty 
blood from her claws with a smile and something seemed to come over her. Her pearly 
white teeth and long fangs stood out in bold contrast to her shiny black skin, and her 
pupils dilated hugely. She was airborne in a flash and landing on top of Cianna just as 
quickly. Something was in the assassin’s hands as she landed though. 
 
just being finely pointed; it was also a celestial weapon. It had saved her life almost a 
millennium ago and it didn’t disappoint today. The blade sliced across the outside of 
Naamah’s left thigh, cutting deep into the bone and rending all those muscles and 
tendons worthless. Celestial or not, her body’s function still relied upon connective

Appraising her situation, it was obvious that she was at a disadvantage now.

The final round from the big rifle struck Naamah’s back center-mass, passing

“Save ‘em,” She called back backed away from the demon. The pain from her

before she could scream. 
 
Naamah kicked into Cianna’s side as best she could as she toppled to the 
pavement, digging talons on her toes deep into the holy warrior’s mid-section. Added 
to this, scalding hot acidic blood from the gaping wound sprayed over her right arm 
and upper body before she could roll clear. She scrambled to her feet and doffed her 
coat and the long sleeve shirt beneath it as quickly as she could, screaming as she felt 
some of the vile fulminating liquid burning into her flesh.  
 
With no weapons beyond the dagger in hand, she was going to need Natalie’s help and

incomprehension was on her face, followed by momentary panic, then calm rage and 
concentration. Her roiling vitae gushed in torrents from around the sword in front and 
behind her. She grabbed the celestially sharp blade with her hands and began pulling 
herself forward even as the edges carved deep gashes into her hands. 
 
refused to die. Her curvaceous body rapidly became less and less outlandish as she 
willed her energies into repairing her thudding heart which with every beat was 
shredding itself upon the swords edge. Naamah had pulled herself about halfway off 
the long blade when Natalie gave a heave and drove the riccasso all the way through 
her, while twisting the blade and lifting up. Naamah wouldn’t be stopped though. 

“Not yet,” came a clarion clear voice behind her.

bared, face a snarling mask of hatred. But there was something else that Natalie could 
feel from her contemptuous former superior. Fear!  
 
Naamah’s left, which barely managed to deflect the blow from being significantly more 
damaging. Then Natalie was upon her, forcing the queen to the pavement, and taking a 
mounted position atop her as she rained piercing blows down on Naamah, trying 
everything she could to get a clear shot at the stricken demon's weakened heart. 
 
an eye was scant feet from Natalie, a grizzly looking knife in hand. In the time the 
rebellious succubus could start to turn to face the new threat Agrat had plunged the evil 
weapon into her back three times and was already out of range. Natalie sagged under 
the rapid skirmish, and Naamah took that moment to counter attack. 
 
Natalie could do to protect her most vital of organs from the queen’s renewed attack. 
Instead of going straight for the kill, Naamah punished Natalie’s nerve centers, hitting 
pressure points and rapidly subduing any capability the stunned succubus had to 
defend herself beyond protecting her heart. She knew she was too weak to kill Natalie, 
but she could set her up for her sisters.  

Seeing an opening, Agrat sprang from hiding at that moment and in the blink of

the two queens, she was barely able to hold her own. She needed to regain the 
advantage. 
 
skyward, blackened bronze wings almost blowing her frail opponent from her feet as 
she tried to stand. Agrat was not so deterred and shot into the air in chase. Too weak to 
prusue, Naamah moved back to the sword Natalie had discarded, and started searching 
for Cianna and Cee, the angelic weapon's energy clashing with her own. 
 
The two demons spiraled around each other as they climbed higher and higher, 
jockeying for the advantage like a pair of dueling raptors. Indeed from afar they looked 
like a falcon harassing a large hawk as Agrat's clawed right hand ripped at Natalie's 
wings even as the dagger in her left continued to make deep cuts in her extremities. She 

used her small size and incredible speed to dance around Natalie's stronger but less 
nimble form. The blade caught the tendons of her right hand, causing it to hang

her briefly within her reach. It was an opportunity the succubus didn't squander, as the 
wickedly sharp nails of her left fore and middle fingers caught the queen by foot, 
driving through it and instantly halting her escape. .  

Natalie cut hard into Agrat, catching the smallest queen off guard and bringing

quicker than they’d gained it.  
 
just seconds before landing, and she secured Agrat's left hand at the wrist, using the 
two points of control to put the queen between her and the ground the two were 
hurtling toward. 
 
Agrat hit the ground on her right side, and Natalie felt every bone between the 
queen’s shoulders and several ribs shatter under their combined weight. The succubus 
tumbled clear of the broken queen gracelessly before trying to spring up, but found her 
newly mended arm had dislocated in the landing and it took her a moment to pop it 
back into place. Still Agrat was down, and this was her chance to finish another queen. 
She moved over to the broken demon, 
We can do this... 
 
 
reached out in desperation to stop the blow. Her good hand caught the queen's at the 
left elbow, and her still markedly superior strength was enough to stop the down 
stroke. Naamah bellowed in indignation, and moved her right hand to Natalie’s wrist 
below her elbow. 
 
knitting beneath her, and more frightening still, the tingle of Naamah pulling power 
from her. Natalie began reciprocating immediately, but this was one area where the 
queens were unrivaled, and Natalie could tell she was losing. She looked into Naamah's 
eyes, seeing the hollow flesh around them becoming less gaunt, her face starting to fill 
out from the wasted look it had held before, then looked up at the big sword, the storm 
of polarized energy radiating from where her hand touched the holy weapon. Then in a 
surreal moment, she watched as that lower arm separated at the elbow from the rest of 
Naamah’s body and flew backwards, accompanied with a loud noise. 
 

"NATALIE!" sceramed Cee. 
She turned in time to see Naamah with the Zweihander raised overhead, and she 

Natalie could feel two bad things happening simultaneously: Agrat's bones

was upon the black queen, knee strike after knee strike crushing her bones beneath her. 
Naamah was still weakened by the punishment she’d already endured that she couldn’t 
heal as fast as the damage could be done. Her arm had stopped bleeding but Natalie’s 
thumbs had punctured her jugular with a razor sharp talon.  
 
Naamah was bleeding out her power rapidly and as it diminished so did her

for all succubi, the mold by which all of them had been cast. Now though, she was 
something more, something beyond. She’d gained power and abilities well in excess 
that which she’d originally been endowed. Originally designed for the corruption of 
men’s souls, she was now a machine of unrelenting lust, capable of bending any to her 
sexually deviant whims. And with such abilities had come excesses.  
Even at twelve feet tall, her body was a collection of extreme curves. Hips and 
 
thighs that were so outrageous they defied comprehension. An ass that was so round, 
so firm, that not just a saucer, but a whole platter could rest atop it. Her waist by 
comparison was narrow; a sweeping pair of curves, the supple flesh covering subtle 
feminine muscularity that unified her epic lower body with the largest, firmest, most 
awe-inspiring breasts any of them (save Natalie) had ever seen. And her pale white skin 
did not merely hint at radiance, it absolutely glowed with an inner light. Easily the most 
amazing thing about her though, was the absolute masterful grace with which she 
moved. Lilith was in complete control of all aspects of her existence, and everyone

“Lil-,” Natalie began to reply, when she winced and staggered. “My… Queen,” 
 
she finished, falling to a knee with straining hesitation. Her demonic body melted back 
into its human form, an oversexed vision of physical power and sex appeal. 
“Come child,” she beckoned with a curling finger. With just a few simple words 
 
Lilith’s powerful voice conveyed dominance, command and superiority. On the surface 
her voice sounded accepting, even forgiving, but all knew that those kind emotions 
were a façade as fictional as her 'mortal' body.

steal some of Lilith’s thunder. With only feet to go she felt something hit her sternum. A 
look of confusion spread across her face. Her lightning sprint slowed as she sailed 
between Natalie and Lilith looking down at the hilt of a knife that was sticking from her 
chest. But she’d been a safe distance away… no mortal was able to match her speed! 
She spun around to see Cianna dropping from a run twenty meters away.  Cianna could

She felt the holy power from the weapon flow through her as she brought it to a high 
guard and then flipped the sword around so that she held the blade in her hands

“Happy Home” 

 

Additionally, Cianna wasn’t supposed to make any kind of formal contact with 

Cianna watched from a bench seat in the lobby of the building that Fox, Bryce 
 
and Barlowe occupied. She was taking in everything, but most importantly, she was 
waiting for the return of Natalie Faust. She was the only person with any memory of the 
events of three days ago. She’d never met an Angel before that Friday, let alone the 
three archangels but they had explained it all to her. 
Natalie Faust was now effectively human. She would have no recollection of her 
 
former existence, either in Heaven or Hell. And neither Angela nor Cee nor Matt would 
remember any of the details of their transformations. Any and everyone that Natalie 
had ever touched with her celestial power would have no recall of whatever changes 
they’d received either good bad or indifferent. It would be as if it had always been that 
way. 
 
the three of them. They wouldn’t remember her anyway, but it would prevent any kind 
of unforeseen complications. But the 800 pound gorilla in the room was the fact that 
Natalie was an angel again. She didn’t know it, nor did she have any memories of the 
divine existence. For all intents and purposes, Natalie was supposed to be just a person. 
Cianna just wanted to see what kind of person. 
 
It was ten minutes before 9:00 AM as they came through the glass doors of the 
building’s main doorway. Natalie, Cee and Angela entered the building together, and 
what an entrance they made. 
 
The Archangels hadn’t spared any details in the restoration of Natalie. If 
anything, they’d seen fit to improve on her. At six feet even before the significant high 
heels she was wearing, she dominated the vast lobby, gliding with a superb cat-like 
grace. Her skin had a positively golden glow. The perfectly tailored skirt and matching 
blazer were conservative in that they ended just above the knee and thanks to a  blouse 
with the top-button undone showed only a fine gold cross below the neck line. But at 
the same time, with her incomprehensible curves, nothing could really be conservative.  

Meanwhile Cee and Angela looked like sisters, albeit with raven and brown hair 

 
respectively. But their bodies were almost bosomy mirrors of each other. The 
Archangels had returned Angela to her healthy state before her meeting with the 
queens, and apparently left what Natalie and Matt’s alterations had done intact. The 
effect was most dramatic as the two of them walked into the lobby glowing while they 
talked to one another. Nobody who didn’t know otherwise would have thought that 
they were twelve years apart in age, and before long rumors would spread around the 
office about their relationship together.

Well good for them. Cianna thought as she stood to leave the building.

that Cianna wasn’t aware of. A simple gold band adorned her left ring finger. A smile 
crossed her face as she felt an interesting sensation pass through her, followed by a 
warmth in her belly. She remembered the romp she and Matt had shared just that 
morning. She pulled out her cell phone and pressed the button with Matt's face on it. It 
rang twice before it was picked up. 
 
 
And I know you love my tits.” 
 
sheepish chuckle. 
 
 
 
 
 

“Well what if I told you they are gonna get bigger?” 
"What do you mean?" Matt asked quizzically. 
"We're going to have a baby... a little girl." 
There was a long pause as Matt took a moment to process what he’d just heard. 
"Uhh… how do you know?" 
"It's... it's just a feeling," Natalie responded. "A wonderful little feeling.” 
Then from deep within her subconscious came a spark of inspiration. 
“Let's name her Patience." 

“Yeah, almost as much as you seem to love my… tool” he replied with a

“Untouchable” 

 

Cianna landed at the now familiar Boeing Field at 5:09 AM, four minutes after its 

“So what happened?” 
“It was definitely a sanctioned move, a very big one. Probably multiple entities,” 

“Ms. Di’Trieste, welcome to Seattle,” he said approaching the smaller woman. 
“Marcus,” she acknowledged. “Coffee first, then work.” 
The two of them made light conversation as they collected her baggage. Finally

her contact to meet her. That contact was a bookish looking man with close cut tightly 
curling brown hair and about two days worth stubble.

hand, and in route to her hotel, she allowed him to start briefing her. 
 
 
he announced, taking the on-ramp onto the freeway from the airport. 
“Do we have any theories as to why they would be here?” 
 
 
“There is a good deal of new age and occult activity in the area. We are 
monitoring several first tier demons in the area, plus of course our favorite succubus.” 
“Yes, I think we may want to get in touch with Natalie.” 
 
 
“Oh? I’ve not made contact with her yet. She called me asking for your number a 
few days ago actually. She said it was important, I’m sorry if that was inappropriate.”

“No, it was good that you did.” She reassured him. 
“May I ask what that was about? The demon was rather insistent.” 
“She fought off a demonic hybrid and managed to successfully remove its heart 

“I’ve been moving in,” he replied defensively. 
“Yes, we’d better go visit her now.” she replied casting an annoyed look at him 

“Wait, she fought off a fellow demon on Earth? Why would she do that?” 
“You will have to meet her. But let me just tell you this, she is unique, and she

The phone ringing brought Natalie from her “sleep” with merely the snapping 

“What? You work for us!” he shouted, his own anger rising now at her reluctance 

“FUCK! OFF!” She said hanging up. 
Marcus looked disbelievingly at the receiver. 
“Nicely done. How did you ever get assigned this position?” Cianna glared at 

“Hello?” her irritation dripped through the receiver. 
“Natalie, this is Marcus Lilley. Buzz me in.” 
“Now? Have you any idea what time it is?” she growled. 
“Don't raise your voice at me de—” 
“If you think this is a good way to introduce yourself to me, you are grossly

“Why didn’t she let us in?” he asked rhetorically, ignoring her. 
 
“Probably because you came across as a first rate ass-hat.” 
 
“But she has to let us in…” 
 
 
“I am going to be recommending your removal from work as a handler.” Cianna 
said. "Clearly there was some padding of your résumé to grant this position to one with 
your lack of... finesse. Or social skills for that matter."

disdain for him when her eyes moved over him. She was “dressed” in a silk baby doll

Natalie returned from the kitchen with a pair of coffee mugs putting one in front

For his part, Marcus couldn’t believe what he had just been told. He stood 

“Marcus, I would be a bit more tactful in her house, we are guests here,” Cianna 

 

 

The speed and force she landed on him flattened him to the floor. Her eyes 

“Think very carefully about what you are doing right now Marcus,” Cianna 

Matt sprang into action, flipping his three fourths full coffee cup at Marcus. The

holster in his pants leveled at Cianna’s face. 
 
warned calmly. “You won’t make it out of this apartment building if you do what you

already pulling the slack out of the trigger. She could see it pause as the tension on the 
sear block mounted, pressure behind his finger building.

Several miles away, the queens did indeed felt the spike of power radiating from 
 
Natalie’s apartment, and while they now had the direction to travel, they were together 
on another task, in a rancid smelling alley in china town. 

“Here it is,” Eisheth announced at the boarded up doorway. A quick shove from 

 
her brawny arms forced the door open to reveal the unworldly darkness inside, along 
with the reek of many days old cum still slowly drying on the floor. 
 
 

“Malleus, lover, your queen demands your allegiance.” She called musically. 
“SUCCUBUS! BE GONE!” came a booming growl. 
Lillith strode into the darkness ahead of Eisheth. “I’ve no time for games,

Just as quickly Lillith side stepped the reckless assault and with an inhumanly 
 
fast and strong blow changed his course mid-flight to face plant into the stone floor. 
 
“Is that any way to greet the queens of Hell, chosen envoys of Satan?” Naamah 
asked, saccharine sweet while stepping up to him as he  lay forcibly prostrate on the 
floor.

Natalie walked off the elevator at a quarter till nine, dressed in a hip hugging 

Heads turned to tracked her into the office. Dilating eyes and tongue-whetted 

 
black skirt ending as high as dress code allowed, a hunter green satin second skin 
blouse and a short double breasted style black jacket that strained to contain the 
overstuffed blouse. Coupled with old fashioned seamed stockings and towering heels, 
emerald stud earrings and high gloss red lipstick, Ms. Faust was pumping up the sexual 
tension in the office to an almost tactile level. The pheromone “perfume” that she was 
filling the enclosed spaces in the office with helped ensure that those for whom visuals 
weren’t enough got into the spirit. This might very well be her last day at Fox, Bryce

“I’m O positive,” Matt said, overhearing her on the phone. “But shouldn’t this be

seconds. Before leaving the stair well she did something she’d never done before at 
work; unbuttoning three buttons on her blouse. The relieved stress on the buttons was 
immediately evident as deep cleavage was suddenly bare for all in the building to see.

“Hello Ms. Faust.” He managed to say without stammering. 
 
 
Natalie pulled out all the stops, filling the lobby with enough suggestive 
pheromones to turn the bottom seven floors of building into a giant orgy before the 
HVAC system cleared the air. On poor Wes at ground zero, the effect was to become a 
glassy eyed mute whose gaze oscillated between her eyes, mouth and cleavage over 
and over again. All he could do was nod as she moved behind the counter and secured 
the large first responder bag stored there, then retreated back to the stairs, brushing her 
hand against his ever so briefly as she left the security checkpoint. His wife of twenty

“I don’t want to die,” Angela said as she started to cry. 
“I don’t want you to either, Angela. Try to stay calm. Help is coming.” 
Natalie’s cell phone rang a moment later. “Natalie Faust,” she answered it. 
“I ‘m down stairs, I need an escort.” Matt said. 
“I will get you one,” she said hanging up. She called the security desk where Wes 

“What are you gonna do with those?” Cecilia asked. 
“I am going to give her a blood transfusion and try to save her life.” Natalie 

Flying up the stairs, she was back up in her office with the big kit in less time 

Three minutes later, there was a knock at her office door, and Natalie slipped 

“Angie, cut me some slack, we’re gonna save your life.” Natalie said rebutting 

“Hello? I mean, Lobby, Security Station.” 
“Wes? This is Ms Faust, can you see to it that Matthew Willcox is escorted up

“Thanks, you’re a peach,” she declared hanging up.

As Wes reluctantly turned and left, Matt saw her demeanor change to one much

right now. Give me a second,” He took the IV line she’d rigged into a double ended line

“Okay, I guess,” Matt said laying back on her desk. 
“Cee, make sure the door is locked,” Natalie commanded. 

“When this bag is empty,” Natalie said jamming the spiked end of another IV 

“Just a question, but how do will we know when I’ve given her a pint?” Matt 

 

 

“Okay,” she replied moving to the doorway and checking the lock. A feeling of 

 
euphoria that was spreading through her as Matt’s warm blood infused with her 
meager supply. Something was building inside her withered form, an energy that had 
been pulled from her by that terrible woman what felt like an eternity ago, even if it 
were just yesterday. 
 
Natalie looked at the draining bag on the table next to her lover as it dripped its 
last drops into the steel waste bin. With deft fingers she pulled the catheter from Matt’s 
arm and closed the line. Pulling the catheter plug from the line with a razor sharp nail 
she sliced open her own arm, and dripped a few drops of her own blue-black blood into 
the surgical tubing. Then letting the line briefly open again, she allowed her donation to 
mix with the far greater quantity Matt had offered up to the stricken woman on the 
ground. Finally, she hooked up another IV bag to run, this time directly into Angela, 
just to replace lost fluids. 
 
Natalie’s demonic vitae was slow to start, but the result wasn’t any less impressive. 
Angela’s body began fleshing out before their eyes. She could feel her body’s energy 
welling up, growing stronger inside her. Her heart was hammering in her chest, its rate 
accelerating as the mingling blood built up the exponentially surging feedback loop of 
mounting celestial power. But the decadent life forces of Matt and Natalie were 
tempered by the near lifeless sanguine fluid that languidly oozed through her veins. 
 
Watching the transformation before her eyes, Natalie could see the rapid 
improvement in Angela’s physical health, but she could feel the dulled effects caused 
by her drained energy levels. What would happen if we were to do this to a healthy person? 
 
 
Angela climbed to her feet, pulling the IV from her now healthy looking arm.  
 

“Wow,” was all Cee could seem to form for words. 
Then to her surprise, a completely revitalized and indeed drastically improved

Zubud was not a popular demon among her compatriots. She was small, sharp 
tempered, and easily agitated. She did have one attribute that was particularly useful 
though. She was good at picking up on mundane details, and along with that, her 
eyesight was top flight. So when she caught sight of Cianna all but carrying Marcus out 
of Natalie’s apartment building by chance, she made pursuit. 
 
New York City not two days ago, and as such it made very good sense to follow the 
infamous demon hunter. On top of that, with the four queens walking the earth, and in 
the same city no less; there was good reason to think that the demon hunter’s location 
might be valuable. Who the enfeebled man was, was of little consequence. 

The rumors had been flying that Cianna and a succubus had killed a demon in 

 

 

Zubud had seen the car pull into the parking garage and knew that there was 

Down in the Scion, Cianna was struggling to navigate Seattle’s myriad one way 

“Eyes! Above us! Following us, everywhere we go!” he muttered in rising tones. 
Cianna paused for a moment to look over at him, and saw him craning his neck 

She made the next left and zipped into a parking garage. 
“Stay here Marcus,” she said unnecessarily just before getting out of the car with 

 
streets to get to the hotel she was staying in, all the while dealing with Marcus’ 
rambling on and on about the darkness when he suddenly got very quiet.

about his changed manner made her adjust her side mirror to look skyward and 
behind, and sure enough there was a dark colored bird flying high above…

only one way out, and so she chose to land among the gargoyles perched on the roof of 
a building across the street. She would have a good vantage point of the garage’s exit 
from there and wouldn’t risk much undue suspicion in a busy city. 
But as good as her eyesight was, her hearing was not. She did not notice the 
 
slamming of the fire door on the roof of the building across the street. In fact, she didn’t 
hear the bolt of Cianna’s hastily assembled Remington 700 suitcase carbine locking 
forward its .30-‘06 caliber bullet either. It wasn’t until the suppressed rifle’s first round 
exploded her left scapula out the back of her gnarled body that she knew she’d been 
made by Cianna. 
The demon was scrambling airborne again when the second round blew her 
 
hand off into a ragged stump below the wrist, but it didn’t stop her, and she beat a 
hasty corkscrewing retreat, feeling several more rounds whip past her harmlessly. 
When she was several miles away, she landed on a water tower and surveyed the 
damage. Her shoulder was already largely healed, but the missing hand would take 
several hours longer to recover. In the meantime, she needed to tell the queens what 
had just happened. A hunter as dangerous as Cianna Di‘Trieste could jeopardize their 
presence here. They needed to know now.

Cianna had already disposed of the rifle shell casings in several dumpsters 

 
throughout the city. Between the flash suppressor’s limited silencing capabilities, and 
her position on the rooftop, she was doubtful that too many people had paid much 
mind to the rifle shots, but one could never be too careful. Marcus had fallen asleep in 
the meantime as well, which was also nice. His constant babbling was getting irritating. 
But all of this was distracting her from the real issue at hand. Was she being followed 
by servants of Satan? Or had it been a random occurrence? With as much occult activity 

 

 

as there was in town right now, it would be hard to figure out. Either way, she had to 
assume that she’d been made.

The sun was setting when Naamah knocked on the door and then entered the

straining in tumescence. In quick succession one would climax, shooting a fountain of 
cum in a high arc landing upon her only to vanish the instant it contacted her alabaster 
skin. Between her fleshy thighs a young woman was servicing her pussy noisily. About

She slid the answer call slider and answered, “Hello?” 
“Nathalia,” a chillingly familiar voice came across the speaker. 
She hung up immediately. 
“Who was that?” Matt asked groggily. 
“Lilith is at my front door.” 
“Who’s Lilith?” Cecelia asked.

“Eisheth, you may have the honors, she’s up stairs,” Lilith announced stepping

ripping the door apart as she had the front door, since it opened in, she just ran through

of the building like a bomb went off.

transfiguration. Taller and taller she grew, while her subtle muscularity became more 
pronounced. Horns sprouted from her hair and grew to nearly six inches in length, 
while black wings unfolded and spread the width of the living room. Her hands and 
feet lengthened and the nails grew longer and pointed, her toenails almost claw-like, 
while her skin changed from pale pink to dark bronze. Her eyes stayed green but now 
glowed like neon apertures into her being. Her facial features stayed very similar, and 
her hair only darkened a few shades, but expanded into a wavy mane of wild locks. The 
transformation ended with the extension of a spaded, whip like tail that slithered down 
from her tailbone to the floor. 
 
“Behold, I am Nathalia! Cast down angel, demon, succubus, one of God’s first 
children, an unwilling minion of Satan. I am proof to you that Heaven above and Hell 
below both exist, and are at all times at war for your soul,” she announced in a

Then the young secretary did something totally unexpected and stood up,

of them, and Cee recoiled from the contact shaking her hand.

“See, I told you she was smart,” Natalie said to Matt with a genuine smile. 
“You said unwilling minion of Satan. What does that mean?” she asked. 
“It means she’s not working for him,” Matt said before Natalie could. 
“I am trying to get back into God’s good graces. I am trying to be a good girl.” 

“My place in the battle was… complicated,” Natalie started to explain. 
"I want to know how you got here. I mean, you said you had been a prisoner in 
hell, but how does one escape, and how did you get to be the way you are now?" Matt 
interjected. 
 
 

“But if you were cast down, how can you do that? Wasn’t there some big battle

some steam ship. He was the first one we ran into, but he had money, which satisfied 
Patience's requirement, and he was ready, which fulfilled mine. I can't say he was the 
best lay but as weak as I was, any sexual contact was divine. Just the lust he had for 
Patience done up as she was, was invigorating, and his moment of release... Earth-
shattering. 
 
hard and ready to go again for longer. I pushed my host's consciousness aside, sharing 
the emotions and sensation from the first person. We rode him to a second, much more 
spectacular orgasm, milking him for all his body could muster without permanently 
hurting him. I had to fight my ingrained need to keep from draining him to dust right 
before Patience's eyes, but even so he was unable to leave her bed by himself. 
 
firmly in command of this body, and slowly but surely I pushed Patience to the back of 
"my" mind. Sure, I let her run things for another month as she slowly weaned herself off 
of prostitution. And I kept my word and healed her body, let her savor the feeling of

in here, sleeping. Still living 139 years after we made our deal."

"I could have locked her away permanently at any time over the past 139 years, 
but I can't. She did me the greatest favor a mortal could in my most desperate time of 
need. And she never caused me any hardship. I hope that someday I can let her free, 
but it's beyond my ability. So she stays asleep. Maybe she dreams of what I do in the 
mortal world, or maybe not. I can't talk to her, I wish I could. I just know she's still 
there," Natalie said in an almost sad tone. 
 

"So why do you sound sad?" Cee asked after a pause.
