Aquande took a deep breath as she walked into the foyer of the mansion. It was well known that an unusual creature inhabited this building. There were rumors that it was an unusually powerful succubus, tethered by an ancient ritual. Other rumors posed that it was simply a vampire that enjoyed the many adventurers as food. Sadly, nobody could confirm any of it as true or false, just that nobody returned once they set foot inside. As the large door shut itself, Aquande realized why it was so hard to escape. The handle was only on the outside and all of the windows were too small for even a human child to pass through. She sighed as she realized how careless she was to assume the handle would exist on both sides. Aquande shrugged off the situation, making a mental note that she would need one of her teleportation or portal spells to leave the building if she couldn�t find another exit. Being a talented mage had its perks.



Aquande, despite her age, was a sorceress of strong reputation when she was hired for this job. Her body was well developed, her breasts rivaling melons in size and firmness and needing an enchanted bra to be properly supported. Her hips were generous, and it made her thankful that she typically wore loose robes to hide her curves from the more lecherous individuals. She didn�t like wasting magic on pests. Despite the loose robes, though, it was easy to see that her bosom would not simply be hidden from view without additional enchantments.



Aquande walked further in, eyeing her surroundings for any indication of where the mistress of this building would be hiding. She came to a rather grand staircase, which split around a semicircle balcony. Leaning casually on the edge of the thick, extravagantly carved rail was a voluptuous pale skinned woman, her attire an odd mix of exotic, formal and seductive. A black corset with red lining made sure that attention was drawn to her unusually large figure. Her bosom jiggled with every step, the large orbs forming deep cleavage that looked like it could swallow your head, and then the rest of you. Her hips swayed with every step, her succulent thighs rubbing against each other with each motion. A loose skirt hid most of her derriere, but it was fairly obvious with the shelf behind her that it could compete with her chest in size. Her loose, straight black hair trailed down to her waist but swished eerily, as if carried by a light wind that was only around her.



She smiled as she saw Aquande walk in front of the staircase, her unusually white teeth seeming to glint. As if to welcome her, she started to make her way down the staircase. �It seems yet another has come to make an attempt to kill me.� She said nonchalantly, as if knowing there was no way she could lose. �I�ll give you 3 attacks, your choice. If you can knock me off my feet with any of them, I�ll let you live. Give it your best, little mage.� She finished with a highly condescending tone.



Aquande gritted her teeth and threw her left arm forward, launching a fireball directly at the woman. As the fireball landed with a large explosion, a wicked cackle was heard. Aquande�s face drained of color as she realized that nothing happened. There was no sign that anything was damaged. �That was certainly stronger than I expected, little mage.� The woman said with glee. �You�ll be an excellent servant.� As Aquande started to think about her next attack, the woman smirked. �If you put sufficient power behind the next attack, I�ll give you my name.�



Aquande concentrated as she held a hand above her. Above her hand, an orb swelled as she poured in loads of mana. The orb started to quiver, becoming unstable with how much magic was poured in. Aquande used this signal to throw it at the woman, the blast causing all of the dust in the room to rise up in a cloud. Aquande coughed as she waited for the dust to settle. When it did, her jaw, and her hopes for survival, dropped. The woman�s curves, previously extreme on a human frame, looked like they belonged on something much larger. Her bosom now hung past her navel and looked like it was wider than her hips. It was impossible to see if there were any other effects, though, as the woman�s bosom obscured the view of anything else. Despite her current size, Aquande could tell that the woman�s modesty was maintained by the corset that barely fit around her bosom now, making her new cleavage look like an abyss of seduction.



A cackle rang out as the dust finally settled, and Aquande could see the woman�s head tilting forward as she caught her breath. �For a girl your size, you certainly pack much more magic than I thought possible!� the inhumanly large woman said as she wiped her eyes. Aquande started to stagger, as the drain she put on her magic finally took its toll on her body. �Poor girl, put so much into that you couldn�t possibly make a third attack. My name is Sapphira. What�s yours?� Sapphira inquired as she explored her bloated curves with both hands.



�It�s� Aquande�� the mage struggled to say. Her knees started to buckle, but before falling, she felt herself caught by invisible hands. �Well, Aquande, you certainly proved yourself a cut above the others who tried to attack me. Had you been a century sooner, you would have given me a run for my money.� Aquande could only grunt as the invisible hands pulled her into Sapphira�s massive chest, holding her firmly in the cleavage. �Don�t worry. You�ve earned the privilege to live on. A lesser opponent and I would have absorbed them without a second thought.� Aquande tried to catch her breath, the pressure of Sapphira�s cleavage and new aura making it difficult. �Instead, I�m going to turn you into my personal magic fountain.� Aquande�s eyes went wide, and screamed loudly enough that the birds in the nearby trees scattered.



Aquande�s eyes opened slowly, groggily trying to wake up. She squinted as dawn�s light poured into her room. Rubbing the sleep from her eyes, she groaned as she felt a pressure in her chest. She tried to move, then realized her breasts now covered, and pinned, her legs as she sat in a rather plush bed. She tried to utilize magic to lift her breasts, but to no avail. She put a hand to her head as she tried to remember what happened last night. The last thing she could remember clearly was throwing an overcharged magic missile. The pressure surged in her chest, and she tentatively rubbed her bloated breasts. �I�m so full� What am I full of and why?� Aquande questioned, not sure when she�d get an answer. There was a knock at the door, and she cried out �Help me! Get in here and help me please!�



The door opened slowly and Sapphira walked in, Aquande�s voice choking in her throat as she suddenly realized she had become her prisoner. The mage started to cry rivers as Sapphira, who had managed to reduce her curves to their original size from the night before, sat beside her and tried to console her. �Now now, Aquande.� She said as a hand stroked the sorceress� hair and the other held her head to her bosom. �If you�re a good girl, and provide me plenty of magic, I�ll let you roam the house freely. But first you need to prove that you�ll be a good girl.�



Through red eyes, Aquande looked up and nodded. �Please mistress, they�re so full. I feel ready to pop!� Sapphira only grinned before moving in front of Aquande�s massive, boulder-sized breasts and latching onto a turgid nipple. Aquande cried out in relief and pleasure as thick milk sprayed directly down Sapphira�s throat. Sapphira gulped down every drop effortlessly, somehow not even needing to take a breath. After one breast was drained, Sapphira went to the other without hesitation, resulting in Aquande squirming under her own breasts as she felt more and more pleasure. Once Aquande was fully drained, Sapphira wiped a few drops of blue milk from her lips with one finger..



�You produced milk so rich in mana I actually feel a little bloated.� Sapphira said with a giggle, holding her milk-soaked finger near Aquande�s face as she once more sat next to her. Her curves now pressed even more enticingly against Aquande. �Do you want a taste?� Sapphira offered, teasing Aquande. The mage nodded, and Sapphira licked her finger clean. Aquande was about to pout when she suddenly felt Sapphira�s plump ruby lips against her own, with a tongue invading her mouth and tasting like an extremely powerful mana replenishment potion. Aquande�s eyes rolled into the back of her head as the taste overwhelmed her, feeling her breasts start to fill up again as the mana replenishment triggered new production.



�Maybe this isn�t such a bad ending to my career as an adventurer�� Aquande thought to herself as she felt Sapphira latch on once more, her mistress� breasts starting to push out and underneath her own.
