<p>BEWITCHED - CHAPTER 1</p>
<p>The Transforming Bra</p>
<p>By CoolAlmonds</p>
<pre><code>Adam was going to sneak into the girls locker room. It’s not that he was a pervert- well, he was a bit of a pervert, but he had a good enough reason; he needed his phone back.

Sarah Martin had been his mortal enemy since grade school. They also had been crushing on each other since grade school. But when you’re an awkward teenager, you tend to express your crushes in awkward ways. Sure, stealing someone’s phone isn’t exactly a way to get someone to like you, but it is a way to get their attention. Well, Sarah had gotten his attention.

CFuck you, Sarah,” Adam thought as he approached the entrance to the girls locker room. It was 4:34 PM. Tuesday. School was out, and the girls swim team (Sarah included) was practicing until 4:45. Adam had just managed to talk his way into getting out of debate club early. He was good at debating. The security camera in this hallway had been broken for months; a better place and time to sneak into the girls locker room for purely necessary purposes, there never was.

CPurely necessary purposes,” Adam repeated to himself, sounding a bit like he was trying to convince himself it was true. He just needed his phone! If he had to dig through Sarah’s clothes to get to it, well... maybe she shouldn’t have taken it, then. He turned red, and walked into the locker room.

He had wasted a minute or two thinking to himself, so he needed to be quick. He turned the corner and saw a row of lockers, with a long bench stretching the whole room. On it, sat piles of clothes. And underwear. Adam turned redder, and began scanning for Sarah’s clothes.

There! He recognized the gray sweater she’d been wearing that day, and moved toward Sarah’s pile of clothes on the bench. And his phone... was sitting right next to it.

CSo I won’t have to dig through her clothes,” Adam thought, feeling more than a little disappointed. He picked up his phone, and looked at the time. 4:40 PM. He looked over at the pile of clothes, and saw a lacy pink bra sitting just underneath Sarah’s gray sweater.

He grabbed the bra, held it to his face, and breathed in. It smelled just like her. His dick grew harder in his pants... and he heard a door open.

C...and so I said, where would you even get a pizza like that?” It was Sarah’s voice. They were done early.

Fuck.

Adam dropped the bra, and ran. Just before the girls turned the corner, he made his way into the shower- no one ever used these showers. As long as he stayed quiet...

Sarah walked with her friend Jenny over to the benches. They were talking about their friends or something, when Sarah noticed two things; Adam’s phone was gone, and her bra had been dropped on the ground. She smiled.

Meanwhile, Adam was somehow even redder than before. He stood only 5 feet from Sarah and Jenny, just behind the wall. And he was feeling... weird. A tingling sensation was rising through his whole body, and it was centering around his crotch. His boner was only getting harder, when he heard Sarah start talking.

CHey Jenny, would you mind looking at my boobs for a minute?”

Adam froze. His dick did not.

CUh... yeah sure. Why though?” said Jenny, cheerfully, if a bit confused.

CI thought I saw a red mark on it...” she said, pulling up her swimsuit top. CDo you see anything?”

CNo, not here,” said Jenny. CHere, let me take a look at the other one.”

Listening to Sarah talk about her boobs was not helping Adam ignore the increasingly strong sensation in his crotch. He was getting hornier by the second, and felt like he was about to explode.

CWhatever, I guess it was nothing. Let’s go get changed.” Sarah and Jenny walked away, toward the changing rooms.

Adam couldn’t hold back. He grabbed his dick and started jerking himself off. But the tingling sensation didn’t subside as he tried to relieve himself, it just got stronger and stronger.

Adam was so caught up in trying to find release that he didn’t even notice his hair growing longer and longer until it touched his shoulders. He let go of his dick and ran his hands through his new hair. And then he noticed his hands. They were growing more slender, along with his arms... and the sensation in his crotch only grew.

And then the sensation spread to his nipples. It was beginning to grow so strong, he was barely even thinking. All he new was that he needed to keep pleasuring himself. He put one hand on his chest and started pinching his nipples, while his other hand jerked his increasingly small cock.

Playing with his nipples grew increasingly pleasurable as they swelled to the size of his pinky finger. Then his whole chest started swelling, expanding outward. A cup, B cub, C cup... he didn’t even notice that he had grown a pair of breasts that would outrank a solid 90% of the girls in his school. His face had grown slimmer, and his lips were more full and feminine, his mouth open and trying to hold back a moan. He grabbed a DD cup boobs in his hand and squeezed it, his nipples harder than ever.

He was slowly getting shorter, and his hips were expanding outward. His formerly square build had become a proper hourglass figure, his hips flaring out into thick thighs. His ass swelled as well, jiggling as he jerked his tiny dick.

The pleasure was mounting, and he was about to explode. With one last pinch of his nipple he was sent over the edge. His cock spurt cum halfway across the room as Adam shook with pleasure. The last of his tiny dick shrunk into his body, forming a smooth pussy in its place.

She breathed heavily, still in aftershock of the events of the previous few minutes. She quivered a little and looked at her body in the reflection of a mirror.

Adams clothes had been replaced by new ones, a cute outfit wrapped tightly around her curvy body. A low cut top showed cleavage that Adam would have once loved to see. She was still dazed, when she heard a voice behind her.

CWell, I’m going home.”

CAlright Jenny, seeya. I’m gonna hang around here for a minute, I think there’s something I forgot to grab.”

Adam... was she still Adam? Breathed heavily as Sarah rounded the corner into the shower room.

CHot. Damn,” said Sarah, eyeing up Adam’s new body.

CWh... what happened to me?” Said CAdam”, breathing heavily.

COh, nothing much. Just a little reality rewriting spell I put on my bra, in case you, you know... couldn’t help yourself.” She grinned at her. CLooks like I was right! I gotta say, if I knew that spell would work so well, I might have done it on myself! How do you feel, Amanda?”

CReality... spell... Amanda?” Amanda panted.

CWell, let’s start from the beginning. I’m a witch. My whole family is witches. And every witch needs to pair with another witch at some point or another... but I fell for you, Amanda. Only problem is, you weren’t a witch! Yet. But we’ve fixed that, haven’t we? I needed you to, uh... pleasure yourself for the transformation to take effect, so what better place than the locker room?”

CI... I’m a witch?” Amanda said, exhaustedly. CCan I... do magic? Magic is real?”

CWell, with a little training of course. I’m sure I can help you with that. Oh, and don’t worry about your old family. I’ve written you out of existence, so they’ll never know you were gone.”

Amanda looked down at her feminine hands, at her new boobs and curves. She couldn’t believe what she was seeing! She couldn’t believe how strange it felt, but... also how right it felt.

CAre you okay? If you really really really want, I can turn you back and erase your memory. Although, I’d be pretty sad to do that. Also, I’m bad at erasing memories.”

CNo,” said Amanda. CI... I think I want to be a witch with you.”

CWell then,” said Sarah, Cyou’ve got a lot to learn. Let’s go make some more people happy, shall we?”
