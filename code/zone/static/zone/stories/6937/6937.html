<p>Faye and Jessica's Apartment</p>
<p>Jessica</p>
<p>Unwound, bare to an apartment that still felt too new and too cozy,
Jessica heaved into her frustration with a blasting sigh.</p>
<p>Her nappy, tight curls seemed all the tighter to her --- everything felt
like piano wire being tuned by some sick psychopath. She threw her head
into her couch. "Fuck," she swore, barely audible. When the word didn't
avail her of her angst, she repeated it louder, with enough resentment
to make the walls in her living room form goosebumps. "FUCK!"</p>
<p>"What? You're home?"</p>
<p>Jessica did <em>not</em> want any company, even if that company was one who was
contractually obligated to stay with her as a fellow tenant.</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm home," Jessica opened her green eyes toward the bedroom door
to her right.</p>
<p>The nightstand light was on, a sign of life despite the previous
stillness, and accompanying the revelation that Jessica was not alone, a
foxy broad slinked onto the linoleum floor. The woman, seven years more
experienced, entitled beyond what should be legal, and jobless to boot,
was still in the loose pink tee that Jessica had left her in.
Accompanying it were a pair of fuzzy pajama bottoms which were cute that
morning, insight blurred by exhaustion, brain fog, and a latent anxiety
about lateness for work, but infuriating now that Faye was still in them
a whole workday later.</p>
<p>"Why?" Jessica instigated, a stack of chips on her shoulder tall enough
to scratch the ceiling. "Is there a problem with me being here, in the
place I rent? I certainly hope not."</p>
<p>"Rough day at work, huh?" Faye came around and sat on the cream loveseat
perpendicular to the couch Jessica was at. Her steps were all on her
toes as if walking on water, and when she sat, there was a gentleness to
it.</p>
<p>"Of course. Everyday is rough when you hate your job. But even <em>my</em>
shitty job would be tolerable if I didn't have to pull double shifts
every day. . ." Jessica's aggression was angled square at Faye's lithe,
vulnerable neck. "Rent is due. Where is your half? Hmm?"</p>
<p>Faye knowingly closed her blue eyes, shook her head, and folded her
hands; painted nails over recently lotioned skin. "Baby, I told you I'd
be able to help you with rent this month and I meant it. You sound like
you don't believe me."</p>
<p>"I don't."</p>
<p>"Ouch. Okay, well I'll have you know that I already sent the landlord my
share and she's already sent a text verifying she received it." Faye
fished a phone from the strap of her bra. She took her sweet time too,
rolling her delicate fingers over her skin from one cup to the next,
playing up her show till she caught Jessica fighting her urge to stare.
Forty uncomfortable seconds later, she said, "Ahh, there it is. It
warmed up to body temperature so I couldn't feel where it'd shifted to-.
. ."</p>
<p>"Forget it," Jessica mumbled.</p>
<p>"You. . . don't want to see the text? I've really got it, I swear. I'll
be just a minute turning my phone on-. . ."</p>
<p>"I'm fucking done with your game, Faye. I'm on to it. I've already
talked to the landlord and I know how much you <em>didn't</em> give her. You're
making a fool of yourself trying to keep up this lie." Jessica's
rage-fueled her voice cranked uncontrollably louder. "You didn't give
her anything because you don't <em>have</em> anything --- because you tell me
you're going to get a job to help pay bills while you work on your
failing business. Instead, you sit on your ass all day and your business
is <em>still</em> failing! You've had four months of free ass living." Jessica
jumped from her seat, body cocked like a weapon, tongue poised with
threats. "And it's time you either pay the hell up or get the hell out."</p>
<p>"Jessy? Sweety, calm down!" Faye was on her feet too. Her voice
trembling with fear. "Listen, I know you're pissed but we won't fix this
if we can't be adults about it."</p>
<p>"Pay. Up. That's how we fix it!"</p>
<p>"I will. Tonight." Faye presented herself a virgin to the beast in
Jessica, even if she was anything but. She made herself small, clutching
at Jessica's chest as she came forward, twitching with the fear of god.
Jessica was immediately suspicious. "Come on, sit down. I have some good
news for you if you'll listen."</p>
<p>"Bitch, I told you to stop!" Jessica took the feather-light hands on her
blue polo and threw them away, distancing herself. "I'm not letting you
freeload anymore --- I don't give a fuck how cute you think you are."</p>
<p>"Jessica! I'm not freeloading," Faye said, even though her styled hair
made for a clear indication that her rent money was going to cosmetics
instead of the lease. "Listen! I just got this massive hit on my website
--- my biggest order yet. Once I fill it, I'll have enough for rent and
more. Much more!"</p>
<p>"How much?" Jessica's teeth were grinding together, eyes sharp enough to
cut.</p>
<p>"Thirty-five hundred. It's more than enough for rent. And, I was
actually thinking, since you've been so supportive of my dream, we could
let you pick us out some mountain bikes and we could take a weekend in
the mountains. You've wanted that forever, haven't you?"</p>
<p>Jessica was not convinced. Faye had 'big orders' before that promised
thousands of bucks in a week's time and all of them fell through. Either
she couldn't fill the order, or they weren't willing to wait. It had
Jessica suspicious of whether or not the orders had been real in the
first place as Faye was not above bending the truth --- to the point of
snapping --- to spare her an extra week of wrath.</p>
<p>The two lived at odds but things hadn't always been so antagonistic.
Faye actually had a corporate job a little over a year before. She was
clean cut, primed for promotion, and trustworthy enough to lure a
newly-moved-out Jessica into splitting a housing bill to make things
affordable. Fifteen months after that decision, though, Faye began to
chase the entrepreneurial spirit and sacrificed everything to get her
brainchild business off the ground. The burden of bills fell exclusively
on Jessica who had trusted Faye like a fool, but now that she had the
greatest monetary stake in their shared apartment, Jessica started to
believe that Faye needed to contribute more than pixie dust and promises
about the future success of her new business.</p>
<p>"There's no way you fill that order --- even if it exists, which I don't
think it does."</p>
<p>Jessica believed her words. Still, work made her weary and her feelings
ached for a break. It disgusted her that she had hope, but she found it
glittering naively at the bottom of her murky lake of a heart.</p>
<p>Then silence came, which Jessica couldn't deal well with. Faye was
watching her, reading her expressions like a gypsy reading a palm ---
placing the burden of words on the aggressor. It was working. Jessica
felt her need to speak in the awkwardness and her incompetence at
standing up for herself made her near certain that she'd not said what
she meant. Already, by this one shift in conversational tempo, she felt
herself on the defensive.</p>
<p>She kept her fire from going out and hefted heavy hands on her hips.
"Hear me? There's no order. Now pay up."</p>
<p>"Oh no? He gave me a grand in advance as an act of good faith. This is
no chump of a business partner. He's the real deal. He knows that he's
not just buying my product --- he's buying me!" After being shooed away,
Faye came in close again. When Jessica didn't immediately thrust her
across the room again, she made a scene of really holding each of
Jessica's features in her gaze. "Now, I'm not saying I can do this
alone. I'm going to need some capable hands to help me manage
everything. I <em>could</em> hire a few helpers, but if we really wanted to
make the best decision for <em>us</em>, it would be smarter to handle it
ourselves."</p>
<p>Jessica snarled. She didn't shy away from Faye whose knees were bumping
into hers, whose recent shower scent roared obnoxiously in the narrow
gap between their faces, but she did tilt her head away when Faye meant
to taste her. "Three and a half grand is a huge order. You'll never fill
it. It's impossible," Jessica declared, indignation already abating.</p>
<p>The logistics were just wrong. Jessica knew she shouldn't believe even
if there was a universe in which Faye had an order that wasn't so
ludicrously huge because Faye was not against betraying trust to buy
herself time. Unfortunately, Jessica's logic was in constant conflict
with the co-pilot of her behavior: raw, unadulterated sexual passion. It
was hard having the war between wanting to kick Faye out of the
apartment and onto her useless ass while never being able to get said
ass out of her waking mind.</p>
<p>"I already explained to him that it would have to be shipped in batches
over a few weeks. And --- at least, this is what I figure --- with <em>you</em>
helping me," Faye shot heart-shaped arrows with her unnaturally
iridescent irises. "I'll have extra motivation to make this work. Plus,
once I get to the production size to accommodate this order, I'll have
the scale to take on even more. This deal can only benefit us. I'm
thinking we are debt free in six months --- you could quit your job
since you hate it so much."</p>
<p>Faye's fingers found something to play with in the collar of Jessica's
work top. One slender, purposeful finger ran sprints toward the 'V' and
bumped suggestively against the button there that barred Jessica's
generous chest as well as her sense of relaxation.</p>
<p>Faye continued. "We buy our own place in a year, we start a family
together, and we're damned wealthy before we're thirty five. We can live
independently --- nobody can ever tell us what to do or what's right.
The only responsibility we'll have is to ourselves."</p>
<p>If anyone could articulate Jessica's desires so adequately, it was Faye.
She played her vision for the future like a concert clarinetist playing
a solo, the sight of which sent Jessica on her own personal journey
through the willow trees on her own ranch, to the Italian style home on
one-hundred acres. Jessica badly wanted a kitchen where she could
improve her culinary skill; passions for cooking were currently stunted
by diner work. She was too tired when she got home to cook, meaning that
she'd technically sacrificed her dream of being a chef to Faye. Was it
now possible that Faye was giving it back?</p>
<p>The house would have a bathroom that didn't require a plumber to visit
every few weeks, a patio to be sat on, a corgi and a border collie, a
vegetable garden. . . And finally, a bedroom where a voluptuous,
amour-minded, artfully nude Faye was reclined with a martini glass.</p>
<p>Wistful desire reflected plainly in Jessica's eyes as Faye described it
all; exactly as she'd dreamed, not a detail spared. Without a roommate,
Jessica could earn enough on her own to save and make it happen. But
without a roommate, Faye would not be waiting naked and curvy for her
and a crown jewel of her fantasy would be missing.</p>
<p>It wasn't easy, but the darker diner worker couldn't resist any longer.
She just couldn't keep fighting --- even if the road rage she exhibited
driving home proved she had a great deal of ire about the home she was
driving to. "One thousand in advance?" Jessica's defined chin went low.
She held Faye's gaze.</p>
<p>"Yup. It's amazing, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Why didn't you spend it on rent?"</p>
<p>"I wanted to show you first --- mostly because I want us to spend it
together," Faye had worked her way through two of Jessica's button,
flaying open her shirt to where her skin was a lighter tone, less
colored by the sun. There, a natural swell of chest was directed up and
out by a bra that had been purchased to increase tip revenue, but also
served to delight a celebratory woman like Faye. "As far as I'm
concerned, I owe it to you because I'd be utterly lost without your
support. You get the first fruits; use it however you like."</p>
<p>"I'll just use it on. . ."</p>
<p>"Rent? I know, baby, I know. But <em>after</em> that. . .?"</p>
<p>Jessica shrugged, despite knowing a million things that needed fixing,
renovating, replacing, and renewing.</p>
<p>Overwhelmed, she focused on Faye who exhibited an emotion that made her
heart flip. It wasn't cruel; just superior and triumphant. Casual
dominance, Jessica thought, the cocky kind that shows she thinks she can
get away with anything. It made the shower scent sour a bit to see it,
but Jessica's heart was already open; her rebellion already stymied. She
signed into their shared dream together, choosing to believe it because
it was easy and she didn't have to argue or fight while completely
drained to make it happen.</p>
<p>Faye, detecting little to no opposition, fueled by the satisfaction of
taming her girlfriend's temper, depressed her hand into Jessica's jeans
over the hips till her partner's knees gave and she, willingly, <em>very
willingly</em>, took a seat at the couch. Looking down on her, Faye's lips
played upward as her blonde hair was shaken out. "I could make a few
recommendations." Her words were a slow massage. Hands went to her own
clothing, working the top around a bit in a strip tease. She pulled it
down, crumpled it in her hands, grunted as if any fabric covering her
body were a sin and a curse. All the while Faye's chest was the center
of everything due to its attractive, oversized quality; plenteous even
on a woman with a frame that was full of life and volume.</p>
<p>"We go north to Midtown, spend the weekend away, enjoying the
late-autumn nights. We have an exclusive, romantic dinner with seafood
and all the wine we can drink. Then, once it gets too chilly to be out,
we retire to a suite at a not-to-ritzy hotel and we do. . . well, we do
what we do best," Faye giggled, the bottom hem of her top suspending the
weight of her enormous bosom from below. "And I don't intend on letting
you leave bed till you've fully satisfied me. You'll take off from work
so that won't be an excuse --- and I'll raise hell to make it happen,
too; whatever I have to do to get unedited time with you."</p>
<p>Jessica crossed her legs, then her arms, and chuckled. "Don't be too
hard on them. Stuffy's still pays the bills."</p>
<p>Faye, incapable of letting Jessica's defense last, stopped jiggling her
tits for two seconds and snatched Jessica's hands from her elbows where
they were loosely wrapped. Their fingers intertwined, cotton white and
premium leather, as Faye lowered herself, just as gently as she had on
the loveseat, into Jessica's lap. She didn't come full on and she didn't
straddle. She elected a perpendicular approach that allowed her to lace
herself around Jessica's neck like the fine jewellery she believed
herself to be. Her legs reached all the way to the end and over the
couch side.</p>
<p>When Jessica didn't immediately reach, Faye snatched her roommate's
caramel hand and placed it under her pink shirt directly over her navel.
With a brief pause accounting for some degree of apprehension, Jessica
began to move that hand in circles which Faye rewarded with a sigh and a
laborious blink that highlighted her long lashes.</p>
<p>"As far as I'm concerned, anything that keeps us away from this," she
gestured to their current arrangement, clearly also bringing attention
to where it was bound to lead. "Needs to be rid from our lives at our
earliest convenience."</p>
<p>Jessica swallowed a lump in her throat. Her buttons were all undone, but
she couldn't help but feel a heat building behind her breasts. It became
uncomfortable to be clothed. Still, she grappled one last time with the
logistics of her situation. "Faye," the taste of her lover's name felt
exotic as it only seemed to be useful in moments of intense anger or
orgasm. "How much are you going to need me to help you?"</p>
<p>"You work hard, so not every waking hour, obviously. When you're home
and on the weekends when you can. I'll be on a really strict schedule
and my diet will definitely need some cleaning up."</p>
<p>"What kind of schedule?"</p>
<p>Faye looked to fall in love all over again once Jessica showed interest
in her and the intimate details of her daily work. "Every four hours or
so. It'll be hectic, babe, I tell ya." Huge, succulent lips planted a
lingering kiss on Jessica's cheek, fully extending Faye's body to reach.
"My sleep will suffer for sure, but it's the only way to both up
production and meet the demand."</p>
<p>"How. . . can I help?" Jessica, for the first time in the night, looked
directly and exclusively at Faye out of sheer reverence and admiration.</p>
<p>With that, all of the contention, the threats, and the swears were gone.
One look at her situation, and Jessica knew she'd accepted defeat. When
she was young, she never would have settled on losing, but maturing a
bit bought wisdom. Surrender that was tactical was okay. Still, while
heating up for some awesome after-work sex with her woman, Jessica
couldn't help but feel she lost a lot with Faye. Happy future wife,
happy life. Maybe that rule applied. But she felt uncomfortable
suppressing her resentment for the upteenth time in their relationship.</p>
<p><em>Just make love with her</em>, Jessica told herself, <em>lose yourself in this
gorgeous, ambitious woman of yours and stay positive.</em></p>
<p>Meanwhile, doubt pervaded her. Faye seemed to know she'd won. She could
ask for whatever she wanted and she would get it; could do as she
pleased and not be judged. The threat of being kicked out was
extinguished as it had been six other times in recent memory and no
recourse would be taken because Jessica lost her fire when she needed it
most.</p>
<p>The liberation freed Faye's spirit and this freedom was nothing new for
her. She'd been gaining freedoms, earning favors, winning at life, for
as long as she\'d drawn breath. A people person, a rapport builder, a
seductress, the lead saleswoman --- all aliases Faye could stake her
very life on.</p>
<p>Was it alright to just let that be? Jessica questioned that more with
each passing day.</p>
<p>__________</p>
<p>That night, Faye showed Jessica exactly how she could 'help'.</p>
<p>"Isn't this just sex?" Jessica whispered.</p>
<p>Below her, between her plump thighs, golden hair reflected moonlight.
"Sex helps, Jessy," Faye winked. "Or maybe it doesn\'t. Are you
seriously going to ask me to stop?"</p>
<p>Finger pads felt like ghost pleasure on her outer lips. One
investigative press released a flow of built up pleasure.</p>
<p>"I'm usually so composed. Then I see how wet you are and I lose myself
completely." Faye licked her lips so they glistened with equitable
moisture to Jessica's leaking snatch.</p>
<p>"Then do it," Jessica said on an inhale.</p>
<p>"I was going to hold out; let you suffer some."</p>
<p>"Please." Thighs spread even wider. A tentative hand extended to touch
Faye, grasping for whatever was necessary to initiate this oral
stimulation. "I've suffered enough lately. Just be my escape right now."</p>
<p>"Very well."</p>
<p>Faye moved as slow as shadows being shifted in moonlight. When Jessica
felt lips at her warm femininity she quaked at the fresh and familiar
pleasure. Her body rolled back and then into it. She let her mind drift
and lived exclusive in her body, not even an inch beneath her own skin.
Everything felt so good, she could barely identify what was being done.
Velvety softness bumped her outsides, a cunning serpent hooked her
insides. Nails played on the sensitive skin of her inner thighs and a
nose scrunched on her hooded pleasure peak.</p>
<p>It couldn't have been ten minutes till she came the first time. Her
friendly stars danced over her vision and she felt tension flushing away
from her.</p>
<p>The next thing she knew, Faye was coming onto the bed to join her. From
nose to chin, her model face dripped with fresh girl cum --- Jessica's
own, which was simply too sexy a feeling to describe. Having a woman
wear her marking with pride and confidence stole Jessica's very breath.</p>
<p>They made out some more, the newness of orgasm flavoring this comfort
zone in white heat. The grinding of parts together and emblazoned
foreplay seemed nearly to lead to yet another blatant sexual act.
Imagine the surprise when Faye slowed the tempo.</p>
<p>Then, with endorphins peaked, with emotional connectedness in its apex
form she manufactured a case from beneath their bed and revealed a set
of bottles as its contents.</p>
<p>With initial apprehensions gone, Jessica was introduced formally to
Faye's method.</p>
<p>In passing, by nature of their varied sexual play, Jessica had
encountered Faye's namestake. She'd even been a quality assurance
advisor unknowingly in the past. But now, the context was different;
money was to be made.</p>
<p>Faye's premium product was her breast milk. And it was high time Jessica
be in the know about her lover's business.</p>
<p>When it was first presented, the idea was outlandish. Faye defended the
idea with studies, research, and hundreds of online testimonials. No,
she didn't have to be pregnant. Yes, people would pay money for it. Yes,
people would pay a <em>lot</em> of money for it. And, finally, yes, it would
make her tits bigger. Precisely because it was too foreign a topic,
Jessica avoided it and only ran across Faye's progress coincidentally
when she just so happened to have Faye's nipple between her lips. Faye's
enormous pillowy breasts were already the leading attraction to her
theme park of a body and Jessica considered herself damned lucky to be
sleeping with a woman that had so much to offer. She just. . . didn't
expect breast milk to be a thing.</p>
<p>Who could <em>ever</em> expect it?</p>
<p>"Just do what you're always thinking about doing anyway," Faye said.</p>
<p>Their position changed. Jessica's back was to the headboard. Faye's back
was to the tan girl's chest. From some plastic tub beneath their bed, an
array of twelve ounce bottles had been produced. Glass, expensive
looking, and wide-rimmed with golden lids.</p>
<p>"I'm currently thinking of how your every move sends your skin across my
nipples," Jessica mumbled. "And how distracting it is to learn how to
milk anything with my own boobs wanting attention."</p>
<p>"You know the expression: you milk my boobs and I'll pinch your nipples
till their so raw you can't even wear clothes tomorrow."</p>
<p>Jessica moaned, disarmed at the thought.</p>
<p>"Usually, you warm them up," Faye pulled her blonde hair to the side so
Jessica could look over her shoulder. "Except we did a good job of that
earlier. So now you take an underhanded grip and gently apply pressure
with your thumb, rolling toward the nipple."</p>
<p>Being a little shorter, it was hard for the curly-haired girl to see.
The blonde rolled to the right, putting Jessica's face beside her
shoulder as she kissed her caramel cheek. "Better?"</p>
<p>Jess nodded. "Are you sure you trust me to do this?"</p>
<p>"You're the only person in the world I trust to do this. . ."</p>
<p>A light hand guided a softer one to Faye's right breast. It felt full
and taut and so alive; energetic almost. Faye was known to lie about
things, but her exceptionally superior tits were everything Jessica knew
them to be. At least that could be trusted.</p>
<p>Faye's free hand held the bottle as the shorter lover concentrated a
little too hard on trying to be perfect. The blonde's 34F cup tits were
too big to be handled in one girl's palm, but Jessica did her best to
follow instructions.</p>
<p>First stroke. Nothing was produced other than a nagging sexual itch.
Second stroke made Faye purr and nibble at the younger girl's ear lobe.
The third squeeze was rougher, pinching the smooth, pink areola till
four visible lines ejected out and filled the bottle nearly a quarter of
the way.</p>
<p>"They're so full. I thought they might pop for you," Faye teased.</p>
<p>"Fuck it --- babe, I need it again."</p>
<p>The blonde giggled. Jessica's sex drive was immense! The bottle went to
the nightstand while the two love birds found heaven in their sheets
once more. Youthful, beautiful curves battered each other. They spread
love with each touch ending with a switch in position to sixty-nine.
Each were talented enough to get the other off, or perhaps just
compatible as any couple might hope to be.</p>
<p>Once they both stopped spasming, Faye surfaced beside Jessica to cuddle.</p>
<p>"Sorry," Jess whispered.</p>
<p>"I needed it too." Faye panted, clearly satisfied. "Worse than I thought
I did. So don't apologize. I like that you push me sexually."</p>
<p>Jess felt amazing hearing that. She always considered herself weird for
being a girl with such a huge libido. If she wasn't working or otherwise
busy, chances were she was thinking about who she could bone.</p>
<p>"I don't know, I've had people complain," Jessica curled into Faye's
hair.</p>
<p>"Are you fishing for a compliment? It sounds like you want me to stroke
your pussy and tell you it's okay to like having marathon sex."</p>
<p>Jess smiled. "Would you?"</p>
<p>"If we can fill two bottles --- which isn't much, by the way --- I'll
tell you how much I've enjoyed sex since we've started dating. Promise.
I might even write you a book on it."</p>
<p>The frizzy-haired partner groaned like a kid waking up for school on a
Monday. "Deal."</p>
<p>Then, after some labored adjusting, the two resumed a relaxed milking
position. Jessica began again, the slippery art of manipulating another
person's body to some strange new end. It was kinda like masturbating
but she had to trust Faye completely to tell her if she was doing things
right.</p>
<p>By the relief after having milked twenty-four ounces, Jessica knew that
would be her main problem: trusting Faye. They nipped and kneaded and
smooched the night away till all of Jessica's tank was empty and fell
asleep in each other's arms. The very last thought in the brown girl's
mind was her girlfriend's habit of lying and how the untouched sanctuary
of carnal pleasures was being infiltrated by the practice of milking.</p>
<p>_____</p>
<p>Faye and Jessica's Apartment.</p>
<p>Two Weeks Later</p>
<p>Faye</p>
<p>Jessica was falling into a habit.</p>
<p>Faye had navigated all of her girlfriend's other barriers with relative
ease. Anger was easily dispensed with as was stress from work. Faye
couldn't have imagined sex to be the major stumbling block to overcome.</p>
<p>But it was. The caramel-toned girl would come in and do the bare minimal
amount of milking each night and rush to have sex. It was clearly a hang
up in the plan. Faye was never going to get as big as she needed as
quickly as she needed by milking minimal quantities once per day. There
had to be a solution.</p>
<p>It was one such night. The couple had done about thirty-six ounces and
were asleep together in bed. Except, Faye couldn't sleep --- wouldn't,
so long as this issue persisted. She cupped her boobies in a curled
position. They had grown, sure, but not much. A cup size or two. Not
nearly enough. Over an hour ago, they'd been milked and were already
near half full again; the production was there but not strong enough to
actual make her grow.</p>
<p>Why wasn't Jessica into milking her? There was no excitement in her
hands anymore. The process was mechanical for the both of them, as
pleasant as having her tit slammed in a car door. Faye felt a scowl on
her face, rolling her palms along her prodigious swells. It didn't
matter how much she flirted or moaned or encouraged. Jessica went near
unresponsive while they milked; the human equivalent to a milk pump.</p>
<p>Faye felt like the victim.</p>
<p>Jessica had no excuse to be so useless, no reason to act dead with a
girlfriend as amazing as Faye knew she was. It made Faye's imagination
stir for a solution that would enliven Jessica before she became nothing
more than a cold set of hands. So, as she felt her tits filling with
milk, bigger and bigger beneath the sheets, she devised a plan.</p>
<p>See, in all her experience, Faye knew how people worked. Occasionally, a
plan could be worked out by talking. More often, people did what they
were compelled to do; compelled by a person who knows what's best. She
considered herself just that type: the person who always knew best.
Jessica rarely saw her plan for what it was. Her girlfriend always
accused her of lying, fibbing, or playing games. Poor Jessy just
couldn't see.</p>
<p>The blonde crafted a new method and waited for several hours; skipping
her midnight milking. She told herself she could wait and resolved to
muscle through how her body revved up at midnight. Her tits had adapted
to a four hour milking schedule which was good. It just wasn't good when
she didn't milk every four hours. The lactating woman squirmed for
hours. Just beneath her skin, milk flooded her milk ducts. Grander she
grew, pale white milkers growing bigger and bigger in her hands.</p>
<p>It was so hard to wait. Faye tweaked her nipples ever so gently and
still found herself panting in moans, finding no relief. Hours later,
she was a jittery, near-orgasmic wreck. Her boobs and milk weren't
stopping. Her hands felt skin stretching beneath them. On her back, two
hills pushed the gossamer sheets higher into the air. Silently, she
wished they would just come crashing down --- just be squishy and jiggly
like normal boobs. But she didn't have normal boobs anymore.</p>
<p>Four hours was long enough to come to terms with her fright, though. Her
tits were stuffed with milk and wouldn't stop even when the nervous
energy branched into pleasure and pain. Her steadied breath was forcing
them higher and higher. They were too sensitive to touch unless she
wanted to cum which didn't stop her from playing with fire even a
little. She had to see if they were really so wide, so tall, and so
taut.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of four hours, Faye paused the alarm before it could
sound. Off came the sheets. With night adjusted eyes, she saw her
beauties standing proudly below her. "Four hours of agony did me pretty
well. . ."</p>
<p>One last palming of her boobs made her vision swim with bliss; a
startling amount of pain in her pleasure. She was bigger than ever
before. Exciting, since now she knew she only needed skip a milking to
reach her new size. But not right away. Those four hours had been their
own unique edge game of hell and she wasn't sure she wanted to think
about putting off satisfaction for a while. Her puppies were too big and
gorgeous to be ignored. A finger tested a new ridge, a vein rising
briefly to the surface near her right nipple. Talk about overfilled.
Based only on size, she put herself a few cup sizes larger; at least J
cup range. But the mass wasn't right at all. They were too dense,
dragging her chest downward like a backpack worn on her front.</p>
<p>"God, I'm too sensitive," Faye said, realizing that too much excess
movement was all it would take for her to start a water war with heavy
cream.</p>
<p>Then, she turned her attentions to her sleeping lover. With deftness she
straddled Jessica's waist and beheld the upward facing, open-mouthed
breathing. It was so dopey and cute without an inkling of awareness.
Jessica was cute when she was fully herself. Faye wished she would act
that way during the milkings.</p>
<p>"She will after this."</p>
<p>Careful not to fall, she lowered each hand to each side of the brown
girl's pillow. The blond's tits were huge and dangled low. A centimeter
lower and her pap would have swiped the tip of a nose. Once her weighty
chest stopped swaying, she stilled her rushing heart to have full
control of how her milk-laden booby descended. For a flash, she went
over her plan a final time. Then she felt her hormones raging and her
body being dragged toward the dry, empty mouth.</p>
<p>Thank goodness Jessica slept like a rock --- from working double shifts
and going on bike rides and fucking for several hours a night. Any other
person might have been awakened instantly as the larger woman's prime
ass spread over her stomach, or how a stifled moan filled the room, or
how instantaneously milk was let down from a pent up breast into the
open mouth. Jessica hardly flinched.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Faye had never felt so alive! At first, she was taken aback
by the awkwardness of a different mouth being on her leaking mammary.
But she kept tempo admirably. The biggest, most sensitive version of her
breasts were finally being tended to in her girlfriend's mouth.</p>
<p>In went her erect, pink nipple. Then went the flesh behind it, then the
flesh behind that. A high density traffic jam occurred as she stuffed
herself into Jessica's open maw. Then, her flesh spread outward to
Jessica's chin, cheeks, and nose. Before Faye made it as far down as she
wanted, she was already smothering Jessica with a single tit!</p>
<p>"Oh-ho, my. . .," Faye swooned. All her skin sparked, shooting pleasure
like lasers through her veins, bending bliss in the direction of her
breast. It felt amazing in Jessica's mouth, so wet and warm, and her
nipple twitched with life just before it laced the back of Jessica's
throat with a backed up parcel of lady cream. The unexpectedly heavy
dose sent Faye swimming, so she surrendered to the feel of releasing her
overcharged batteries into a worthy, vacant source.</p>
<p>Like a storm, not five seconds later, Jessica heaved thick coughs that
spangled dots of Faye's morning milk on the front of the very tits that
had produced it. She bucked herself, tossing and turning, but Faye was
the larger woman in height and size. All Jessica's thrashing, choking,
and yelling did was make a bigger mess of already messy sheets.</p>
<p>"Morning, sweetums," Faye felt her composure had already slipped from
its usual place. It was hard to do anything but moan when her left titty
was dribbling two milking's worth of milk.</p>
<p>"Wh-what the f-fuck! Th-the hell were yo-. . ." Jessica broke to clear
her throat violently. "I feel like d-death!"</p>
<p>"Oh come now. . ."</p>
<p>"I almost drowned in. . . i-in. . ." Jessica smacked her lips, realizing
what she was tasting. Two fingers went to her lips. "You're crazy."</p>
<p>"Maybe, but you <em>liked</em> it. You started suckling a little before you
woke up," Faye said, weaving in seeds of her will. Jessica hadn't really
sucked so much as she tried to inhale a normal breath which was
interrupted by several ounces of yummy milk. Complimentary to Faye's
plan, though, Jessica never had to know that.</p>
<p>By the look Jessica made, Faye knew her words had effect.</p>
<p>"Get off," Jessica grumbled.</p>
<p>"I'm trying to, but you won't suck my titties-. . ."</p>
<p>"You know what I mean."</p>
<p>"Of course, but me knowing is what makes this so fun," Faye giggled.
Having all the power in her position, her fingers started squeezing at
her waist and began to ascend up the terrific mountains that had grown
over the course of a few hours. "Do you see? They look so full right
now. I'm fucking enormous."</p>
<p>"I see," Jessica tried not to look interested. Faye was dominating her
field of view, though, so there was nothing to look at <em>but</em> her groping
herself. "They do look a bit. . . full."</p>
<p>"Just 'a bit'?" Faye frowned with adorable duck lips. "Cause I think
they're about to pop. Ugh, I feel so stupid for sleeping through that
alarm," the blond lied without skipping a beat.</p>
<p>"Slept through. . . wait, what time is it?"</p>
<p>"Four. I slept through the last one on accident, hehe," Faye made
emphasis of how full her breasts were with milk by depressing their tops
with each finger individually. Her skin bounced back forcefully, all
comfortable squishiness gone from them. "Guess I was more tired than I
thought. You <em>really</em> let me have it last night, though. 'Not sure if I
should blame you or thank you."</p>
<p>Jessica was too easy. A few compliments and her annoyance was blown
away, as routine as dusting a bookshelf or wiping a dirty window clean.
"Damn. . . we just missed that one milking?" she asked with a smirk.</p>
<p>Faye felt like a goddess. Jessica was obviously mad with lust, eyes
sticking to her stuffed gourds. "Yup, just one. My production is kicking
up so we can't afford to miss too many in a row. Otherwise, there's no
telling how <em>huge</em> I'll get."</p>
<p>"You're already huge. . ." Jessica's hands found purchase on her blonde
partner's thighs.</p>
<p>"And you love it."</p>
<p>Jessica shrugged in surrender. "I'm a simple woman. . ."</p>
<p>Faye laughed to flatter. She scooted herself back a space or so to allow
Jessica to rise at her middle. Face to face, they soaked each other in.
Jessica had to take extra time to soak since there was noticeably more
mass to account for. As if including another sensor would improve her
examination, her hands rose like twins in the direction of Faye's
nipples.</p>
<p>Faye panicked. If she let Jessica touch her, she'd cum immediately. She
couldn't afford to lose control yet.</p>
<p>The older girl caught tan hands mid flight. Her tits remained ungroped,
but they shook violently from the jerk reaction which made them both
leak profusely, dribbling down Faye's soft, lithe body.</p>
<p>"I was thinking," Faye bit her cheek to remain composed. "O-one milking
isn't so bad, you know? Like, I only gained like three cup sizes? Maybe
four. . . the point is," she laced fingers with Jessica. "I don't want
us getting in a habit of it. If we aren't consistent, we're delaying my
growth and our money. So, we need to do something to make sure we never
forget this lesson."</p>
<p>"What did you have in mind?"</p>
<p>Faye beheld her love, her partner, her passion. Jessica had a body to be
proud of; naturally slim with a wealth of boobage of her own. She was
naturally caramel colored all around and her nipples were the color of
saltwater taffy. There were few things as wonderful in the world as
looking at Jessica and knowing that she'd do her everything to please
and satisfy. Faye felt this surge of power making eye contact with the
emeralds of Jessica's eyes, power that she couldn't help but wield in a
boob-related fashion.</p>
<p>"Well, you were pretty good at nursing. You were asleep and all, but you
seemed to know what you were doing."</p>
<p>Jessica recoiled slightly. "I don't know, Faye. Shouldn't we just do
things like always? This seems like a waste."</p>
<p>'Like always'? Faye scoffed internally. Jessica's enthusiasm about doing
things 'like always' was downright foul. Literally anything was better
than 'like always'.</p>
<p>"It's not waste, it's investment. If you drain me when I'm at this
size," Faye wobbled her torso to and fro, knowing how it eroded her iron
will but also knowing the immense, hypnotic influence huge, sexy tits
had on a sex drive like Jessica's. "I'll grow to meet the next demand
even faster. Milking by hand is too slow. We need a new way to milk
quickly."</p>
<p>"But Faye. . ."</p>
<p>"You suck my titties all the time, so there's nothing to worry about,"
it felt stupid having to remind Jessica of what she knew she loved.
"This time, there will just be a reward for both of us. Come on, you
can't tell me my milk didn't taste great."</p>
<p>Jessica scrunched her face. "How would you know how good you taste?"</p>
<p>What? Did Jessica not think her girlfriend hadn't sampled herself? How
silly! Of course she had. What other way is there to really understand
her product?</p>
<p>Faye could have responded with all of that, but it only won her one
batte. Instead, she dipped into Jessica's space and slowly began to make
out with her, ambitious to win the whole war. Their lips crashed
intentionally, swapping moisture and moans, perfectly matched like lock
and key. The further Faye leaned into it, the closer her immense
whoppers got to Jessica's body. In time, they eclipsed Jessica's own
proud breasts like they were nothing. Even with Jessica's double D's,
Faye's milk-laden mammaries overtook the opposing pair as thoroughly as
they might a girl with no rack at all. What could Jessica's chest
possibly do to contest a pair twice as large and brimming with yummy
nectar?</p>
<p>Faye waited for Jessica to breathe. Then she said, "I taste something
sweet on your lips, and it tastes <em>amazing</em>. You can't possibly tell me
you don't like it."</p>
<p>"Sweets are just. . ." Jessica tried abbreviating her hesitation with a
ravenous kiss.</p>
<p>Faye retreated flirtatiously, encouraging the bushy haired babe in front
of her to pursue. "I know you have a sweet tooth, so that's not why
you're hesitating. Could it be that you're scared? You think I'm too
much for ya? That has to be it. You don't think you can finish me off.
Not that I blame you," Faye rolled her chest up and out, walloping
Jessica's chest like airbags. She wasn't prepared for the pleasure of
going breast to breast so raw, so fast.</p>
<p>"Baby!" the caramel girl's care leaped like lightning. Her arms roped
around Faye's waist so she didn't go tumbling backward onto the bed.</p>
<p>"<em>Whoa</em>," the blond whispered at the pleasure, the shock, and the rush
of power. Her chest felt <em>alive</em>. She hated to look so vulnerable before
Jessica so she composed herself quickly. What the hell was that all
about, though? A moment of weakness followed by a feeling of. . . what
was it? She wanted to sit taller with her chest out, to have people
react to her body, to be admired. Suddenly, having hands around her
didn't feel like a vulnerability.</p>
<p>Faye levelled her gaze into the troubled eyes of her lover. "I'm
alright. You just need to drink my milk. I don't know how I know it'll
work, it just will." There was an allure about Jessica's full mouth and
soft lips. Jessica touched them with the thumbs of both hands, using her
other eight fingers to stroke her cheeks. "I thought my bad ass,
sexually voracious girlfriend would be up to the challenge. Unless I
somehow expected too much. . ."</p>
<p>The younger girl's sigh was the cherry on top. Faye was absolutely
forthright with her coaxing and she loved it. Flexing, displaying her
authority, commanding attention with her delightful body and bending
wills with her games. She felt positively twisted in all the right ways.</p>
<p>"Okay. . . alright," Jessica's eyes were green glints between the slits
of her eyes.</p>
<p>The darker partner pushed her chin out, seeking an inspirational kiss.
Faye, unsurprised but satisfied that her teasing bore fruit, savored a
slow sixty seconds of heaven against Jasmine's plump mouth. When time
elapsed, she pulled back again which prompted Jessica to chase, sticking
her neck out even further on Faye's behalf. There, they kissed again,
both giggling at the game they were playing.</p>
<p>Enough kiss and move and Faye found herself laying back to create more
space. She rolled backward onto her hips, propping herself up on her
arms. When Jessica tumbled on top of her, searching for more mouth
pleasure, her body was buffered by Faye's ridiculously swollen knockers.
It was as if they were a third and fourth partner in the foreplay, a
pair that demanded increasingly high maintenance, needing to be exalted
for their very existence.</p>
<p>"Mmm, your nipples are so hard right now," Faye mewled. "They feel so
good against me." Then, she threw a hand behind Jessica and pulled her
closer.</p>
<p>"F-fucking huge," Jessica replied, unable to keep her eagerness from her
expression. "And hard and wet."</p>
<p>"How big? Tell me how giant you think they are."</p>
<p>"The biggest I've ever seen --- ever felt, too."</p>
<p>"Admit it, they're so warm against you, aren't they? I can almost wrap
you up between them." Faye momentarily imagined being able to actually
hide a person between her tits. It spurred her flaming heart anew, and
she tucked the image away as a goal for the future while she pulled
Jessica's heart strings. "Mmm, I need something between them. . ."</p>
<p>Jessica took the hint. She used her kiss to work Faye onto her back
entirely, ministered devoutly to her mouth with her lips and tongue,
then played with a southerly course. Gasping at the taste of jawline,
she found a vein throbbing with a quickened pulse in Faye's neck. It led
her to collarbones, then disappeared as the fullness of Faye's breast
came into view.</p>
<p>"Enough t-teasing," Faye urged. Her right hand clawed into the cloud of
all-natural hair and pulled it fast to her sternum, digging Jessica's
nose in the extra padding. "Hehe, they're even bigger than your head!
Bet it feels nice down there, right? Soft and warm between my jugs?" The
pleasure rode over the pain then, making the tease all the easier even
if her nipples lobbed strands of milk point blank at the younger lover.</p>
<p>Jessica mumbled, doubling her kissing speed. On the outside, Faye's
breasts were bright and stretched to the point of seeming frail. Even
so, Jessica was guided to test their resilience and did so with
ebullience. Growling, she bit. Swooning, she licked and puffed hot
breath wherever her mouth roamed. Faye directed her, but also stifled
her efforts by closing her arms together and completely incapacitating
Jessica with the pile up of tit flesh she created.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of this, she made a point to rock her lover back and
forth, turning away from unhinged debauchery and bringing about more of
a matronly feel. "You hear that? The ocean? I bet you do, cause I can
feel them sloshing around." From peak to root, each milk-teeming giant
had white trickling lines as breast milk was forced up and out during
their play. The curtain let in muted morning light that made each
droplet of cream glow is it soaked Faye's skin and the sheets
surrounding them.</p>
<p>"They actually are. That\'s crazy," Jessica turned her chin up to
answer. She spoke from the depths of Faye's cleavage. "I've never heard
of a girl with <em>this</em> much milk. How much do babies drink?"</p>
<p>"It's about supply and demand. Mothers don't get as big as me because
their bodies think they need enough for a child or two. But this week,
my body has had to adapt to this crazy milking schedule of ours; not to
mention the months that I've been inducing on my own before this order.
If it was up to babies, I'd still be small. But thanks to <em>us</em>, well. .
."</p>
<p>Faye wiggled her eyebrows suggestively.</p>
<p>". . . you could feed a whole hospital full."</p>
<p>"Or one very thirsty girlfriend."</p>
<p>"Jeez, these are just unbelievable," Jessica tilted her head,
worshipping Faye's endowments with a sheet of kisses.</p>
<p>"You still scared? You shouldn't be. I know you'll have no problem
bottoming me out," Faye tilted her head, looking down, eyes glowing with
sky-colored care. "It's just a milkshake."</p>
<p>The bed springs sounded off as Jessica rose to pushup position, hovering
over Faye's body like a hummingbird. "'Just a milkshake'. . ."</p>
<p>"Love you, babe."</p>
<p>Jessica lowered slowly, electing the breast that she'd rejected wildly
when she awoke. "Love you too." Her lips were just out of range when
Faye tilted herself and her nipple closed the distance.</p>
<p>The couple connected. Milk began to flow. Faye could tell from the
expression that the woman above her was muscling through for the first
few swallows. It was a mental barrier she was breaking through. With a
few pets and words of encouragement, the swallowing process went all the
smoother.</p>
<p>Moods shifted, adopting a relaxed vibe. The sounds of sucking and
swallowing became meditative. Tension left both their bodies and they
could spend sweet, quiet moments together. Faye didn't like how her boob
started to lose size immediately but she did like how giddy and joyful
Jessy was as she slurped up enough cream to pudge out her cheeks. That
was all it took to be reminded of how much she loved this girl --- all
she wanted was to fix the world to make Jessy happy.</p>
<p>Again, she was right: some people took a little manipulation but once
they understood the vision, they would come onboard.</p>
<p>Jessica finished off the first breast and caught her breath before
jumping to the next. Faye noticed she was absolutely glowing. No stress,
nothing on her mind, as peaceful as she was when sleeping.</p>
<p>"You doing okay, sweet girl?" Faye asked.</p>
<p>"Jaw's a bit sore. I think I'm mostly full, too. But I'll see what I can
get from the next one."</p>
<p>"I was actually going to let you tap out if you wanted."</p>
<p>Jessica recoiled. "Seriously? But your boobies are all lopsided.
Definitely not sexy."</p>
<p>"Beg your pardon? Most girls have uneven breasts. It's a natural look!"</p>
<p>"You're right. Sorry."</p>
<p>Faye kept losing her fingers in Jessica's twisty mane of black tresses,
massaging her skalp. "That's right. You better apologize. Ungrateful
little girly."</p>
<p>The younger girl's pink tongue showed.</p>
<p>"Let's find a better position so you don't strain your jaw and let you
do what damage you can for an hour. You've gotta get to work soon. It's
already six."</p>
<p>Submissive to her leader, Jessica sat up. The two adopted a classic for
breastfeeding with the lactating girl seated casually and the nursing
girl in her lap. They each stroked each other, finding fresh love in new
practices.</p>
<p>"You're my beautiful girl," Faye's words were warm mist in the chill of
morning. "I'll do whatever I can to protect you and make you happy."</p>
<p>"I love you," Jessica pledged between swallows. "I'll support you and
never leave you."</p>
<p>Maybe they were sweet nothings brought on by the hormones of
breastfeeding. Maybe just an exploration of this new step in their
relationship.</p>
<p>But as Faye kissed Jessica goodbye when she departed for the diner, the
blond believed the words she'd said. All her life she'd used every tool
at her disposal to get what she wanted. Her charm, her kindness, her
clever mind, her sex appeal: all weapons in her arsonal.</p>
<p>Armed with a new confidence, unexplained but very real, she went
straight to work figuring up the best way to make the shared dream
between her and her beautiful girl come true. The words she spoke hadn't
only been romantic lover's poetry. They were a creed, one she would sign
her name under; a blood pact.</p>
<p>Or, in her case, a milk pact.</p>
<p>_____</p>
<p>City Bus</p>
<p>Two Weeks Later</p>
<p>"Ahh," the poof of afro rose followed by a satisfied face.</p>
<p>"Finished just in time for our stop," Faye took a hand towel and wiped
off her right breast before holstering it back into her tank top and
covering it with a maroon lightweight athletic jacket.</p>
<p>"Sorry I couldn't get it all done before we got out bed this morning."</p>
<p>Jessica's hand extended for the cotton towel. She was going to use it to
wipe her lips. Instead, Faye leaned down and gave a tongue-led kiss to
clean her lover's sweetened mouth of any milky residue.</p>
<p>"I've gotten huge. Even nursing takes a while now."</p>
<p>"Somebody's proud of her big boobies," Jessica rolled her eyes,
flustered by the public kiss. People were gathering their things and the
bustle helped keep the spit swap private, but the caramel-skinned girl
knew that her partner wouldn't have been wary even if they happened to
have an audience.</p>
<p>"Hey, if you've got it. . ." Faye stood and stretched till her fingers
touched the bus ceiling.</p>
<p>Jessy made sure her hair was in place as her emerald eyes prowled the
titties she'd just finished milking. The blond's whole body was on
display from profile. The most dominating bow from her centerline were
her delicious, jiggly jugs. Even empty of contents, they maintained heft
and mass. Plus, they had to be sticking out a foot in front of Faye's
person. The pair rewarded attentive eyes, as they moved freely without a
bra and bulged attractively from the scooping neck of the tank top.</p>
<p>Her cup size was unknown. That was part of the reason for their trip to
the mall; the more interesting part. They both knew the taller girl had
grown. The fun would be in figuring out how much. Though, even without a
concrete number, Jessica understood her girlfriend to be several
measurements larger. Just to think, on that first night when she'd
rocketed home in a tizzy, she and Faye were comparable in size with the
blond edging out a bit.</p>
<p>Faye's hand extended to her partner. Jessica took it with a dainty wrist
and kept her eyes on how Faye's tits moved. Dry as a bone, the taller
girl was more than double Jessica's own size and now edged out her head
for volume.</p>
<p>They held hands departing the bus and stayed connected entering the Town
Walk. Cars weren't allowed to drive the streets that connected store to
restaurant, restaurant to movie theater, and theater to yet another
store. Saturdays had the streets teeming with walkers taking photos by
the fountain and weaving through kiosks and palm trees. It was an active
day and summer's heat at last started to wane into autumn breeze.</p>
<p>Shopping had always been fun growing up, so Jessica was happy that it
was fun with Faye as well. Before breastfeeding, they never spent much
time out together. Sex was the only item on the menu. Now that adult
nursing had brought them close, they could joke and flirt openly as they
looked through whatever caught their eyes, noncommittal to each new
glimmer.</p>
<p>In a trinket shop called Ad-Tastic, they browsed every item seen in
obtrusive banner ads on webpages. Faye found a ukulele and strummed it a
few times.</p>
<p>"You play?" Jessica pointed.</p>
<p>"I wish. I hear it's easy. I'd like to learn."</p>
<p>Jessica reached for the cheap wooden piece, mounted it in the pit of her
arm and gave a test strum. In under a minute, she had the instrument
tuned and was plucking out a reggae tune. The thrill lighting in Faye's
eyes made her feel ten feet tall.</p>
<p>"You siren! You went all this time without telling me you we're
musically talented?"</p>
<p>Faye didn't give her a chance to reply though. She slithered behind the
shorter girl's back and held her from behind. They started to gyrate
together, dancing in the aisle. Huge, soft tits made the exposed back of
Jessica's neck heat up. Occasionally, porcelain orbs brushed her ears
and she could do nothing but dream of being surrounded in their velvet
softness. It was odd that Faye was tall enough to reach her ears, but
such worries were so superfluous compared to her rising lust.</p>
<p>"Faye. You know how easy I am to get hot. . ." Jessica turned up her
chin and whispered.</p>
<p>But instead of retreating, this reaction only got her squeezed tighter.
"Hey, I'm just dancing to the music. If you want me to stop, then stop
serenading me."</p>
<p>It was the whimsical teasing that always made her feel okay, so the
ukulele player went on. All along, breasts pressed into her shoulders,
entrapping the back of her head. She tried to lean forward to lessen the
contact and fend off a moan, but Faye came behind her even tighter so
she couldn't escape.</p>
<p>"Shit," the younger girl hissed an octave too high.</p>
<p>"Are you thinking about sucking them right now?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>The response earned prowling hands that started to move promiscuously
under her cute cyan date blouse. Footsteps rang clear on the next aisle
over. Jessica went scrambling to the side, reggae going mute, but the
taller girl caught her and didn't let go. Even without the music, her
hands were tempting.</p>
<p>"In our new house one day," Faye leaned down but spoke clearly in her
frantic girlfriend's ear. "I want us to have a music room. I want hours
of lessons from you every day, and I'll pay you in all the milk you can
drink. How does that sound?"</p>
<p>Jessica's eyes darted to both ends of the aisle, praying that she
wouldn't find a child, or a nun, or her parents watching as she a woman
began to undress her. Fear didn't kill lust. What it did do was dampen
the roaring fire just barely so that she could say what needed saying to
keep from fucking in a public shop.</p>
<p>"Great. Mhmm, sounds good," she rushed out.</p>
<p>"That wasn't convincing."</p>
<p>"I want a music room in our future house. I want to teach you how to
play all sorts of instruments, to share my love of music with my love of
you." Jessica's hand gently lighted on the fairer one which was climbing
up her abs toward a bra.</p>
<p>"What else? Don't miss the best part."</p>
<p>For a brief time, it felt like she was acting without agency, like her
lust was being played against her. The Faye she knew was capable of such
a thing and it needed to be pointed out --- when it was inappropriate,
especially. But in the moment? Jessica summed her feelings and decided
to play along. How far could she really get by taking a logical argument
where she was? Not half an hour earlier, she was drinking milk from the
source in the backseat of a city bus. What ethical grounds did she
really have?</p>
<p>"I want to be rewarded with your sweet, thick milk. I want it all for
me, to have it replace my meals some days. It's all I think about ---
they're growing against my head right now and all I can think of is how
badly I need it."</p>
<p>The shuffle of feet made the white space around Jessica's emerald eyes
show. "Need what? A house with a music room? I can help with that."</p>
<p>The drama of being exposed in front of a complete stranger would have
made a weaker women faint. Fortunately, Jessica had built up a tolerance
for stress so she remained conscious even if all her composure left her.
She couldn't believe she missed him, had let herself be so distracted.
All her upbringing, she feared her overactive sex drive would be found
out and that she'd be labelled a slut for it. It didn't help that she
was had C cups by age ten and double D's in adulthood despite being
vigilant about her diet.</p>
<p>Now a piece of that fear returned. She shrank to match her middle school
disposition, curling behind the more 'grown up' Faye to handle the
public interaction. While doing so, she was certain that Faye was taller
or broader or both. Her hips and ass were showstoppers in her jeans, and
neither of them had ever been so close to the younger girl's eyeline.</p>
<p>The guy's name was Marcus. He worked as a realtor and wanted to make a
deal on a new housing development popping up in the next town over.
Jessica noticed Faye's couth in public situations, beaming confidence
and weaselling her will into the conversation. By the time it was over,
the tall, busty blond was the person of value, dangling her 'yes' over
the guy's head.</p>
<p>"I'll have to check with my boss but we can definitely talk more,"
Marcus said as he dismissed himself. He tipped his head toward Jessica
then at Faye and extended his card.</p>
<p>The blond took it, slipping the cardstock overtly between her milky
white udders. Before his boner could embarrass him any further, he
walked off.</p>
<p>Was that what I'm like, Jessica wondered. She felt that way all the
time; Faye pulled the strings and got what she wanted. In the end,
Jessica obeyed and was horny as hell. Marcus's submission and begging
was so weak-looking. If there was anything she didn't like, it was the
idea of her looking in any way weak.</p>
<p>"Babe, you alright?" Faye asked.</p>
<p>They'd been walking down the strip silently having purchased nothing
from Ad-Tastic.</p>
<p>"Fine."</p>
<p>"That's how I know you aren't. Care to talk about it?"</p>
<p>"Nah, I'm too much in my own head. Don't worry about it."</p>
<p>"Wanna have a little drink to calm down?"</p>
<p>"Do I. . . wait, what?"</p>
<p>The buxom blond stopped her partner in front of a bistro restaurant. She
gestured to her breasts and opened her jacket at the lapel. Since they
were presented exactly at her eye level, emerald eyes never left the
creamy white landscape before her. "It's been about an hour so they've
grown some. You could drink what's there. It's probably quite a bit."
Shoulders started to shimmy, causing the colossal milkers to sway
abundantly. "I want you to drink when you want. Don't feel like you
can't ask just because I'm on this 'every four hour' thing."</p>
<p>Jessica's body jerked against her will. She knew she wanted a drink. The
groping and dancing from earlier made it clear to her how badly she
longed for a drink and a quickie. Plus, she was so used to just taking
Faye when she wanted. They touched each other liberally now that they'd
bonded and always wore next to nothing in the apartment for easy access.
All that worked against them now.</p>
<p>Not 'them', Jessy noted. Just her. Faye had a resilient confidence to
command social situations. It suddenly felt very unfair, like she'd been
manipulated by going out as a couple even though she'd agreed to it
initially.</p>
<p>She thought on her toes, needing to buy time. "If I drink whenever I
want, when will you produce enough to meet your quota? Aren't you
sending your shipments in to fill your order?"</p>
<p>Faye's demeanor took on a grayer shade. "Of course I am. Why? Are you
under the impression that I haven't been?"</p>
<p>"We just haven't talked about it in a while. Why? Are you offended that
I care about your business?"</p>
<p>Jessica watched her blond bombshell girlfriend change colors several
times before arriving at her same, candid swagger. A few people had
lingered when they saw the two talking on the street, watching one curvy
lady of color interact with an ivory hourglass babe showing the world
her straining top.</p>
<p>"Sorry, I was a little defensive there. It's so sweet that you care
about my business," Faye took a hug, full frontal, even though her
emerald eyed girlfriend would have preferred to keep some space. "I only
got a little upset because it sounded like you thought I couldn't make
enough milk to fill my order and to satisfy you. You do know how massive
I am, right?"</p>
<p>Everyone on Town Walk knew. Men and women alike looked on. Jessy felt
hot under the collar; both pissed at herself for feeling her solid
defense crumbling to nothing and, foolishly, jealous of other eyes
fawning over her busty girlfriend.</p>
<p>"Don't you?" Blue eyes looked down, clear as the sky, as a hand cupped
Jessica's angel hair and pulled her deeper.</p>
<p>There was nothing to do but smell Faye's vanilla scented skin, to feel
the bulging skin rise and fall with her breaths, and to imagine them
rising and falling because of milk; milk that wouldn't stop making her
bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>"I do. . ." the smaller girl feared the consequence for letting it slide
again, but she did so anyway. The time just wasn't right.</p>
<p>"How big?"</p>
<p>"The biggest tits on this whole street. Biggest in the town. If they
aren't biggest in the world, then they're definitely the milkiest,"
Jessica admitted. "And I can't stop thinking about a drink. But this
time, I'll pass. Shouldn't we be finding you a wardrobe?"</p>
<p>A gripping pause followed. Would Faye release her or would she press the
issue? If she were alone in some alley with a woman as sexually engaging
as Faye, Jessy knew she'd do anything to get herself off. The only thing
keeping her from doing so in that very moment were the eyes of
strangers. She didn't want to look loose but she knew in her heart the
way her sexual appetite was hollowing her out.</p>
<p>At last, she was released. A gasp inflated her lungs --- at some point
she'd started holding her breath.</p>
<p>To her relief, the older of the two dismissed the topic of milking for a
later time and they both made their way down Town Walk. Store by store,
the fun of shopping resumed. Though the looming situation of their date
came to the forefront barely an hour later.</p>
<p>Jessica watched her woman model a outfit after revealing outfit. Each
time, more chest was on display. Plus, Faye had a knack for playing
innocent so when her bikini failed and let her chubby nipples out to
play, she didn't bother to take notice despite Jessica's visceral
reaction.</p>
<p>It was in one of several lingerie shops that the younger girl lost
herself. The blond delayed bra shopping to the very end so she could buy
for her full size. Wouldn't you know the beach store designed for petite
girls with barely-there tits didn't carry in a natural M cup.</p>
<p>"I didn't know they came that big. I'm sorry --- man, I must look so
clueless," Faye shook her head, a hand daintily atop her gargantuan
boobage.</p>
<p>The attendant met Jessica's eyes when they both heard the distinct sound
of fabric tearing. They couldn't yet see but both knew if the titan of a
woman was any bigger, she'd lose all semblance of decency.</p>
<p>Faye seemed to know this and forwarded the decision to Jessica's
discretion. They both witnessed the swelling and growing over three
hours. Bigger she grew, showing more flesh and deeper cleavage. From
outfit to outfit, each one looked smaller on her than the last. Each
time, the gorgeous blue-eyed blond made a bigger fuss of how nothing fit
her globes. Steadily, they pressed farther forward, surpassing the size
of both their heads and beyond. Milk weight made them sag to her belly
button, without which they would no doubt suspend effortlessly in the
air like her nipples were hung with invisible wire like some magic
trick.</p>
<p>Between shops they held hands through the increasingly dense crowd. When
they needed squeezing through a tight bunch of people, Faye pulled
Jessica into her favorite snack and dearly beloved items of lust. Less
the marshmallow feel and more resistance each and every time. It was one
thing to watch her grow while at home. In public, with clothes ---
barely --- on, there wasn't a break from it. Jessica was constantly
being reminded. There was only one thing that could be done; but a
single solution within the curly haired girl's power.</p>
<p>"You aren't clueless, baby. We knew they wouldn't have your size to
begin with, right?" Jessica worked her only option in as convincing a
way as possible. "But now we <em>know</em> your size thanks to all the help.
Thank you, Donna. I'll definitely buy a bra from you next time I'm
shopping for one. C'mon, babe."</p>
<p>Then the smaller girl led her living milk station away to the nearest
family bathroom. With little ceremony, she unshouldered Faye's useless
sport jacket and uncupped the tank top-turned-tube top.</p>
<p>Faye said something that Jessica couldn't bother processing. The minute
it was free, she stuffed her face with nipple and areola and boob flesh
and greedily drank. Her body's reaction was like she'd gone days without
water only to be blessed with rain. Thick brew spewed hot and heavy at
her throat in overwhelming quantity. She almost cried --- it was that
good. She'd missed it <em>that</em> much.</p>
<p>"You'll have a tummy ache if you drink too fast." Faye's back was to the
wall. She didn't seem to care so much about warning her partner.</p>
<p>Jessica let her blouse be unbuttoned. She let long fingers on pleasant
hands squeeze her exposed tits through her bra. All she cared about was
drinking, so she did so. The sounds her throat made were loud and told
the story of how much milk was actually being drained. No longer were
ounces or even cups a good measure. One breast seemed to harbor an
impossible liter of milk --- more for every minute over the appointed
four hour milking time. And some sick, enamored part of the emerald-eyed
beauty took great satisfaction in being the jealous benefactor of all of
it.</p>
<p>The crowds could look and lust, but Jessica got to stuff her face and
gorge herself.</p>
<p>Watching boobs return to marshmallow pillow globes was always an
interesting experience. Jessica beheld her lover returning to an
accepting softness as she drank. Her swallows smoothed to a rhythm,
losing the voracity of waiting four hours without her precious milk.
Before one could get too small and lopsided, she switched to the other,
working her jaw wider to accept and clenching when she wanted to squeeze
out a river.</p>
<p>"You're so good to me, Jessy. Your tongue and lips feel so good on my
nipples," Faye reminded while keeping sweetness; this wasn't their first
time, yet it felt so new.</p>
<p>Jessica's eyes fluttered closed. A grin came to her face. Sure, she'd
been manipulated again but milk was her reward for it --- all that she
could drink. Then her already busty girlfriend would have another two
liters to chug. And another two after that. Such a size seemed too much
for her at the start. Her body adjusted, though, and could handle such
quantities with little effort now. In fact, it tingled with warmth and
feel-good hormones abounded.</p>
<p>Almost forty-five minutes later, the couple emerged to a disgruntled
woman with an occupied stroller.</p>
<p>"You two do know I've been waiting almost an hour right? That bathroom's
got the only decent cleaning station in all of Town Walk and-. . ."</p>
<p>"Sorry, ma'am," Faye held up a hand. "My girlfriend was feeling really
sick and the women's bathroom was occupied at the time."</p>
<p>The woman's face went from disdain to admiration in an instant. There
was familiarity as her eyes bounced from Jessica's eyes to her stomach.
The caramel-toned girl thought she might have done something wrong.
Like, maybe the woman was applauding two hot girls getting all sexy in
the bathroom together which would, in turn, make her the woman she
feared being.</p>
<p>Instead, the lady walked beside her stroller. She ignored the premise of
personal space and went straight for Jessica's belly. "You're showing so
much! Gah, I'd do anything to be pregnant again --- not anything, but
you get my point. I loved how alive I felt and how closely connected I
was with my partner." Looking from Faye to Jessica and without removing
her hand from the orb of a belly, she blinked a few times. "Girlfriends?
Oh, yes. You two are together! Wow, I'm so sorry. Congratulations! How
far along are you?"</p>
<p>Just coming down from her sexual peak, the younger girl's mind felt
sluggish.</p>
<p>The blond answered in her place. "If you could believe it, just a little
over a month!"</p>
<p>The woman gasped. "No!"</p>
<p>"Yes!"</p>
<p>"What?!"</p>
<p>"I know!"</p>
<p>Then they squealed together. It hurt Jessica's ears. She was recently
fingered and fed; it was time for a nap. She could barely force herself
to smile.</p>
<p>"You're super pregnant, hon!"</p>
<p>Faye held her lovingly. "She was very trim before; so fit with a tiny
waist. She wanted to be healthy for the baby. We were kinda worried when
she started showing so much, but the doctor says everything looks good."</p>
<p>The stranger gave Jessica's shoulder a squeeze. "The sickness will pass,
hon. After that, it'll be smooth sailing --- best time of my life,
that's for sure. And you two are the cutest together, gah! So happy for
you!"</p>
<p>Jessica managed a "thanks," then she tucked herself under Faye.</p>
<p>The older one got the signal. "Looks like momma's gotten all the walking
she needs today. We're gonna head back home now! Oh, but if you don't
mind --- and I know, this is forward as heck, but --- if we could maybe
exchange socials? As much as we research, it's always comforting to have
a friend that's farther along in the baby raising process."</p>
<p>The lady looked like she'd been elected Miss America. As she and Faye
exchanged info, all Jessica could pay attention to was how both women
were probably lactating. The size difference of two women apparently
doing the same thing was mindblowing. Grace --- that was her name, by
the way --- wasn't petite but was slim and had amazing mom boobs. Big,
springy, perky, and clearly full. There was every reason to suspect that
she needed the time alone to breastfeed her son, with her bra busting F
or G cups.</p>
<p>But Faye was on another level. Faye was like varsity captain of the
lactation team and Grace wasn't even up to competitive form yet.
Clearly, the relationship based on a lie was for future leverage,
Jessica thought, but Faye made lying look a little too easy.</p>
<p>Even with her dopamine at record high levels, the emerald-eyed girl
couldn't help but feel like she was a baby toward Faye. In a way, it was
good --- being coddled, given attention and adored. Being strolled
around at another woman's discretion, manipulated, and becoming an
accomplice to lies? Less so.</p>
<p>_____</p>
<p>Moving Day</p>
<p>Two Months Later</p>
<p>Faye wished her lover away to work her final shift at her job. In a few
hours, Faye would drive their car to the diner to pick her up and they'd
both head off to the home they'd just purchased. The look on her
green-eyed girlfriend's face was utter romance when she left. For nearly
three months Jessy had been nursing from Faye's breasts and it showed in
how she looked at the blond.</p>
<p>"Like I'm her everything," Faye spoke when she was alone.</p>
<p>And maybe something else too. Jessica would go silent at times, as if
mulling over something heavy, then snap to attention when her name was
called. She was having trouble adapting to their life which was changing
at a dizzying rate. Understandable. And, more importantly, it was
greater evidence that Faye was right all along.</p>
<p>Thinking of Jessica always made her happy. Faye used the buzz of
happiness to tide her over. She wanted only good vibes today as it
marked an important step for the couple: their first day in their new
home, their first night of going full time into Faye's natural breast
milk manufacturing business, and their first day engaged to be married.</p>
<p>Fetching the remaining champagne from the kitchen and reclining on the
sofa, the blond massaged her full, weighty chest and remembered the
moment. An abundance of curly black hair framed her gorgeous face,
frozen for countable seconds in awe. The ring was almost too small for
her finger. Then it cleared her second knuckle and landed snuggly into
place and they kissed and held each other for a second eternity. Romance
filled the night with a full course meal catered in, balloons, sexy
music, candles, lingerie, alcoholics a'plenty, and milk, milk, and more
milk.</p>
<p>"Mmm, what a night." Just thinking about it made her grow. Yes, she knew
good times made the milk flow faster. In the two months, her body had
transformed yet again.</p>
<p>Her knee hooked over the couch since at full height, she stood at
six-foot-four. Only a fraction of her hips could fit on the piece of
furniture, and her hair was so lush and long it ran like a liquid down
to the floor. The changes were so incremental and the older woman was so
busy with her 'business' that she didn't really notice till her new
garments stopped fitting. A lingering look in the mirror a mere week
prior forced her to pay closer attention to her new physical adornments.</p>
<p>She thought she should be bothered by them, but she wasn't. She
suspected Jessica might be curious but her lover's cares were so often
trivial. Her new body only reflected an inner confidence. All her life
she knew herself to be a head above everyone with a body that wouldn't
quit and milk that could provide cars and homes and financial
independence. Now, she looked the part. It was just a manifestation of
her new reality. Nothing to be too bothered over. Certainly nothing to
negatively affect her business or engagement.</p>
<p>Thinking about Jessica got her hot. Faye made the couch scrunch and
squeak as she hefted her burdens and dropped them, playing with her
generous amounts of feminine mass. All the milk had added softness to
Jessica's edges. Her hips were wider, middle less defined, and her butt
was quickly becoming a favorite of Faye's. And the extra calories
weren't just distributed from the abs down. The green-eyed girl
bolstered a pair of huge, squishy bozongas.</p>
<p>"Fuck yes, that's my sexy wife," Faye threw back her head, brushing her
hands over her exposed tits. They were M cups naturally now without the
aid of milk. Though, at her current constant production, it was rare
that she ever be truly empty. "Made so thick and curvy by all my milk."</p>
<p>She pictured Jessy filling out her collared top and diner apron earlier
and felt her tits lurching in size quickly as a result. Just about any
thought of Jess made her milky. Her boobies had learned who was most
receptive to them.</p>
<p>Disregarding time, decency, or modesty, the six-foot-four hourglass
bombshell imagined her sugar-addict of a lover and enjoyed herself
expanding.</p>
<p>Her M cups grew bigger, inflating with a wash of fluid that was near
audible. In moments, they were making progress. Her nipples were gaining
in length, poking through the rounded bulb of areola. She watched her
pink nubs turn to blazing spears with further progressing volume chased
them outward and away from Faye's body.</p>
<p>She adjusted to standard sitting position with a leg up on the coffee
table. Her sweeping turned to fisting and she lost her arms in her
abundance. Her skin hadn't lost its sensitive feel. She moaned when she
touched herself --- areas that multiplied the larger she grew, the more
milk she produced.</p>
<p>"I need to fill you up, Jessy. Don't stop. Drink me all down. I need to
see you when you've swallowed all of me," Faye groaned with power and
desire.</p>
<p>Her body reacted. Her breasts pressed further forward. They began to
sink with milk weight, pulling their owner into her own lap, straining
her shoulders. The delight was more than the discomfort and she
continued.</p>
<p>She squeezed and squished herself. With each go, she pushed out the
elasticity. Her boobs grew thicker and denser like dough but were all
the more fun to play with. Especially when she felt herself reaching
four cup sizes larger, then six, then eight. With her size, she could
only really grasp growth in leaps and bounds or in physical markers.</p>
<p>Her tits spilled over in her lap at a certain size. Before long she had
to stand or go recline on her bed before they took her to the floor.
Getting to her feet, a surge of growth struck her swift and hard. Even
with her practiced grace and size, the flurry of milk surging threw her
off of her forward balance. Her fat, round bottom poked out to try to
counter the sudden shift but it was too late.</p>
<p>She struck the floor with a slam. Before it, though, she struck the
coffee table. Her body was so large and breasts so heavy that the wooden
stage was cracked and bent in the middle.</p>
<p>It filled the blond with exhilleration.</p>
<p>"Well, we're moving today. No need to bring old relics like you," she
cursed the table. She gave her tits a pat and she swore she heard a
deep, ominous gurgle of liquid being churned.</p>
<p>With the strength of her new body, she was able to find footing and rise
from the ground. The size of her titanic tits were too grand to see the
damage, but if she shifted them to the left she could look to her right
and see the flattened center with perfect curves on the two ends. It
must have been made cheaply, she thought, since it moulded around her
boobs instead of snapping like real wood.</p>
<p>"The new house has real wooden tables and chairs and floors. No room for
fake stuff," she wiggled her nose, and her ass, and her tits.</p>
<p>She felt her perfect skin brushing against her thighs while standing
tall and revelled at the view of her giants extending more than two feet
in front of her. Rapture took her when she took the time to give her
body the attention it deserved. Magnetic hands clung to whatever section
of her plump, taut flesh they could reach knowing fully that she would
have to do some gymnastics to milk herself at this size.</p>
<p>This was what happened when she let herself go --- unhinged growth. In
these few months the blue-eyed woman had learned her triggers and
figured out her mental blocks. Within reason, she could milk on command.
Secretly, in the meditative depths of herself, she willed her production
to slow.</p>
<p>"Our precious girl isn't here. No need to continue."</p>
<p>It was a chant, a mantra, a prayer --- the prayer to the goddess she
considered herself. And it was answered when she felt the the tremors
slow and her blood pressure dropping. Her breathing no longer needed
regulation and her skin stopped vibrating with such sharpened desire to
breastfeed. Her nipples were the length of her hand and would never stop
being hard, but they lost girth and general suckability. Her bulging,
shiny areola lightened a shade as well.</p>
<p>The tide stopped rising.</p>
<p>"This should be enough for a few weeks."</p>
<p>At that, she gave herself about a dozen more loving squeezes and trotted
to the bedroom. It would take the remainder of Jessica's shift to milk
herself back to a size capable of fitting into a car.</p>
<p>_____</p>
<p>Sally's Diner</p>
<p>Jessica</p>
<p>The last shift is always the shortest.</p>
<p>Jessica mopped her hands clean with a rag she kept in her apron and
checked the time. The smell of grease, the broken cookware, and the
shady but lovable staff. Even if waitressing was the worst job she'd
ever had, there were parts of it to miss.</p>
<p>One such part was sitting at an empty booth by the door, flagging her
over. Jessica fixed up her stylish blazer and loose cotton top, sure
that her new push up bra accomplished its namesake without looking too
whorish. The thing was already tight on her and she'd bought it at a
premium in an F cup --- an F cup push up bra was already pretty slutty,
when she thought about it. But it was the only thing that made her feel
secure and supported; the lesser of two evils. Either she shows a bit
more cleavage, which could be buttoned up --- the current blazer didn't
button as it had grown too small anyway --- or she bounces endlessly
drawing even greater attention to her generous bosom.</p>
<p>"Don't worry about it, you look great," Sally said as the emerald-eyed
girl neared. "And it's your last day. I can hardly get onto you for
anything."</p>
<p>Jessica figured the same. Most of her worries were from the past when
the weight first started coming on. Not only was it too late to worry
about her push up bra, it was a non-issue for the new future that was
unfolding at that very moment..</p>
<p>"I didn't clock out."</p>
<p>"Let it run. Consider it severance pay." Sally paused for Jessica to
take a seat, then continued. "Wow, I can't believe it. You're finally
done after all this time." Ms.Hightower shook her head, sipping on a cup
of joe she'd just prepared.</p>
<p>"Me neither. It's been a whirlwind of a month; two actually."</p>
<p>Sally was a middle-aged woman, nothing remarkable about her features or
form. All her praise was closely linked to the diner she'd opened
herself when she was seventeen. It was a classic looking sort of place,
record players used as decorations and the fender from an old car
Jessica never recognized was mounted to the bar. Dalmation tile floors
made the numerous misprinted road signs on the walls pop in their
metallic reds and yellows.</p>
<p>"And you're positive? You don't want me to keep a place for you here
just in case?"</p>
<p>"I do wonder at times."</p>
<p>"Say the word, sweety. You're my right hand around here; I don't shy
away from admitting that. I'd turn this world upside down to keep you
here."</p>
<p>The girl with a whole new life ahead of her lost some of her perfect
posture and leaned into the table. The weight of her chest --- the
weight of <em>something</em> --- came to the forefront. "Can I ask you
something?"</p>
<p>"Sure."</p>
<p>"It's a touchy thing but here goes: I'm not sure I want to leave. I told
you about the house and the new job and about Faye. Something just
doesn't feel right about it."</p>
<p>"You just nervous? This is a big step."</p>
<p>Jessica's heart sped up so she rest a hand at the center of her chest to
calm it. Most of what she felt were her huge breasts, which annoyed and
reminded her of the pleasures of a fuller body. "I'm nervous too. But
it's something else. Makes me angry --- angrier than I've been in a
while. I don't know why I'm pissed to be handed such great things."</p>
<p>"Are you jealous?"</p>
<p>"That Faye's steadily improving her life? Getting richer and hotter and
better networked? Heck yea, I'm jealous."</p>
<p>"What do you mean 'her' life? You girls are sharing this life, aren't
you?"</p>
<p>The tan girls paused everything --- breathing included. Had she meant to
segment herself away from Faye then? "Right. It's our life," she
corrected. "I guess it isn't jealousy?"</p>
<p>Sally had a frown that could wrinkle a dead man. She'd run off customers
with it when they got too touchy over the female employees and cracked
lazy ass workers into shape. It both frightened and inspired Jessica; if
only her emerald eyes could hold such danger and experience.</p>
<p>"You and me are alike. We're prideful women --- bet you thought I was
going to say beautiful," Sally winked.</p>
<p>Jessy cracked a grin. Ms. Hightower was self-aware enough to know her
best days were radiant but also that they were behind her.</p>
<p>"But yes, pride. Listen here, I opened this diner myself and it's my
baby. There's a fulfillment that comes with working for everything you
have. When me and my ex-husband were together, he was the type that
bought everything for me. And guess what? I was miserable. For a few
months it was great. Then, I got bored --- and rebellious afterward."</p>
<p>"That's. . . exactly where I am, I think."</p>
<p>"Of course it is! I know this sort of stuff." Sally slurped her coffee,
managing snark within the most mundane of tasks. "And my guess is, you
haven't talked about these feelings with the one person who needs to
hear about them."</p>
<p>Jessica remembered all the times she almost spoke up and chose sex or
milk instead. "Educated guess? Cause you're spot on."</p>
<p>Sally shrugged. "The sex must be great."</p>
<p>If Jessy's cheeks could show her blushing. . . "Did you just say?
Wh-what is going on? How did-. . . Ms.Hightower."</p>
<p>"How many mornings have you come in here with eyes twinkling, wagglin'
your hips like a newborn puppy? Nobody likes diner work that much ---
especially not me. Only a few things I know that make a woman do that."</p>
<p>"A woman. . ."</p>
<p>"That's what you are," Sally spoke lightly. She forgave her favorite
employee for taking so long to understand. "And it's what you better
start acting like. Live your damned truth. Say you don't want handouts
if you don't want 'em."</p>
<p>Jessica balled up her fists. "I will. Next time I see her."</p>
<p>Sally reached across the table and linked hands with Jessica
supportively. "And never forget I'm <em>so</em> proud of you. For this and
everything --- really, Jessy, I am. Happy for you and your fianceé."</p>
<p>Jessica chuckled, pride showing through a goofy grin. "Thank you so much
for understanding. Though, I'm not sure what I want is to stay here if
that's the case. I do love to cook but like you said, diner work takes
it out of me."</p>
<p>"Then beat it," Sally stuck out her tongue. "And we'll make do here
without you. We always do."</p>
<p>The bell above the door tingled. "Welcome to Sally's," Sally called.</p>
<p>Faye shouted back. "I-I was looking for Jessica?"</p>
<p>"I'm here," Jessica turned, one hand still squeezing Sally's.</p>
<p>In came Faye, behaving demure and light. Her blonde ribbons of hair,
once average length, now brushed the back of her calves. As she came
around, the room's energy felt like it bent over backwards to
accommodate her. Like a proper piece of art or a skilled photograph, all
lines in the tile led to Faye, as did the lines of the eyes in the room.
A waitress wiping off the bar froze solid like Faye was an icy queen. A
chef on his grill did a triple take, reacting opposite to his co-worker
as he broke into a sweat.</p>
<p>"Hello, wifey," Faye sauntered over and planted a kiss on Jessica's
cheek in no uncertain terms. The kiss was like a brand, marking
territory before a wedding could ever hope to. "Hello, Ms. Sally. Sorry
if I'm interrupting."</p>
<p>"H-hey," Sally began, struggling to stay cordial, fumbling with her
words. She seemed to realize she was still holding Jessica's hand and
reeled her appendage back, wishing not to offend. "Faye, right? We, umm,
we met before. . ."</p>
<p>"I was Jessica's character reference when she did her interview. We met
over coffee," Faye reminded her.</p>
<p>For a woman who had spent more than half her life in customer service,
Sally was doing a terrible job of veiling her bodily stresses. Faye
seemed to eat it all up, though, indulging how her body changed a room
and the people inside. The youngest of the three watched with unease.
Even Sally wasn't prepared for Faye's beauty. She probably remembered
the Faye she had coffee with and wasn't expecting a tower with the
curves of ten combined women.</p>
<p>"Right," Sally said, then cleared her throat.</p>
<p>Then came a silence, stillness brought about by the shifting gravity. A
smile slithered onto Faye's face because she knew it was her body
causing the social disturbance. Soaking it in, delaying respite of her
charms as long as possible, Faye said, "I didn't want to rush or
anything, babe. Just letting you know I'm here and that I got a call
from the HOA for us to pick up our keys."</p>
<p>Nobody said a word. They all just stared for a few more seconds, Jessica
included, as if trying to make sense of the ascended female before them.
Faye rolled her eyes. "Yes, I'm stacked. Yes, they're real. Maybe, if
you're nice, I'll let you <em>touch</em> them," she winked in Sally's
direction.</p>
<p>The needle found the record again.</p>
<p>"Oh! O-oh my god, was I starring?! I'm SO sorry, I-I just. . ."</p>
<p>Faye waved off Sally's apology. Jessica wondered how she was supposed to
best this beast of a woman if Sally herself was losing brain cells
trying to calculate how so much sex appeal could be crammed into one
human being.</p>
<p>Faye's turtleneck sweater struggled --- not that there was a garment in
the world that could do anything more than struggle --- to stand against
her forces. Even breathing looked like a battle being waged, one that
her outfit was losing on every major front. If anything, it looked as if
her moonish boobs were devouring her clothing, scarlet red stretching
absurdly. There wasn't a loose wrinkle in sight on the
double-extra-large top, but lines of fabric creaked like rubber bands at
the weaker areas. The middle seam, which was supposed to be hidden by
her arm, was a jagged zag of indecision demonstrating the tug-of-war
going on between her shelf of mighty, feminine meat ignoring gravity and
the handiwork of the tailor who crafted the autumn garb.</p>
<p>Jessica couldn't help but feel a certain pity for everyone affected. She
wished Faye hadn't just waltzed in unannounced and simultaneously knew
her future wife wasn't capable of doing anything but making a scene of
herself. She also wished her co-workers --- and boss for fuck's sake ---
weren't drooling over her betrothed. The feelings were so complex. It
was the type of situation that had torn the younger girl's inhibitions
away and made her submit to a drink and a fuck, responsibility be
damned.</p>
<p>And Faye was looking extra delicious in the tight little sweater of
hers. It was Jessica's first time seeing the thing. It highlighted her
bulging set of areola and wide nipples perfectly. And, of course, her
pale blimps were fucking huge! They'd grown over the car ride for
certain. There was plenty of milk to be had.</p>
<p>To have such a fountain available whenever she wanted --- for life to
have such an easy button. . .</p>
<p>Jessica shook herself to clarity when she felt the hunger bray
powerfully through her.</p>
<p>"It's not every day people see a chest like mine," Faye relished even
mentioning that the extra weight she carried around was hers. A proud
hand lighted the top of her right breast, then roamed to her outer edges
overtly. "It doesn't help that I'm not wearing a bra, either."</p>
<p>"No, no it's, uh, my bad," Sally tried looking at the table, then the
window, then her employees but found no safe place for her gaze to rest.
"I was just letting Jessica know I'd miss her and to call me if she ever
needed anything."</p>
<p>"You're sweet," Faye stepped up, placing a hand on Sally's shoulder,
tilting herself down so her titties rang like church bells. "Thanks for
being so good to her. She's the most important woman in the world to me,
so if you ever need <em>anything</em> from me," Faye's breast slumped heavy
against Sally's shoulder. "Consider me in your debt."</p>
<p>Jessica jumped from her seat, and grabbed Faye by the upper arm. Her
expression was bristling like grease on a hot frying pan. "I'll be sure
to come back and visit. I'll miss you, Sally."</p>
<p>Sally bore a similar sentiment. She and Jessica exchanged a hug that was
evidence of their positive work relationship. When Sally beheld Faye,
though, her neck and face blushed rapidly. She considered something in
her mind, unintentionally glancing at Faye's tits despite every effort
to avoid doing just that, and extended her hand as a peace offering.</p>
<p>Faye took the handshake mercifully.</p>
<p>_____</p>
<p>Highway 3269</p>
<p>Faye</p>
<p>After brief goodbyes to the opening shift workers, the newly engaged
couple ventured up the highway.</p>
<p>Jessica seemed to be mulling over something in her head, which Faye paid
minimal attention to till the silence was broke with, "You were, uh,
really popular with Sally."</p>
<p>"You noticed? Ugh, she was <em>really</em> eyeing me up," Faye feigned
repugnance. In actuality, she was considering a threesome, one an
ordinary woman like Sally would appreciate for the rest of her life.
"Like, doesn't she have a boyfriend or girlfriend or something?"</p>
<p>"Divorced. Her husband was in the military and met a girl while
deployed. He was already having a kid with the mistress when he told
Sally the truth."</p>
<p>Faye downloaded the sob story, thinking of a way to make use of it.
"Poor thing. I kinda feel bad now, for thinking of her as some pervert."
Except Sally did give those vibes. She, like many women, probably had
repressed longing and sexual need. It would take a little time but if
she could scratch Sally's itch, she might return the favor by buying a
few gallons of milk to be used in new dishes. Other food service places
were already using Faye's yummy, all natural product to great success.
Sally's would be a more personal, intimate partnership.</p>
<p>Jessica rolled her eyes, a dangerous act going seventy on a highway.
"Nah, she's pretty vanilla. Just sort of lonely."</p>
<p>Faye planted a seed. "Once we get settled in, we should have her over
for dinner. Since she clearly sees you as part of her extended family;
she's always been so good to you."</p>
<p>"Aww, babe," Jessica squeezed her fianceé's thigh. "That would be so
fun. You're so smart to think like that." They shared a cheesy, cutesy
couple moment before Jessica swapped topics to what she must have been
concerned about from the beginning. "But I get why she was at a loss for
words. You've been producing much faster lately."</p>
<p>Faye couldn't just come out and say it, but when Jessica acknowledged
her milk factories she felt jubilant to discuss them. "Scared I'll
outgrow the passenger seat?"</p>
<p>"A little. I look at the road for a few seconds and look back and you're
already bigger. You must be, I don't know, perpetually growing?"</p>
<p>"So?"</p>
<p>Jessica's hand on Faye's thigh formed new intentions. It didn't have to
travel far to Faye's chest as it slept like a monster in her lap. A tan
hand found purchase on the space just below Faye's nipple and
immediately started groping.</p>
<p>"You're obsessed," Faye teased, clearing hair away from her face. "It's
cute. You used to be afraid to drink it. Now, it's all you seem to think
about."</p>
<p>Jessica jerked the wheel. She had to correct because her beautiful boob
gazing had her drifting into the slow lane. Fortunately, nobody was
around to endanger and Jessica was allowed to resume breast-focused
activities. "You're addictive, babe," she said bluntly. "It's creepy ---
all this stuff happening that <em>isn't</em> just lactation. Your skin is even
clearer, your hair grew <em>feet</em> in <em>weeks</em>. I know I've been freaking all
the way out about it, and I know you're going to tell me to ignore it
but. . ."</p>
<p>"But?"</p>
<p>"It's like you're transforming. . . into something not quite like
yourself. And that's not all. I've got issues with other stuff too."</p>
<p>"Issues, huh?"</p>
<p>"We're engaged so I think it's fair to be really honest. I-I've been
thinking about how you're becoming more beautiful every day and
succeeding and living your dream. It's great and all --- hell, you made
a down payment on a house in three months! But I've been feeling kinda,
I don't know, upset --- not just the house, but everything."</p>
<p>Faye interrupted with action. Her sweater made popping noises as seams
snapped all around her. She was bunching it up, trying to maneuver the
red outfit over her immense melons. "You're jealous and I adore it."</p>
<p>"Maybe I am." The driver paused to swallow a lump in her throat as her
sixth sense alerted her to the presence of very milkable titties. "But
it's more than that. I have my own dreams and I don't feel like I've
done anything to make them come true. I get worried that all I've done
is taken a hand out."</p>
<p>"We never would have gotten this far without your effort, Jess. Not the
first deal, nor the next deal, or the one after that. And here we are,
official suppliers, with hundreds of thousands in contracts that we can
fulfill because of <em>your</em> help," Faye got the sweater up to the equator
of her titties. At that point, her lengthy nipples caught attractively
but Jessica could still feel the naked flesh of her lover's swollen
mountains. "You working is anything but a handout. It's love. I like it.
It's <em>sexy</em>. If there's anybody I want to love me, own me, and work with
me, it's you."</p>
<p>"Faye. You aren't getting it."</p>
<p>"I think I do and it's nothing to worry about." Faye unsheathed only her
left nipple, the one closest to its admirer. It almost glowed with
warmth, alive, permanently awake like a tower atop her hilly, pink
areola. "We did this together and we prosper together. Our dreams are
both coming true, so relax."</p>
<p>When the curly haired girl soothed into her seat, it gave Faye a
tremendous high. She was seraphic, magical, and otherworldly. She had
high expectations of herself, all of which were given physicality in her
huge tits, wide hips, sexy ass, and lasting confidence. She suspected
herself to be <em>better</em> than others so, when confronted with these
superhuman experiences --- magic milk production, clearer skin,
lengthening hair, and more than a foot of height in three months --- it
only populated her open case with evidence. The universe itself, it
seemed, was baptising her into a newness of being. Nature had selected
her for better --- for superiority.</p>
<p>Wanting her lover to affirm her, the blond took a hand from the steering
wheel and directed it to her semi-erect nipple. The grip quaked, nerves
getting to her. "God it's so huge," Jessica whispered with a begging
intonation.</p>
<p>"I wonder if milk will ruin the interior," Faye mentioned on a whim.</p>
<p>Clearly, Faye underestimated her new influential powers had, or maybe
the emotional intensity of her partner. Before she knew it, they were
whipping down the off ramp at an exit and screaming into the parking lot
of a brown building. Upon closer inspection, the place of business was a
bank whose name indicated that they were in a town at least two hours
away from their actual destination.</p>
<p>Jessica dove from the driver's seat, out of the car, and circled around
to Faye's side. She ripped the door away. Her knees crashed to the
ground. Her lip squeezed painfully between white teeth, arms angled
toward her thighs so her tits surged forward in her thin, white top. "I
have something to talk about after this. Promise me we can talk once I'm
done," the curly haired girl frowned looking ready for another feeding.</p>
<p>Faye looked around. A few patrons leaving the bank had heard the
squealing car tires, seen the horrendous parking job, and were probably
wondering why some black girl was seated obediently on the asphalt next
to her vehicle. Perhaps car trouble, they thought. Something might have
sprung a leak. If only they could know how accurate that guess was about
to be.</p>
<p>Back of her fingers caressing Jessica's cheeks, Faye turned
perpendicular to the passenger seat. Her legs forced Jessica away till
they cleared, then invited her back when they spread. One shapely,
monstrous jug was so large it balanced partly on Faye's thigh as the
rest of its weight dangled for the taking. Her sweater still cloaked her
right breast, acting as a sling sufficient enough to contain only one of
Faye's planets.</p>
<p>"Sure we can talk. You're my precious girl. I always have time to talk
to you. But first a question: is this supposed to count as a milking?
Because I'm not due for one for another three hours."</p>
<p>The sides of Jessica's eyes drew inward. "God, you're this big and we
still have three hours to wait? You'll be as big as the car if we wait
that long. Look," she cupped both her hands to Jessica's exposed skin,
positioning one diminutive paw on each side of Faye's divinely feminine
glory. "You're still producing --- I can <em>see</em> you getting bigger and
bigger. Mmm, you're insane. Your body is just. . . there is no way you
should make me feel this good just looking at you."</p>
<p>Faye felt herself swelling, glutting, stuffing. Where she usually
conducted herself with lightness, now, her existence was weighty and
substantial. Lower and lower her tit sank, pulling at her shoulders and
neck, angled toward the ground. In a few feet, her plump pap would
contact the ground. At her rate of growth, it would only be a matter of
minutes.</p>
<p>"See? You're speeding up --- how are you speeding up?"</p>
<p>"When you touch them they speed up. My body can tell you're close by,"
Faye leaned further forward, putting more weight and flesh into
Jessica's palms. "This is what my body was made to do."</p>
<p>"To meet demand. . ." Jessica started to sway. Her arms arched inward.
Faye's swinging boulder was guided like a wrecking ball to Jessica's
cheek where it burned with sensual fire. "Damn, there's so much in
there."</p>
<p>"You can take it," Faye stroked Jessica's puffy curls romantically. "You
can't still be full from breakfast this morning."</p>
<p>Milk shifted about in Faye's blimp of a tit, gurgling loudly. A mind of
their own, Faye sensed instinctively that her load was far too much for
Jessica, but kept the fact to herself, using it to bolster her own
already-elevated self image.</p>
<p>"I am but who cares? I want more right now." Jessica answered wantonly.
Turning her cheek, she skipped worship by kissing and drew her tongue
across Faye's burgeoning boob in complex patterns. "If I don't drink you
now, you won't fit back in the car. Fuck, you're already like three cup
sizes bigger. I <em>just</em> parked the car. You must <em>really</em> want to feed
me."</p>
<p>Wrong. Faye wanted to <em>stuff</em> her. "Latch on. I'll show you how bad I
want to feed you."</p>
<p>Coaxed on by a spirit of mystery and lust, the caramel girl ducked under
Faye's dangling treat. Her neck angled upward and her face took the
weight of all of Faye's girlish flesh. Nipple angled, bulging lewdly at
her cheek, Jessica's teeth came down snuggly. They had connected. They
were one.</p>
<p>Faye's voice hitched. Perception narrowed to a dyed, rosy version,
allowing only for the space directly in front of her and ignoring the
world which felt so insignificant in comparison. Even for a nascent
goddess, which is exactly what Faye believed herself to be, she was a
slave to the ebbs and flows of her carnal nature, still bound by her
body's wish to dominate her mind with a cocktail of hormones too potent
for a typical girl. They took her to the cliff. She raised her eyes over
it and, wasting not a moment, her cravings sent her tumbling over.</p>
<p>Creamy volleys lobbed a flash flood. Jessica's cheeks bulged with the
plume of sugary brew. A single tear collected at the edge of her eye.
She blinked it away. Her throat opened, still weary and worn from the
thickness from Faye's pent up morning load but understanding of its new
fate. All of Jessica was understandingly submissive. Parts of her
willingness varied, like her stomach which signalled at her angrily when
she gulped up the first few ounces. 'I'm already full', her stomach made
warning signals as steamy piles of cream heaped themselves inside. Faye
imagined Jessica's lungs were protesting too, burning as oxygen was
starved to them, shrivelling for no reason other than to make room for
even more of Faye's copious fluid.</p>
<p>But the first swallow was always the hardest; the most abusive. Each one
following was easier as she opened herself fully to accept what Faye had
collected over time. This really was Jessica's work, Faye thought. Had
she only accepted it sooner, maybe things would have been smoother and
she never would have had to endure the momentary anguish she'd felt that
one fateful night. Why be angry? Why fuss? It didn't serve her at all.
Life was easier when she accepted that her place in the world was beside
Faye, providing for her, supporting her, and, at times, worshipping her
busty, lustful body.</p>
<p>Faye resigned to watch her body shift and change. A venue of wonder,
virile and alive with energy, her nipple stretched as viscous milk was
forced out. Her rate felt slower than usual, not nearly the explosive
force she would experience every morning, but the excitement still came
in the steadiness. How long could she keep going at that speed? Hours,
maybe, or days. Faye truly felt she could do so, she could spend <em>days</em>
milking herself. Her production was that ferocious; her body
incomparable in its relentless creation of sweet, sweet milk.</p>
<p>Even with Jessica drinking, her tautness remained. Having nowhere else
to go, her milk caused her breast to bulge to grander sizes. Domination
was embodied in Faye. Her tits no longer sought to feed or cure hunger,
but to stretch the person attached. Her milk <em>invaded</em> Jessica's body
and claimed it --- no inch was left untouched.</p>
<p>"Jessy! You can suck harder than that, can't you? C'mon, harder!
<em>Harder!</em>" Faye teased.</p>
<p>Her partner opened wide and clamped down on her bulgy, smooth areola.
The pressure was pleasant on her nerves there, making Faye moan. She
heard Jessica growling and gargling. The act had rewarded her with even
more milk flow, a blast that formed rivers at the sides of her mouth
that fell to her top. Tits that had seen their own growth over the
course of a month clung to Jessica's clothing. Each new drip revealed a
new area, like raindrops in a pond forming ripples that collide.</p>
<p>Jessica whimpered as Faye's fingers went to her breasts, teasing the
nipples that were adamantly hard. "Something tells me," Faye looked
Jessica in the eye, noting how cute she looked with milk-stuffed cheeks.
"If you keep drinking me, you'll start producing milk yourself. Wouldn't
it be amazing if we <em>both</em> were lactating? You've already gone up two
cup sizes. You must be close to making <em>something</em>, right?"</p>
<p>A woman and a child presumed to be her son jumped into their car about
ten feet away. The boy looked with intrigue till his mother tossed him
into the car like luggage and sped away. Faye giggled, continuing on,
noting a pleasure she got from making people uncomfortable. "Mmm, they
feel so <em>tight</em>. Are you getting bigger like me? I bet you are. It would
be so <em>sexy</em> seeing you spray some milk while you drink all of mine."</p>
<p>The request was now in the air. Like all the others, it one day would
come true.</p>
<p>Faye's blend washed over her nurser's tongue and punched out her throat.
Creamy, rich smells were in the air like an expensive lotion or perfume
and Jessica looked to be dreaming of having her own scent one day.
Finally, most vividly, she squeezed the sides of Faye's boob, fathoming
the impossibility that she was still growing, and wished the same for
herself.</p>
<p>"Mmmmn, that's so amazing, babe! Keep sucking, don't stop!" Faye said
huskily. Her hand on Jessica's left nipple was encouragement, though for
whom wasn't clear. Her right jug, the one balanced on her thigh, had
finally grown too unstable and slumped down, crashing into her left one
like a wrecking ball. Its size was great enough to send Faye tumbled out
of the car, onto the ground tits first. She yelped as she landed, but
not from pain since her chest made an amazing cushion.</p>
<p>Beneath her writhed Jessica, though, who had no doubt taken the more
significant fall.</p>
<p>"Shit! Babe, you okay?" Faye rocked herself. Her body was awkward at
this size, and heavier than it appeared. She found the leverage she
needed in a few seconds and she rose to check on her fiancée. "Jessica?"</p>
<p>Jessica gasped. Once her head was exposed, she blinked her eyes open.
After taking in what had happened herself, an accepting aura toured her
features. "Being crushed by your tits. . . is the best thing that has
ever happened to me."</p>
<p>"What the hell! I was actually worried about you!" Faye's reaction was
to feel like the victim, despite her own body being the cause of this
incident.</p>
<p>"I know, I know. Sorry to worry my goddess fiancée," Jessica raised her
eyebrows.</p>
<p>The girls repositioned. Faye sat on her knees off to Jessica's right,
hands resting atop her bosom. One of her twins was spilling over her lap
and the other leaned happily atop Jessica's thigh and hip. There seemed
to be nowhere for them to go with their size and their insistence in
jiggling made things sexy, for better or worse.</p>
<p>"Gosh, we're gonna be <em>so</em> late getting to the house," Faye pointed out.</p>
<p>Jessica, undeterred by the accident, sat up and squeezed Faye's sweater
covered breast. "If we don't milk you, you won't be able to fit through
the door. As far as I can tell," she seemed distracted by how jiggly and
fun Faye's titty was to touch and slosh about. "Our only option is to,
well, continue."</p>
<p>"I think some of my milk lost its way and ended up in your brain."</p>
<p>"I'm not surprised. It gets <em>everywhere</em>."</p>
<p>Faye's left tit was still leaking, sprinkling the ground with a fan of
milk from her nipple. Her enormous buoy of a breast expanded in all
directions, eclipsing her thick, luscious thighs with ease, swelling
onto the parking lot completely exposed.</p>
<p>"It's like they want everyone to know they're the biggest," Jessica
commented. "The biggest, fullest tits in the whole world."</p>
<p>Faye nodded voiceless, watching herself grow and grow, an unstoppable
force of female sexuality.</p>
<p>"I'd like to get started again, if you'd be so kind as to unpin me
completely."</p>
<p>"I don't know," Faye said, sadistically. "I kinda like feeling you
struggle under me. . ."</p>
<p>"<em>Later,</em> babe," Jessica answered, foreshadowing what was sure to come
the moment they had the privacy of a bedroom.</p>
<p>Though, if they were willing to nurse gallons of breast milk parked in
front of a bank, was it such a stretch to take the next logical step?
Perhaps, but who could tell where an hour's worth of milking would lead
them?</p>
<p>_____</p>
<p>Move In Day, Later</p>
<p>Faye</p>
<p>"If you two lovely ladies need anything else, be sure to give me a call.
My card's in the kitchen next to the welcome basket."</p>
<p>"Thanks so much," Jessica blanketed her body over Faye, clearly
exhausted. Even without the edge of attentiveness, she was putting forth
the effort to be polite.</p>
<p>"I'll be contacting you all throughout the week just to be sure
everything is to your liking. Really, if there's anything at all, never
hesitate. My goal is to be the friend that actually shows up on moving
day, alright?"</p>
<p>"We've got a few things that may need some moving. . ." Faye insinuated
her breasts further into the conversation, hoisting them higher than
they already were. When Marcus unabashedly gawked, Faye knew he'd gotten
the point. "But not tonight. It's late and it was a long ride over."</p>
<p>Marcus, the guy from the mall who was building homes in the next town
over. Faye had actually contacted him again and sweet talked him into a
steal of a home: two floors, four bedrooms, three full baths, and more
square footage than any couple could make full use of. One bedroom would
serve as the music room. Another, preferably the one with walk-in bath,
would be the blond's 'office'. Everything the two needed was there ---
and more.</p>
<p>The representative from the HOA was twenty-something with a clean, low
haircut, and evidently a bust-loving man. He'd talked exclusively to
Faye's tits and deflated when she clarified that his help wouldn't be
needed that night. He'd <em>actually</em> thought he was going to get some tail
--- his magazine perfect smile canted disappointedly to prove it. Move
in night may not have been the night for such activities, but that
didn't disqualify other days of the week, the blond thought. She'd done
all but go down on him to get them the house and he'd grow frustrated if
she never put out.</p>
<p>Her whole life was about balancing people to serve her best, so reading
his expectations came second nature. She had about three weeks to give
him what she'd been teasing. That was plenty of time. Once things
settled down, Marcus would think he'd gotten away with the better deal.
And better yet, he'd be in her corner for when she sought to make future
changes to the home.</p>
<p>Faye made sure he was certain of this with an abbreviated shimmy that
rolled over her full hips and into her tits which tossed like ships on a
stormy sea.</p>
<p>Marus swallowed hard. Faye wished it was a mouthful of her addictive
milk making his adam's apple sink. "Pleasure seeing you two again.
C-congratulations." He backed his way out the door, then turned on the
porch and hopped down the stairs.</p>
<p>Jessica made a move to the door, but Faye stopped her. Watching him
leave, making sure the last of this thoughts were of the impossibly sexy
couple that had moved into the neighborhood, was a point of leverage
Faye would not let pass.</p>
<p>"He's cute," Faye said, eyes glowing as headlights brightened their
doorway. "And so helpful."</p>
<p>Jessica snarled, turning closer to Faye. "Too scrawny for me. For you as
well, right?"</p>
<p>Hand on a journey, Faye's fingers traced the outline of Jessica's
stomach. The bulge there was brand new. It objected to her previously
tidy middle, denying the very notion that Jessica had ever had a flat
stomach. She was clearly sexier with a pregnant belly, one roiling with
a whirlpool of Faye's milk. Any message of the contrary was a lie, as
far as Faye could tell. "You're right," she finally admitted after she'd
had her fill of pinching Jessica's smooth, round milk ball. "I like my
partners full-bodied; one way or another."</p>
<p>Jealous Jessica dissipated. All that was left was a cuddlesome, sleepy
future wife. "That makes us perfect together, 'cause curves are
mandatory on my sexual partners."</p>
<p>"Are my curves to your liking?"</p>
<p>"Hmm," Jessica scooped Faye's tit up in her hand. It was too heavy to
truly lift, so she jostled it about some so Faye's cleavage line
slithered in the button-down top. "You know, they might be a little
small. We'll wait an hour or so and then they'll be better."</p>
<p>"You greedy little thing!" Faye teased, pulling Jessica in by her ass
and pressing their lips together.</p>
<p>After having milked for an hour outside the bank, a security guard
stopped getting off to their display and asked them to vacate the
premises. Disturbing the peace, or something. Whatever law they were
violating by putting on the lesbian love display of the century, they
weren't charged or fined and were on their way in a few minutes. Faye
made sure to get the officer's name, making friends like she always did
when she met a person that could do her a 'favor' in a pinch.</p>
<p>It took all day to get to their new home, to have a tour, to fill out
paperwork, and to be left alone. The sun had been set for almost an
hour, day yielding to night at just the right time for Faye and
Jessica's liking.</p>
<p>They swapped each other's love and attention with their waltzing
tongues, bodies roaming over what they had each made of each other. The
two surfaced for air nearly five minutes later, realizing that they
could have continued making out for hours and hours in the very spot
that Marcus had left them. What drew them apart at the mouth but not at
their sensually chained bodies was an even deeper yearning.</p>
<p>"It's that time again," Faye whispered, flipping her blonde hair as her
front teeth raked lines down Jessica's neck.</p>
<p>The blonde's full expectation was another good time --- their first good
time in this new space that would, day by day, feel more like home. She
was surprised to find her smaller partner frozen. The body beneath her
lips did react, except a stiffness made for an awkward taste to what was
supposed to be a dream come true.</p>
<p>"Something the matter?" Faye pulled up slowly.</p>
<p>Those green eyes were closed; brow furrowed. "I meant to talk to you.
You promised you'd hear me out."</p>
<p>"I did. It just seems like a weird time for this." Faye couldn't even
hold Jessica straight on without smothering her to death in her
nearly-full tits. She spoke sweetly to the shorter girl, left arm around
her shoulder in a side hug. "You do see that I'm full and we're alone in
our new home, right? Don't you want to try out the bed? Or the couch or
the table or the stairs? I'd like to try you out everywhere."</p>
<p>Faye smirked, watching the her wife-to-be fight with herculean might the
simplicity of fucking themselves to a lust-drunken stupor then nursing
till morning.</p>
<p>"No. This needs to be said. It should have been said before but I-I let
my physical needs get in the way."</p>
<p>"Alright then. Let's hear it."</p>
<p>Faye listened half-heartedly. She mostly focused on removing the
clothing that was gripping her body like a second skin. Jessica sat on
their new, fluffy white couch --- unwilling audience to the strip tease
of the century.</p>
<p>"Going back to before, I do think I'm jealous of you." Jessica's thighs
were thicker and much more attractive when they squeezed tight to both
hold back and excite her lower lips. "Your body for sure. I think you're
the most beautiful woman alive. But also your success --- your self-made
success. Your a career woman with dreams and ambition."</p>
<p>"And I told you, so are you! This is our dream come true."</p>
<p>Jessica shrank a little at that. "Actually, Faye, I don't think it is."</p>
<p>Faye chortled. "Baby girl, of course it is! The nice home, the fully
furnished kitchen, the music room. We can shop for dogs tomorrow if you
want. We'll do it from bed while we drink alcohol and enjoy our full,
luscious bodies."</p>
<p>Jessica had a wave of anticipation roll over her so strong it looked to
nearly knocked her over. "Oh god," the moan came without permission.</p>
<p>"Exactly. Now come here," Faye spread out her arms. She fully
anticipated another win, another success. Jessica could finally see
things her way now that they were literally living their dream right?
Great house, great jobs, great sex, great life.</p>
<p>But Jessica didn't moved. It looked like she was shackled to the couch
--- the only way she wouldn't have submitted.</p>
<p>"I-I'm not finished. Faye, there's a lot about this I don't like. I
always saw myself marrying you, but I imagined it being a partnership;
you give a little, I give a little, we both make a little work for both
of us. I imagined myself stronger and more successful than I am --- and
no, not a strong lactation specialist, or whatever. Strong, like
self-secure. I wanted my future to reflect all the hard work I'd done to
make it my future."</p>
<p>Faye squinted, seeing that Jessica found a voice somewhere that gave her
strength to defy her hyper-sexual nature. "And this isn't it? I thought
this was your dream."</p>
<p>"It's the dream you handed me. Working a job you created in a home you
paid for with a body you acquired. Yes, baby, this is everything I want
--- I'm surrounded by everything I want! I'm just not satisfied. I'll
never be the way things are going because I'll always have a little
voice inside that's whispering to me: you're nothing special, you just
<em>married</em> special."</p>
<p>"You're being really insecure right now." Faye didn't realize how much
hurt was in her voice till it was already in the air. "Who cares which
one of us succeeds? Being together means reaching the mountain top
together. Here we are, Jessy!" Faye gestured with her open palms at the
space around them --- so much space, almost too much. "It isn't about
who was special. We're here together now. Doesn't that matter more?"</p>
<p>Jessica stood. It almost looked like she'd given up her little speech.
"It might. But that's not what I feel. I feel like that baby in Grace's
stroller on our date night. It's nice being treated like I'm everything,
but it's only cute if it's a baby being coddled. I'm a woman for fuck's
sake! My heart won't let me be strolled around like I have been."
Jessica came forward, emboldened by this rebellious spirit, approaching
the colossal woman Faye was with the audacity to speak toe to toe with
entitlement. "Please understand, Faye. I've quit my job, lost my figure,
betrayed my conscience by watching you get away with so much. But I have
nothing to show for my own sacrifices --- no reward for taking the easy
way out. We fuck like champions together, but I don't feel like a
champion of life when we're done. Does that make sense."</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>The blond grabbed Jessica by her shoulders, a little too rough. "Faye,
h-hey! What're you-. . ."</p>
<p>"How do you think it makes me feel when you say that? After all I did
--- I sacrificed too! For you. See this?" Faye's hand lifted Jessica's,
indicating the sizable white diamond contrasting her caramel skin.
"That's what this ring means: sacrifice. I sacrifice so I can make you
happy. If you tell me you aren't happy with me literally making your
dreams a reality then. . ."</p>
<p>"I think you convinced yourself that this was what I wanted." Jessica
hung her head. "And I was too scared or complacent or <em>something</em>. I
never stopped you. I thought I'd be a fool to. You're perfect and I
should be gracious to have you. But this just isn't right and it's time
I admit it --- before I end up lifeless and bitter and I push you away
like Ms. Hightower did."</p>
<p>Faye blinked slowly, a thought behind her blue eyes. "So Sally's the one
who put you up to this."</p>
<p>The younger girl seemed to catch her words. She talked through the
point. "So what I want is for you to let me do some things on my own. I
just need an area in life where I can feel like I'm genuinely making a
difference. What do you think?"</p>
<p>"I think a middle-aged woman lost her best worker and used whatever she
could to make her feel guilty about leaving."</p>
<p>"Faye! Don't even go there. Sally's Diner paid the bills before you had
your first contract. That woman and her restaurant is the reason we're
here today."</p>
<p>"And she'd like to take the credit by keeping you there. That's what she
wants --- I bet she said that 'nobody would ever replace you'. Some worn
out old phrase like that. She's brainwashed you. Sally's a lonely old
woman without any kids of her own. Yea, and she thinks of you like a
daughter that I'm stealing away."</p>
<p>Jessica, after being quiet long enough to hear where Faye was going,
tore away from the statuesque blond with tits swinging nearly two feet
in front. "Faye, that isn't Ms. Hightower. If anything, that sounds like
something you would do."</p>
<p>Faye snarled. "Wow. Really? You actually have to be brainwashed. That
lady is selfish and she thinks she can steal away my precious girl for
herself-"</p>
<p>"I'm nobody's 'girl'. I'm a woman."</p>
<p>"You're <em>my</em> woman." Faye reached out to grab Jessica.</p>
<p>Jessica tore away again. "Not if you're going to keep treating me like a
baby. I can take care of myself."</p>
<p>"Why won't you let me take care of you? What's so wrong with that? I
know you're strong, it's why I want to marry you."</p>
<p>"Maybe I need to prove that to myself before I'm ready to get married."</p>
<p>Faye lost something with those words. It was like the world she'd set up
for success was slipping away beneath some black horizon. She'd been in
control in every corner of her life. Was she about to lose the final,
most important piece of it? "So we're done then?"</p>
<p>Jessica seemed to just realize where the argument had escalated. Faye
watched, hoping for some crack in this ignorant wall her love had
erected between them; a chink in the armor, a vulnerability. There was
only one.</p>
<p>"I need a break," Jessica whispered.</p>
<p>"Then take it with me."</p>
<p>Faye lunged in. She was clumsy and mad with a kiss. She forced Jessica
to grope her breasts, exchanging her warmth in an attempt to win over
that last prevailing part of the Jessy she loved. For a few awkward
seconds there was nothing. Then, motion. Following came a moan. Then
emerald eyes glittered with carnal satisfaction and Faye knew she'd
reached that sexual haven where she could do no wrong.</p>
<p>"C'mon," Faye spoke through their kiss. She hefted her precious girl
into her arms and took her into the darkness of the second floor.</p>
<p>Once there she found the bedroom and nearly tripped carrying them both
inside. They clung to each other and fell into the king sized bed. A
patio outside could be seen through a sliding glass door. Without
curtains, the moon bore witness to her daughters mixing their love and
passions into a steamy, feminine concoction like they'd never done
before. Tan flesh became one endlessly with fevered pink. They both
delivered and received outstanding oral followed by a lustful grinding
fit in a dance so spontaneous yet so very familiar. They made a mess of
their new room, didn't stop till the pillows and the sheets were theirs.
The television, the dresser, the rug, the windows, the bookshelf, the
nightstand, the open closet door, and the bathroom. The sex was the type
that made any surroundings feel like home sweet home.</p>
<p>"I'm thirsty," Jessica wheezed.</p>
<p>"Here I come."</p>
<p>Faye come to the head of the bed and laid on her side. She pulled the
livewire that was Jessy close so they could face one another. A massive
tower of titty was stacked up before her, but the younger girl didn't
wink once out of apprehension.</p>
<p>"There. You can start when you like," Faye said, holding the space where
waist abated to hip. As she spoke her invitation, she felt her nipples
stretching longer. "See? They're ready just for you. They only do that
when you're here."</p>
<p>"I'm always honored," Jessica said.</p>
<p>When there was a pause, Faye spoke up. "Something the matter?"</p>
<p>"No. Everything's just fine." Her voice seemed distant.</p>
<p>Laying down, Faye's body took up a third of the bed, then her tits the
second third, so sounding distant was a matter of space for sure. But,
in the heat of love, the blond elected to leave the wistful tone alone.</p>
<p>She knew she was right when she felt Jessica latch on. Lips sank in
tight and her nipple sat heavy along the length of a hot, wet tongue.
Her built up supply let down in a quantity that would have made a normal
girl choke. Jessy was well equipped for such quantities, though. She
could chug gallons of heavy cream without being fazed.</p>
<p>Faye felt momentary back up in her fiancée's throat. Then it passed and
sweet, heavy glugging adopted a rhythm. Not a drop went to waste. Her
breast unloaded, liters at a time it seemed, to her full satisfaction.
No sooner, her hormones drowned her brain and the edges of her vision
swam. She closed her aqua eyes and instinctively held Jessica even
closer.</p>
<p>She'd won. Again, as she expected, she'd won. Her life was in her hands
again. Just as she suspected, her partner just didn't fully understand
what was at stake and, once they started snacking on milk and pussy, it
changed Jessy's tune. There they lay, life partners, nursing and bonding
as sweetly as they did three months prior. It stood to reason that now,
with Z cups --- only speculation, as she'd been unable to measure
herself --- that the nursing could go on for longer, as could the
bonding and the love.</p>
<p>Unaware of how tired she'd become from marathon sex with tons of excess
milk weight, Faye submitted to rest. The final thought on her mind was
how amazing her tits were, that no matter what obstacle she'd
encountered she'd used her body like a swiss army knife in fixing
everything.</p>
<p>When she awoke, it was due to her tits aching beside her. Several
milkings had to have been missed. When the goddess sought for her mate,
she only found more bed beside her. In a hazy lumber, she came upright
and her mammoth boobage slammed the freezing hardwood floor. In the
corner of her eye, barely even there, was a folded piece of paper and a
gorgeous diamond ring.</p>
<p>_____</p>
<p>Jessy's Bistro</p>
<p>One Year Later</p>
<p>Jessica</p>
<p>"Thank you so much for this. She eats a lot more than her brother does.
I could maybe make enough for her if he wasn't so picky about using a
sippy cup."</p>
<p>Grace sat in comfy iron chair with blue cushioning at a stonetop round
table. In the top, broken ceramic pieces were set to resemble a view.
This one was of a cabin with a chimney. Grace didn't seem to care much
for scenery. The new mom was bouncing a healthy toddler over her
shoulder. He was making a single-toned song that seemed to be for his
very own entertainment.</p>
<p>Jessica was sitting across from them. In her arms was Grace's newest
daughter, Lily. The baby girl was blinking in and out of a morning nap,
head tilted wearily against the tanned woman.</p>
<p>"It's the least I could do. It's not like I have a kid of my own. All my
milk goes to waste without you taking a few ounces."</p>
<p>"Still, my nipples are in your debt. Seriously." Grace winked.</p>
<p>Jessica, for reasons she barely understood, felt herself going hot under
the collar. "Can I get you something to go? Maybe something for their
father?"</p>
<p>"He's off on one of his binges again. Hasn't been home in a few weeks."</p>
<p>"You poor thing."</p>
<p>"Pfft! I'll make it. I was on my own when I met you for the first time,
remember? Same deal. The only thing I regret is having the kids grow up
without two stable parents." Grace held Jessica's gaze for a bit.
"You're the most stable thing in their lives to be honest. Lily's
basically being fed by your breast milk."</p>
<p>"I hope she doesn't get any ideas. I'm just her godmother, not the real
thing." Jessica held the child, dreaming of the strong young woman
little Lily would be if she kept drinking so much milk.</p>
<p>"Wouldn't be the worst thing for her to think. You're a better parent
than their father. I certainly like you better." Grace shrugged the
shoulder with her one year old on it. "Getting kinda tired of dick
anyway."</p>
<p>Jessica opened her mouth in giddy shock. "You didn't just say that in
front of your kids. You're crazy!"</p>
<p>"Dick is their father! Wow, someone's brain is in the gutter this
morning."</p>
<p>Jessica raised an eyebrow. An older version of herself would have felt
bad about that. Now, she had her own bistro, her own friends, and an
honest way of living. She was living her truth. "Sure is. But it ain't
sunshine and rainbows. Trust me."</p>
<p>"I don't." Grace rose, shifting her son onto her hip. "I'll have to
schedule a trip sometime. Maybe after I drop these two off at my
mother's place. You'll have to be understanding, I haven't been intimate
with a girl since college."</p>
<p>Jessica rose as well. "Aren't you still technically in college?"</p>
<p>"Night school. Now, give me Lily. You have a store to open!"</p>
<p>Jessica did just that and helped Grace make the transfer of kids to from
public space to five-star safety rated SUV. The emerald-eyed woman
handed a cooler last which was filled with the morning's pumped breast
milk and waved goodbye. Briefly she looked across the street and saw
Sally sweeping off the sidewalk about a block down. The middle-aged
woman tilted her head in a nod which filled Jessica with everything she
needed to turn and swagger boldly into her own eatery.</p>
<p>It wasn't much yet. Her menu was small but flexible. Her sit in dining
was limited with only enough seating for about sixteen. She'd got the
place mainly because of the alley-side patio which was secluded and cool
for those wanting to sit outside. One day, she'd have a band playing
live out there. For the time being, she could only play her favorite
tunes softly over the speakers; ukulele music by a local artist.</p>
<p>She felt true satisfaction at her simple, lovely, honest life.</p>
<p>It hadn't been easy. Leaving Faye was the hardest thing she'd ever done
--- in every sense. She was still conflicted as she walked away. Really,
she more so wobbled as her belly was so full of milk it basically
constituted another human being by size. The cab she heralded several
miles from the house kept insisting she go to a hospital, but he'd
reluctantly dropped her off at Sally's.</p>
<p>She explained what happened and Sally who, though bewildered, was
understanding. She lived in with the middle-aged worker for a few days,
digesting what was the biggest belly she'd ever seen. Then, Jessica went
about righting every wrong committed by Faye. She apologized to their
old landlord for late rent, to Marcus who sold a house at a tremendous
loss because he thought he might fuck a goddess, to the attendant at the
lingerie shop for putting her through so much trouble just to not buy a
single bra.</p>
<p>And she apologized to Grace, admitting she wasn't pregnant and how she
felt guilt for going along with the lie. Grace, of all the people, was
the most forgiving.</p>
<p>As it turned out, honesty was the remedy. The Landlord forgave back
rent, Marcus found the property that became Jessy's Bistro, Sally taught
Jessica how to run an eatery, and Grace became an invaluable friend ---
and maybe more? Even the breast milk, which started when she finished
digesting a dozen gallons of Faye's thick cream, had a purpose now. It
was so perfect how simple life became; not easy, but simple.</p>
<p>And lovely, and honest.</p>
<p>Jessy had the whole bistro open and ready for business at seven sharp.
Her handmade pastries were on display and fresh coffee in five different
varieties were ready to be poured. She adjusted her boobs just right and
felt no guilt of looking sluttish. That had been part of an insecurity
that was disappearing too --- that she was just a sex craved, lust
dominated nymph. Now, sex had its proper role in her life --- a vibrant
and active role. And her J cup breasts not only helped her find new
partners but gave her the chance to be little Lily's wet nurse.</p>
<p>The bell above the door tingled. "Morning! Welcome to Jessy's Bistro!"
First customer of the day.</p>
<p>"Hey," came a familiar voice.</p>
<p>Jessica stopped daydreaming about Grace's full, milky breasts and
trademark mommy hips to take notice of the figure in the door. Six-six,
tits too big to fit through the door, and hair so long it dusted the
floor even when in a ponytail?</p>
<p>"Faye?"</p>
<p>It was. Faye had come to find her.</p>
<p>The talk was a lengthy one frequently interrupted by the regulars who
came in to start their days at Jessy's. Most knew nothing of Faye and
skittered away with their food and drink out of the intimidation of so
much woman, which was well and good as it left the two alone.</p>
<p>"I'm proud. You're doing so well for yourself," Faye said at one point.</p>
<p>"Thank you."</p>
<p>"I didn't know you were this ambitious. You could very well open up a
chain of bistros one day."</p>
<p>"I'll start with just this one."</p>
<p>"You've had a busy morning. I bet sales are very good."</p>
<p>"Why are you here, Faye?" Jessica turned to the titan. "I left you that
note for a reason. I told you I need space. We're done. I have a date
today and everything."</p>
<p>"Grace? Yea, she told me you two were getting flirty," Faye talked to
her sandals. "That you lactate now and feed her daughter, that she
thinks your cute and a good influence, that you're an amazing woman.
Yes, yes, I've heard it all. When I get worried about you, the only way
I can check up on you is through her."</p>
<p>"Back to manipulating people, then?"</p>
<p>"No! No." Faye steadied herself, finding a peace in some kernel of
thought. "No, I talk to Grace because I wanted to make amends first. She
just happens to be friendly and open enough to talk to me about you."</p>
<p>"Look, I need to get back to work. Faye, I-"</p>
<p>"Hear me out. It'll be quick." Faye came to the counter like she might
leap over it.</p>
<p>Jessica stood still and beheld her almost-wife. "Okay."</p>
<p>"I'm not here to try to win you back. I clearly messed up, I can take
the blame. I deserved to have you leave me that night because I wasn't
being attentive to your needs. You deserve that in partner." Faye
squinted her eyes before the moisture in them showed. "But I do care for
you. And I've stayed away as long as I could stand to. Not as a wife,
but as a <em>friend</em> --- Jessy, I just want to be part of your life again."</p>
<p>How the hell did the tables turn like this? Jessica had never seen Faye
beg for anything. She'd always been able to get whatever she wanted.
Then, Jessica realized that the one thing Faye really wanted was
something that couldn't be taken. It could only be given, and this new
version of Faye seemed repentant enough to at least be trusted with it
provisionally.</p>
<p>It took courage, but Jessica nodded her head and flattened her frizzy
curls. "On the condition that I meet the real you, I'd like to start
over as friends." The smaller girl watched her ex-fianceé bow into the
counter in tears. Her immense breasts spread and almost overtook the
cash register. An empty tip jar nearly met its demise before Jessica
nabbed it out of thin air.</p>
<p>"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you." Came weepy, sincere cries. Faye's
blue eyes leaked, eyes that matched the colors in Jessy's Bistro
exactly. "I won't ruin this. I won't. Thank you."</p>
<p>Jessica came forward and held Faye as best she could. Despite how much
there was of her new friend, she couldn't help but feel like the bigger
person.</p>
<p>_____</p>
<p>Bad End</p>
<p>Faye</p>
<p>They swapped each other's love and attention with their waltzing
tongues, bodies roaming over what they had each made of each other. The
two surfaced for air nearly five minutes later, realizing that they
could have continued making out for hours and hours in the very spot
that Marcus had left them. What drew them apart at the mouth but not at
their sensually chained bodies was an even deeper yearning.</p>
<p>"It's that time again," Faye whispered, flipping her blonde hair as her
front teeth raked lines down Jessica's neck. "You have enough space in
you for more?"</p>
<p>"Thank god," Jessica swooned. "I'm already famished. I hoped the milking
at the bank was just an appetizer."</p>
<p>Jessica's mention of 'appetizers', brought even more tension to a beaten
and bloodied battle between a goddess' tits and mankind's best efforts
at concealing them. Faye's chest lengthened, filling the space below her
ribs, casting a shadow over her belly button. Her top looked like
children's clothes on her, hanging on by two buttons and riding up to
resemble swimwear. Her hip-to-bust ratio was too outlandish for
imagination yet too perfect to exist in reality. Faye almost believed
she was on the cusp of something new and inexplicable.</p>
<p>"<em>Fuck</em>, you little glutton," Faye's eyes glinted with lust.</p>
<p>Jessica raised an eyebrow, challenging the force of nature before her.
"I see they like it when I talk about how much I need them to make more
and more. It's like all they know how to do is make you bigger and
bigger. . ."</p>
<p>"You talk a big game for a girl with one load already in the oven."</p>
<p>"I don't think you get it yet," Jessica shoved as much of herself
between Faye's whoppers. Her face and shoulders vanished. Her breasts
were pressed flat against the grander, sexier force. Despite her
efforts, Faye's milk production kept her breasts firm and taut. There
was a little give, but not much. No matter how she wanted to use them as
pillows, Faye's chest had already made the transition to milk factories.
Play time was over. "I want every drop. At first I thought I was jealous
because your buyers got all the milk. I thought 'if I could just have my
share, then I'd feel better about her shipping gallons away'. But that
wasn't true. I don't just want 'my share'. It isn't enough. Neither is
splitting it fifty-fifty. I want <em>all</em> your milk --- full loads again
and again."</p>
<p>Faye smirked at her fiance making wedding vows between her tits. Her
goal had finally come fully to fruition. Her dream for the future had
materialized. The dream of her own breast milk business booming with
growth as well as her dream of being her own boss. Finally, Jessica's
piece of the puzzle fell into place. The girl who had wanted to avoid
breast milk in the beginning, the one with cold, lifeless zombie hands
during her first milking, was now enslaved to the power of Faye's
colossal boobies.</p>
<p>A strain could be heard, then a pop. Another button failed.</p>
<p>"Won't you fill me up? For real. Not just a percentage. Whatever you
were going to ship off tomorrow, I want it. Now."</p>
<p>"You want it now, baby?" Faye's succubus arose from within her. "I'll
have to lie about why it's late."</p>
<p>"Do whatever you have to do. Nobody could stay angry at you, Faye.
You're just too. . . you're just. . ." Jessica, upon thinking of the
perfect word to describe her immaculate partner, moaned as loudly as she
could and buried her face till all that remained was a tuft of black
hair sticking up from Faye's valley.</p>
<p>"F-fuck!" Faye howled, enduring the wildfire burning anywhere her tits
were touched. Each were already nearing truck tires for size and
pressing even further. "Come here. Give me those sexy lips of yours."</p>
<p>Jessica didn't delay. Up she popped, jaw slack, tongue out. Obedient to
a fault, she lowered onto a single knee as if she was the one proposing
instead of Faye. Her receptacle open and clear for occupancy, Faye
couldn't help but proceed to claim the territory she'd been eyeing. Her
right nipple was as long as a hand from heel to finger tip and was
bulged beautifully from excitement. Its semi-flexible nature let it bend
as the weight of the tit behind it squished the member against Jessica's
face. It throbbed with power, the nozzle behind which a lake was waiting
to be drained.</p>
<p>"Mmm, yes," Jessica's angled face curled up and into Faye's heavy tit.
The milk vat continued swelling alarmingly fast, pushing the breast
lower and lower toward the mouth that would house it for the foreseeable
evening. "That big, sexy nipple. Mmm, it smells so sweet."</p>
<p>"Gosh, you're so freaky. I love it," Faye floated her tit meat upward
then let it fall and slap against Jessica's face. Without a good deal of
support, the widening mass could have crushed the tan-skinned girl
beneath it. Having command of such a power was what inspired Faye's
fervidity. The longer she let her nipple bend and flex against Jessica's
soft cheeks and pouty lips, the more arousing domination she had access
to. "Go on, beg. Tell me what you want. Don't stop til you get it."</p>
<p>"Faye\~ Please, Faye. You have the biggest, sexiest, most undeniable
boobs ever. I'd do anything," she paused, french kissing Faye's nozzle.
"<em>Anything</em> to have your milk in me. Fill me up, Faye. Don't stop till
your empty. Lactate till you can't anymore --- all of it, stuffing my
tight, little tummy."</p>
<p>"Shiiiit," Faye was losing it.</p>
<p>Her top was like silly string being pulled asunder. One stubborn button
was holding firm, but her chest was several inches further away already.
The ocean could be heard in her breast, churning angrily for release. At
the edge of her body's exaggerated eaves, a gooey dollop of milk built
till it was too heavy, the size of a fist, and splashed against
Jessica's forehead.</p>
<p>"Yes! More of that --- of your hot, yummy milk." A layer of opacity
spread across the black girl's face and body. It slicked her hair so
that it was wet and heavy. Her clothes darkened and stuck to her skin.
Out of Faye's sight, some of her viscous milk even reached the floor
where it tumbled and became the start of a smooth, conditioner-thick
pool. "Give me permission, Faye. Stick your raging nipple down my throat
and I promise a single drop won't go to waste. Please! Let me suck your
amazing, milk machin-. . . MMPH!"</p>
<p><em>BLLLLGRRRPT!</em></p>
<p>"Ahh, right there! That's the perfect spot," Faye threw her head back.
Her fingers combed her hair as she felt her body releasing.</p>
<p>The first mass of her raunchy essence abused Jessica's throat. The wad
that started off the flow of milk was backed up and extra rich, forcing
Jessica's body to contort obtusely around it. Beyond that point, there
was no break at all. Faye's chest turned out another bulky load, then
another, producing a stream of connected pockets of milk. With her
nipple so long and bulging around her milk flow, the scene resembled an
injection of all-natural body stuffing more so than a breastfeeding
session. Still, dwelling in these obscene extremes was a reminder to
Faye at how superior she and her body was.</p>
<p>A minute later, Faye found a brief respite between her throes. "You feel
wonderful, babe. Work your sexy lips and tongue some more. I think you
might be taking more than ever before."</p>
<p><em>BLLLGRRPT! BLLLGRRPT!</em></p>
<p>To spite the suggestion that her breasts could ever be conquered, off
went the final button. It pinged off the far wall. The sleeves of the
shirt fell slack on Faye's shoulders. The final remnants of the
tenacious top were a mess of scattered gray strips on the floor.</p>
<p>"Whoops, nevermind," Faye grinned evilly. "Guess you'd better drink
<em>faster</em>."</p>
<p>As they grew, her tits pushed away from her body even more. Jessica was
forced to roll to keep pace with a nipple that was moving inches away.
She went from being on a knee to sitting cross-legged. The milk-obsessed
girl felt her bloating tummy punch forward. Her lap became a holster for
her chocolate covered cream puff that started out as a mostly
disguisable bump and progressed to some overfed boulder.</p>
<p><em>BLLLLGRRRPT!</em></p>
<p>The siren song of milk distending a throat and piling up in a big, sexy
tummy echoed through the room.</p>
<p>Jessica moaned with every spare breath. She was as accepting as could be
--- even encouraging with her steamy actions. Even if she was barely in
control enough to comply, her tongue did struggle around the girth of
Faye's nipple. Her pillowy gates were stretched round the ambrosia
delivery system too, keeping her promise of never spilling a drop. Any
other girl would have backed up already, but sheer determination with
some experience with milk bloat gave Jessica the skill to keep the
milking as sexy and functional as possible.</p>
<p>Faye acknowledge Jessica's efforts. But, inside, she knew they weren't
enough. Her feet were planted, but Jessy was getting farther away. About
five minutes into the milking, her breasts had not stopped growing. At a
staggering speed, they pushed Jessica onto her butt, then onto her back.
Soon, the waterbed breast was a dominating top to the brown girl's
submissive bottom. Inside, milk swirled like a washing machine.</p>
<p>"You're still lagging, sweety. If you think they'll stop just because
your tummy is so huge and soft, you'd better think again," Faye teased.</p>
<p>Breasts like Faye's were too much for anyone, though. Faye knew her
body. It was more than supply and demand at that point. Her stuffed,
flooding mammaries had no intention of providing just enough to please
Jessica because no amount of nectar would be enough to feed someone so
irredeemably addicted. A battle of wills was at play between woman and
nature. Jessica believed she could never be filled, and Faye's chest
operated under the assumption that they could prove her wrong. Her tits
had done just that at every possible junction.</p>
<p>So Faye leaned into her chest, one ear to the mixing sound of her
production and the other open to the romanticized sound of a girl
avoiding drowning as she clogged her body.</p>
<p>The contest of force stretched into the night. The brand new leather
couch in the living room was pressed up against the wall by the force of
Faye's untouched left breast. It climbed on the furniture like some
entitled beast and claimed the entirety of the space with its raw heft.
Then a glass end table joined it showing how Faye's mammoth rack could
rearrange furniture. She hadn't considered it that way before, but in a
way Faye's tits were members of the household. They couldn't be ignored,
were always being attended to, and suffocated any space foolish enough
to not treat them as the centerpiece.</p>
<p>Rolling her fingers in wide circles, the cares of anything other than
her expansive forms was lost to Faye. At last perception, she assumed
Jessica was still sucking away, but from some other room where her tits
had travelled without her full knowledge.</p>
<p>Just as a doorway was utterly stuffed by her wall of pink areola, Faye
curled into her own cleavage. Making the threshold of a door collapse
was just enough to push her into orgasm, and such an orgasm ---brought
on by an areola as wide as her body --- was plenty to wear her out,
sending her to sleep.</p>
<p>The next day, Faye blinked herself awake to a commotion of sorts. A few
voices swam in the fog of her perception, but her body was still heavy
and her memory hadn't fully booted up.</p>
<p>It took the voice of her life partner to be an anchor that pulled her
back to the realm of light and the living.</p>
<p>"Hey, baby. Rise and shine," Jessica sang sweetly. "I've got a surprise
for you."</p>
<p>When Faye didn't wake up right away, a smooch gave her the willingness
to open her eyes and see what gift she was about to receive.</p>
<p>"Oh, hi sexy," Faye flirted, seeing nothing but Jessica's attractive
features as she stirred. "How'd you sleep?"</p>
<p>"Like a baby, in more ways than one. Your nipple in my mouth is how I
want to sleep every night from now on."</p>
<p>That's when Faye recalled her final memories. She went to erect herself,
but couldn't move her legs. It occurred to her that she was laying down,
turned on her side.</p>
<p>"Whoops! Sorry, did you want to get up?" Jessica noticed the blond's
struggle. "Here, I'll get out of your way."</p>
<p>A grunt bent Jessica's expression. To Faye, it looked like her brown
beloved was in the gym, suspending some dumbell to build up muscle.
Then, her legs became free which directed her attention to exactly what
had been holding them in place. A chocolate monument clumped itself in a
new orientation and swung madly with its liquid weight when it was
settled. Attached to it was Jessica, whose smile was broad at Faye's
look of disbelief.</p>
<p>"Believe it or not, I've actually shrunk. You finished lactating earlier
than I thought you would," Jessica commented.</p>
<p>Faye's arms supported her torso. She watched Jessica's belly surge high
into the air. It must have been nine feet high --- and the girl was
reclined on her back! The flanks of her delicious, lady curve stretched
even further to the east and west of her peak. It was under one of these
flanks that Faye had felt warm and secure as she slept.</p>
<p>Connecting the dots, Faye looked at her chest. They sloshed about, still
jiggling from her sitting up. Their size, though, was far too modest to
be the same tits that left Jessica a tower of tummy.</p>
<p>"You drank so much that you actually shrank me?"</p>
<p>"Surprised?" Jessica mewled.</p>
<p>"In love," Faye replied.</p>
<p>The blond sashayed her hips as she inspected the space. Floor to ceiling
in half the room was just tan tummy. The floor was sticky in places
where some sweet titty brew had dried. Following the lines, it had to be
cream fresh from the brown girl's breasts, which were equal in size and
shape to Faye's own. They both occupied the realm of H cup, both now
prominent milkers as well.</p>
<p>"I'm as big as you now," Jessica sing-songed, nearly delirious with her
record breaking body.</p>
<p>"They say lovers start to look alike after a while," Faye said, coming
to kneel beside Jessica's immobile frame. "I wonder if you'll get taller
and thicker all over like I did."</p>
<p>"I hope so," the younger girl said wistfully. "I had something to tell
you, but I forgot what it was."</p>
<p>"Must not have been that important."</p>
<p>Jessica's arms rose and pulled Faye down. "Guess not."</p>
<p>The two remained there, indulging with their infinite curves. When Faye
felt her chest inflating, Jessica drank without fear of her changing
body or size. Likewise, Faye drained her partner and felt her tits surge
with growth from the hefty, creamy snack. Their cyclical breastfeeding
spiralled further and further, broken into sessions by sleep brought on
by fatigue. Faye could think of no better way to live; the two were
fully self-sufficient.</p>
<p>Jessica's tummy took nearly a week's time to reduce in size. In due
scale, she grew to meet Faye's towering six-foot-six and surpassed the
fairer woman in hip and butt size. The younger lover was eager at that
point to become a regular producer in the blond's breast milk business
allowing for even greater volumes of production and varied qualities and
tastes. Together, their love, bond, and sizes grew till they were no
longer mistakable for their previous selves. They lived out the rest of
their days together, goddesses, subsisting on little more than sex,
love, and heavy cream.</p>
<p>Besides those three, they harbored only one additional ambition: finding
other girls to addict to their milk.</p>
<p>"You know who I was thinking?"</p>
<p>"Who babe?" Faye pulled away from lapping Jessica's immense, footlong
nipple.</p>
<p>"That mother from Town Walk? Grace, I think her name was. We should get
her." Jessica finished her sentence with a smirk as she went back to
sucking Faye's own thick, milky pap in a breastfeeding sideways
sixty-nine.</p>
<p>"I love how you think, my precious girl."</p>
