<p>Perfect Girlfriend Juice </p>
<p>by Fidget</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Perfect Secretary (Part 1)</p>
<p>Alani burst out of her boss's office, trying to hold back tears after seeing just how angry Jack 
had been. She knew that it was entirely deserved - she'd double-booked him for a meeting 
again, only a few days after having already made the exact same mistake, but this time it was
with their two most important clients, and Alani knew how unorganized it made him seem.</p>
<p>And this was only the latest in a long line of similar gaffes going all the way back to her hiring 
almost a year prior. It wasn't that her secretary job was overly difficult; there were just so 
many things she needed to keep track of to keep the office running smoothly, and she'd never
been a talented multitasker in the first place. Little things soon began to fall through the 
cracks, and as patient as Jack had been with her so far, she could tell that her endless minor 
slip-ups were starting to wear on him. She wanted to do a good job, and she really needed 
the money, but she just didn't know how she'd be able to get it all done.</p>
<p>She retreated to the break room to buy an energy drink she hoped would help perk her up 
after her ordeal. Along the way she passed a blonde, oddly busty soft drink company 
employee who had just finished stocking the machine, and the strange-looking can that 
popped out after Alani put her money in was like no energy drink she'd ever seen before.</p>
<p>Too distracted by her distress to notice anything awry, she snapped open the lid on her way 
back to her desk and took a gulp without thinking anything about it, and was suddenly flooded
with a slight sensation of dizziness as she sank back into her seat. It soon passed, but was 
slowly replaced by an odd feeling of yearning as she inexplicably found herself wanting to be 
in the presence of her boss again for some reason, even though she had fled his office scant 
minutes before. The surprisingly strong urge was accompanied by a restless discomfort that 
grew the longer she resisted it, however, and so after only a few more seconds she found 
herself standing up once more.</p>
<p>Jack Davidson looked up only briefly when he noticed her enter. "Oh, Alani, I'm glad you're 
back," he said somewhat guiltily. Jack regretted having been so harsh to her, but lately, </p>
<p>despite his best efforts, his business always seemed to be falling further and further behind, 
and the strain was starting to take a toll on his usually steady nerves.</p>
<p>In his embarrassment, however, he failed to notice his homely secretary's sharp intake of 
breath as her pupils dilated and her face flushed as soon as she laid eyes on him. "I wanted 
to apologize for what happened a few minutes ago. I know that with all of the various 
responsibilities you have to stay on top of in your position, it's only natural that things would 
get overlooked every once in a while, and I shouldn't have gone off the handle like I did. Still 
though, you have to become better organized."</p>
<p>Alani, meanwhile, was finding it hard to focus on his words as she became more and more 
fixated on her boss's ruggedly handsome features, and an uncharacteristic, euphoric 
giddiness grew within her. She'd never noticed how attractive and masculine Jack was before,
but now she couldn't help but notice his sexual desirability as her body grew warm with 
pleasant, tingly arousal. When he got to the suggestion of how she could improve herself for 
him, however, her ears involuntarily perked up, and she found herself unconsciously resolving
to do just that. Even so, this simple request wasn't enough to sate the new curiosity she 
suddenly felt growing inside of her, and soon she wasn't able to prevent herself from bursting 
out with, "Mr. Davidson? I know this is an incredibly inappropriate thing to ask, but could you 
please tell me what you find attractive in women??"</p>
<p>"What? What on earth are you talking about?" Jack demanded, completely blindsided both by
the words and by the almost manic intensity of her unprompted question. Though Alani 
squirmed in pleasure as his eyes jumped back up to hers, his gaze was full of confused 
suspicion: he'd never once thought about his secretary romantically, and she'd never given 
him reason to believe she felt that way about him before either.</p>
<p>"I have to know, sir!" she continued, her outburst fueled by the inexplicable passion burning 
within her that made all concerns of social propriety pale in comparison. She knew how 
inappropriate her behavior was, but she was overwhelmed by her sudden infatuation with her 
married boss and just couldn't help herself. "I have to know what your Perfect Girlfriend would
be like!"</p>
<p>"Alani, I'm married! I don't have an idea of what my perfect girlfriend would be like, and even if
I did, I certainly wouldn't tell you! You're my employee!" Jack briefly reflected that his home life
was perfectly adequate, if not overly exciting, but then his thoughts returned to the fact that 
the last thing he needed right now was any kind of harassment suit directed at him, and so he
tried to play the situation as lowkey as possible. "Alani, just go back to your desk, and we'll 
both pretend this conversation never happened. I'm sorry I lost my temper with you earlier, 
but whatever you're doing here really isn't necessary."</p>
<p>"But sir, I... I need to know what you want me to become!" Alani persisted, confused by her 
own words, but knowing that they were somehow true all the same.</p>
<p>"In that case, just worry about becoming my perfect secretary," Jack concluded with a 
disarming grin that sent pleasant tingles up and down Alani's spine. "Our relationship should </p>
<p>be strictly professional. Now go back to your desk, get back to work, and please don't bring 
up any of this girlfriend stuff ever again, for both of our sakes."</p>
<p>His words washed over her, finally giving her what she needed from him, and suddenly Alani 
found herself with new purpose in life. She obeyed his order automatically, smoothly shutting 
the door on her way out with an uncharacteristically formal "Thank you, Sir."</p>
<p>Alani slowly made her way back to her desk, her mind fully consumed with the question of 
what it meant to be Mr. Davidson's Perfect Secretary. He had told her that she had to become
better organized with regard to her various responsibilities, and since those words were now 
pulsing loudly in the forefront of her brain as well, she figured that was as good a place as any
to start.</p>
<p>She sat down and quickly made a list of all the duties her position entailed. She anticipated 
that this would be a difficult task, given her usual scatterbrained nature, but was surprised to 
find that ideas were flowing out of her head and onto her corporate stationery in a remarkably 
orderly manner, and that her bullet points were perfectly aligned and her sloppy penmanship 
suddenly looked practically calligraphic. In less than ten minutes she had detailed and 
categorized all of her responsibilities, formed action plans for how to improve efficiency and 
accuracy in each task, and even brainstormed new areas where she could potentially be of 
use to Mr. Davidson within the strict confines of her duties as laid out in her contract. Having 
made significant progress in the most immediately relevant aspects of her job, she then 
turned her mind toward all of her other characteristics that could use some improvement on 
her way to becoming Mr. Davidson's Perfect Secretary.</p>
<p>Alani's thoughts briefly drifted back to the strength of her newfound physical attraction for her 
boss, which quickly led her mind to all of the pornographic secretary tropes she had heard 
about, of impossibly busty women in hilariously revealing business attire seducing their 
bosses. She briefly wondered if Mr. Davidson's idea of his Perfect Secretary involved any of 
that, and secretly hoped that it did, but she had no evidence for it so far. Still, she knew that 
men liked big tits, so it made sense that Mr. Davidson would as well, but he hadn't told her to 
become a porn secretary - he'd told her to be the perfect secretary.</p>
<p>Even so, making things around the office as pleasant as possible for her boss was obviously 
an important part of her responsibilities, and that meant she should be pleasant to look at as 
well, though not so much as to distract him from his duties. Satisfied with her conclusion, she 
looked down at her small chest in disappointment, but was surprised and pleased to see her 
tits inexplicably plumping up a bit at the idea. Her blouse pulled tighter around her torso as 
her breasts went from "small and perky" to "pleasantly full and eye-catching", and Alani 
unbuttoned her top button both to relieve the pressure and to proudly show off a hint of her 
new cleavage. There, that was better. And, judging from the slight tightness of her skirt, it 
seemed like her hips and backside might have filled out a bit as well. Now Mr. Davidson 
would be all the more likely to welcome and look forward to her presence in his office, and 
that only meant that she would be able to do her job more easily and efficiently. Alani knew </p>
<p>that she should probably be concerned about being objectified, since it could affect her (and 
more importantly Mr. Davidson's) reputation, but it seemed that his more immediate need for 
an agreeable workspace overruled that concern. She and Mr. Davidson were both 
professionals, after all, and it wasn't like he would want a porn star interfacing with his clients. 
Probably.</p>
<p>As her mind continued to sharpen in order to handle the increased mental load of performing 
at peak efficiency, Alani realized that her sudden interest in improving her figure was likely 
due to her inexplicable infatuation with Mr. Davidson, which she was still feeling the full effects
of despite having been ordered to forget about being his Perfect Girlfriend. Her feelings 
seemed to be a natural physiological response to the energy drink that was clearly and 
irresistibly transforming her into Mr. Davidson's Perfect Secretary, but she figured that as long 
as her crush didn't effect her job performance it was probably fine. It wasn't like she could do 
anything about it in any case. Plus, it felt so good to go slightly weak in the knees with 
adolescent desire whenever she was in his presence, and Alani figured that she was due this 
small amount of pleasure and sexual thrill in exchange for the drastic improvement Mr. 
Davidson would see in her duties.</p>
<p>She let out a longsuffering sigh at the decidedly unprofessional urges the beverage that had 
likely saved her job had also instilled in her, and looked down in helpless amusement and 
conflicted affection at the large tits her moment of unguarded horniness had saddled her with. 
There was always a catch. Now that she had briefly indulged in her new sexual impulses, 
however, it was time to turn her attention to the rest of her appearance with a more critical 
eye. Instinctively, Alani knew that she should look as neat, tidy, and well-organized as her 
work would be from here on out, so she smiled in satisfaction as her nails went from 
carelessly trimmed to perfectly manicured, and she opened her compact to find that not only 
was her makeup now perfectly applied, but her facial features themselves had somehow 
become a bit more elegant as well, befitting her role as the liaison between Mr. Davidson and 
the rest of the business world. Her hair had shifted from a loose ponytail into a neat bun with 
an understated braid along the outside. Alani had no idea how any of of these physical 
changes were happening, of course, but that information was currently irrelevant. All that 
mattered was becoming Mr. Davidson's Perfect Secretary, and she felt a satisfying, visceral 
conviction that she was well on her way to becoming just that.</p>
<p>Lastly, Alani looked down at her blouse and skirt and decided they'd do for today, though she 
also made plans to go shopping after work to pick up a few outfits more appropriate for her 
position. Finally satisfied with her personal progress for the time being, she immersed herself 
in her work and got more done that afternoon than she had the entire previous week.</p>
<p>Jack's eyes briefly dropped to Alani's chest when she went in to see him late that afternoon to
discuss the budget for the upcoming corporate retreat, and she appreciated the instinctive 
pleasure she could tell he was getting from the sight of her pleasantly feminine body. She </p>
<p>tingled uncontrollably with her own desire, of course, being so close to him, but ignored the 
sensation for now. She had work to do.</p>
<p>"Did you do something with your hair?" Jack asked, confused by what seemed to be a 
marked, instantaneous improvement in her appearance. Alani hid a self-satisfied smile, 
knowing full well that his attention hadn't been anywhere near her hair.</p>
<p>"Something like that, Sir. Don't worry about it-"</p>
<p>"You're not trying to seduce me or something again, are you? We talked about this."</p>
<p>"Oh, no, Sir, not at all! Please don't misunderstand. I'm only trying to take my duties more 
seriously like you asked me to, and so I took the time to put a bit more effort into my 
appearance after our last talk. A secretary's professional presence is an undeniably important 
aspect of her duties, and I'm just doing my best to fill my role as perfectly as possible, Sir."</p>
<p>"Ah, well that's good to hear. Very commendable, Alani, keep up the good work!" he said, 
giving her appealing body and plump cleavage one more brief glance before finally noticing 
the folder in her manicured fingers.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Sir. Now, about these figures…"</p>
<p>Alani's marked improvement only accelerated throughout the rest of the week. Where she 
had previously struggled to keep all of her tasks straight, it now seemed to Jack that they had 
somehow become second nature to her. All of Alani's responsibilities were handled 
immediately, efficiently, and with a newfound professionalism that starkly contrasted with the 
bumbling ineptitude of her performance the week before.</p>
<p>Alani was even more aware of her progress than Jack was, of course, but as proud as she 
was of the improvements she had already made, she was always looking for new ways to 
optimize her workflow to please her boss. Whenever she had a bit of downtime in her 
schedule and knew that Jack did too, she'd often feel compelled to come in and ask him for a 
bit more information about his Perfect Secretary.</p>
<p>"Again? You can't be serious," he joked after her second intrusion into his office that day to 
ask how she could better serve him. The truth was, he was looking forward to seeing her 
more and more these days, especially now that the office was running smoother than it ever 
had before after the seemingly overnight transformation of his disorganized secretary into an 
elegant, no-nonsense master of efficiency. Apparently the talk he had had with her had done 
some good, he thought to himself with satisfaction, leaning back in his chair and letting his 
gaze drift over her shapely form.</p>
<p>"I'm serious, Sir. I want to know everything about your dream secretary, the one you know 
you've thought about, but haven't told anyone about," she purred, a bit irritated as the 
physiological effects of the Perfect Girlfriend Juice on her body made her request sound more
suggestive than she had intended.</p>
<p>"Well, I'd say you're pretty much my dream secretary already, Alani," he responded, taking a 
second to indulge his lizard brain once more with a lingering glance up and down her sexy 
figure. He knew she noticed his looks, but she had never commented on them. If anything she
seemed to encourage them, and so he had slowly become more daring in his undisguised 
enjoyment of her body. But, she had also never shown even the slightest interest in wanting 
to come onto him again after that first conversation, and mostly just seemed glad that he was 
enjoying himself, subtly encouraging his gaze, ever the picture of calm, collected 
professionalism.</p>
<p>Jack couldn't remember thinking that Alani was especially attractive before "the talk", as he'd 
started calling it, but now he couldn't deny that she had become positively stunning, a picture 
of elegance and polish, but still with an undeniable sensual femininity that threatened to 
captivate him. She had also gotten much wittier, and had somehow become a brilliant 
conversationalist practically overnight, to the point where talking to this vision of refined 
loveliness became the most natural and enjoyable thing in the world. And so now he found 
himself looking forward to seeing her every day, multiple times a day even, drinking in her 
presence, which still somehow managed to be both invitingly sensuous and coolly platonic. 
Regardless of his earlier rejection of her odd advances, he could see himself easily falling for 
her if he weren't careful, though if he did he'd only have himself to blame, since Alani had only
ever treated him with professional courtesy.</p>
<p>"Are you sure, Sir? There must be something I could be doing better, or some other way I 
could make your job easier for you," Alani responded as she preened inwardly at his praise, 
feeling a bit giddy as he glanced down at her chest once more, though she was careful not to 
let it show. She had gone shopping the day of her first transformation and had made sure to 
select outfits that were perfectly appropriate for her position, but which also advertised the 
inviting swelling of her new breasts and hips. Only so that he would look forward to her 
presence and they could work better as a team, of course. And that seemed to have been the 
right decision, since despite the suggestiveness of her phrasing and the keen interest in his 
eyes as he looked at her body, he took his capable secretary at her word, closed his eyes for 
a second, and thought about whether there was anything else she could do to help the 
business.</p>
<p>"I mostly just wish that everyone else could be as efficient as you are, Alani. Accounts 
Payable are a week behind in shipping out checks, and Accounts Receivable are even worse.
Our cash flow is down, and the inefficiencies are starting to build up. I know it's not at all your 
responsibility, but I wish there were some way you could somehow help out a bit in 
Accounting."</p>
<p>"Well, sir, I can't promise anything," Alani said as she felt a new, unexpected eagerness to 
learn all of the ins and outs of the day-to-day workings of a small company's accounting 
department filling her pliable mind. "But I'll see what I can do," she concluded, giving him a 
playful wink before preparing to leave him to his work. Jack was dazzled by her wink as she 
knew he would be, and she allowed herself to feel just the slightest touch of her own tingly 
infatuation, letting a bit of color rise into her cheeks as she continued to lock eyes with her </p>
<p>manly office crush, before turning and walking to the door. She crossed the room with a 
deliberate pace, knowing that his eyes were on her hips as they exhibited a perfectly 
appropriate amount of sway, wrapped tightly in a professional-yet-suggestive pencil skirt.</p>
<p>Once outside, she paused for a second to remind herself that she wasn't here to seduce him -
she needed only to make herself pleasant to be around. As precise and perfect as this 
meeting with Mr. Davidson had been, she resolved to make it even more so next time, and 
she forced the intense pleasure she had experienced at the slight flirtatiousness of their 
interaction to flow out of her so she could focus back on her own work.</p>
<p>That night, Alani spent her free time at home researching entry-level accounting duties, and 
by the next day she felt ready to step in and aid the clerks. It required a masterfully light touch
to improve efficiency while not stepping on any toes, and it was also somewhat difficult to both
oversee accounting and ensure that she still accomplished her own duties, but somehow she 
managed to get it all done. Two days later, Accounting was fully caught up, cash flow was up, 
and the improved efficiency of the department had made its way back to Jack, who called 
Alani in to his office to congratulate her.</p>
<p>"Alani, you're a miracle worker!" he exclaimed, but she accepted the praise with the calm, 
collected demeanor that had become her default, even as she flushed inwardly with erotic 
heat at the effectiveness of the transformation that had been thrust upon her. "I don't know 
how you did it!"</p>
<p>"It was relatively simple, Sir. I just identified the surprisingly large number of inefficiencies in 
the clerks' processes, which were mostly due to what appears to be deliberate laziness 
bordering on insubordination from practically the entire Accounting staff, and gently 
implemented measures to correct them. It was child's play to get the clerks to think the 
improvements were their own ideas, and once my system was up and running, the problem 
fixed itself."</p>
<p>"That's incredible work, Alani," Jack said, a bit surprised at her harsh characterization of the 
Accounting department's job performance, but filing it away for later nonetheless. He had 
quickly come to place full confidence in Alani's judgment, and if she said their work was 
inexcusable, it must be the case.</p>
<p>"What else can I do for you, Sir?" Alani asked encouragingly, still compelled to continue to 
seek new ways to become even more of a Perfect Secretary even as her additional 
accounting duties already threatened to affect her own work efficiency.</p>
<p>"Oh, nothing," Jack responded, glancing back up so he could greedily drink in her curves 
once more. "You've done more than enough, gone above and beyond. If the guys in shipping 
had a tenth of your new work ethic, our lead times would be the best in the industry."</p>
<p>"I'll see what I can do, sir," Alani said, not sure if she would be able to handle the extra work, 
but knowing that she had no choice if she were to fulfill her role as Mr. Davidson's Perfect 
Secretary.</p>
<p>"What? No, I was only complaining Alani, there's no possible way you could take on any more
responsibility. There's just not enough of you to go around," he concluded with a jocular grin, 
not noticing his subordinate's beautiful eyes widening in shock and her body beginning to 
shake.</p>
<p>"I-if you'll e-excuse me, Sir, there's something I need to go take care of," Alani stammered, 
turning and practically staggering toward the door.</p>
<p>"Alani, are you ok?" Jack asked, rising half out of his chair in concern.</p>
<p>"I-I'm fine, Sir. I just need a moment. I'll be back soon."</p>
<p>"Well let me know if you need any help or anything," he called out as the door closed behind 
his secretary's shapely ass.</p>
<p>Alani's shaking got worse as she stumbled toward her desk. It was so simple, but it couldn't 
be possible, could it? Her body clearly wanted it to be possible, however, and Alani felt her 
quaking come to a final crescendo before an abrupt end, and she felt a serene calm wash 
over her as she was suddenly face-to-face with the attractive facial features and pleasantly 
busty figure of Alani Rhodes.</p>
<p>Both somehow unsurprised at this strange new turn of events, the two Alanis simply smiled at 
each other in complete understanding and got back to work, still fully unified in mind if not in 
body. Mr. Davidson had been exactly right. There wasn't enough of her to go around, and 
there was so much more to be done, still so many ways she could make things better for him. 
A Perfect Secretary's work was neverending, but, thanks to an offhand comment by her boss 
and a dose of Perfect Girlfriend Juice, so was Alani.</p>
