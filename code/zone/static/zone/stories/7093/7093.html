<li><em>Madam Materia</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Valedictorian. It was a heavy title, earned through hard work and
determination; and it was one Karen held when she departed from high
school. Had she deserved it?</p>
<p>She wasn't dumb by any means, her academic achievements were plentiful,
what made her the top was her willingness to dip into "extracurricular"
activities. Shining ruby hair flowed down to the small of her back, a
curtain that highlighted her silhouette from the light flare of her hips
to the perky curve of her modest chest. She was hot, she knew it in how
she carried herself, the choices she made with her fashion, and she knew
when and how to use it.</p>
<p>Some considered such tactics meant she cheated. To the contrary, school
was supposed to teach you to be ready for the world. If she was the only
one smart enough to use every tool at her disposal, then didn't that put
her head and shoulders above the rest? Besides, it wasn't like she
wasn't learning the things she'd need for the future, just bumping the
numbers of more worthless classes along the way; to prove her work ethic
and dedication for her resume.</p>
<p>Disappointingly however, college was proving just the slightest bit more
difficult for the redhead to take advantage of her wiles. Whether
because she was surrounded by proper adults now, where an early puberty
and good genes weren't the same level of edge they were in her teens, or
because her professors were more accustomed to the "sex for grades"
trade, she hadn't yet completely pinned down. Still, she'd managed over
the past two semesters to find the weaknesses she needed to keep her GPA
where she wanted it.</p>
<p>Well, most of them anyway. "Miss Neff," her instructor's voice called
out over the class, disrupting the girl from her train of thought.</p>
<p>Professor Allen Mullins, the aegis immune to her attempts. How, she had
no idea. He was exactly the type who'd normally succumb to her whims,
moderately attractive with a fit form and well-cut brown hair.
Plastic-rimmed glasses sat low on his nose, drawing attention to the
stern gaze of his dark eyes and hinting at the slightest bit of
nerdiness. There wasn't a wedding band on his finger, and she'd pretty
much ruled out him being gay, but still her attempt...</p>
<p>It had been after class a few days back, the redhead emboldened by her
nature and the low-cut v-neck she'd chosen to show off her cleavage,
enhanced by her best push up bra. "Professor Mullins," she cooed, towing
the line being feigned innocence and being obvious about her intentions,
"think I could have a word?"</p>
<p>"Yes Miss Neff?" he was neutral in his delivery, tapping together a
stack of papers against his desk.</p>
<p>She sidled up, resting her elbows down and using them as a frame for her
assets as she laid them over her arms. "I was wondering if, maybe, we
could talk about my grade?" her teeth raked her bottom lip, pushing it
out and making its ruby paint shine.</p>
<p>His dark eyes turned to her, magnified by his glasses. "What about it
Karen?" he asked, briefly flicking his gaze up to her hair, avoiding her
chest entirely.</p>
<p>The girl could read the signs, tell what a man was into and play to it.
She reached up to fan her ruby mane, bringing it over her shoulder to
display its shine and once more point down to her bust. "I was thinking,
there has to be some... extra credit I could do, right? Bump up my
numbers a bit," she rolled her shoulders, her forearms pulling her
already risky top down another inch so the edge of her bra was peeking
up over the neckline.</p>
<p>"Well," the professor adjusted his glasses, bringing a small smirk to
her face, "you could start with a proper interest in philosophy Miss
Neff."</p>
<p>The curl to her lip faded, her sense she'd gotten her way going with it.
Time to double down. "You do a pretty good job on interesting me
professor," she cast her sparkling greens on him, undressing him with
her eyes, letting subtleties in her expression speak for her "interest".</p>
<p>Once more the man looked her over. "That's good," he said, once again
tapping his papers to the desk before getting to his feet, "I'm glad
that I can pique your interest in the subject. Mayhap if you put the
same effort you do dressing into your assignments, you wouldn't be
failing," and with that, he left her there on long steps without so much
as a second thought.</p>
<p>It was still stinging her to this day. "Miss Neff, if you paid attention
and took notes, perhaps you'd be closer to that grade you want?" he
suggested, locking her back in the present as he openly called her out
in front of the whole lecture hall.</p>
<p>The silent shame of her classmates was worse than the sort of giggling
high schoolers would have given, leaving Karen blushing nearly red as
her hair and hiding behind her textbook. Who was he to criticize her?
Philosophy, nothing here was going to be useful for her career plan.
This was just a filler course on the way to her future as a software
engineer.</p>
<p>She used the sound of the bell to hide a groan, the rest of her
classmates filtering out around her and leaving her the only student in
the lecture hall, as Professor Mullins made his way up to her seat. "You
know, Epicurus once said: 'The greater the difficulty, the more glory in
surmounting it'. I have no issue helping you with my class Miss Neff, I
could even recommend you a few readings that would certainly offer
insight into the subject."</p>
<p>"Bite me," the redhead wasn't in the mood for a lecture.</p>
<p>With a laugh Allen shook his head, the loose bits of his woody hair
swaying across his forehead. "That wouldn't be appropriate," he said as
he laid a small stack of sheets upon her desk. "Here, copies of the
slides and quotes from today, since you didn't seem keen on opening your
notebook," he stepped away calmly, suitcase in hand, towards the door to
head for his break. But not before giving her one last bit of advice.
"'Morality is not the doctrine of how we make ourselves happy, but how
we may make ourselves worthy of happiness\'."</p>
<p>She turned towards him, an incredulous look in her eye at his unsubtle
call out. "More Epicurus?" she tried to sass.</p>
<p>"No, Immanuel Kant. You'd know that if you read your textbook," the man
chastised with a small adjustment of his glasses before departing.</p>
<p>Karen kept on a smile as long as she could, to be certain he was gone,
then took up her book bag and smothered her face in it to scream. "Who
does he think he is?" she furiously muttered, stamping her hard-soled
shoes on the linoleum to vent her frustration.</p>
<p>Her eyes turned to the stack, slapping it away and all across the
lecture hall; something she immediately regretted. Littering in the
halls was frowned upon, she'd have to clean up before she left, lest she
score herself a suspension that would impact her other classes.</p>
<p>With a sigh to calm herself, the curvy girl got to her feet, starting to
collect the print outs one at a time until she happened upon a curious
one: "I can control my passions and emotions if I can understand their
nature" -- Spinoza</p>
<p>Perhaps there <em>was</em> something to be learned from philosophy?</p>
<p>So what if he'd resisted her charms immediately? Every man had a
weakness, it was only a matter of figuring it out; understanding the
nature of Professor Mullins\' passions. And what was it that he'd said:
"The greater the difficulty, the more glory in surmounting it"?</p>
<p>Oh, she would surmount it. Find his Achilles heel and turn him to putty
in her fingers. All she had to do was find it.</p>
<p>It would take a couple days yet. Karen had to ensure she was ahead
enough in her important courses, and that her less relevant professors
were placated, to allow herself a lull to execute the first stage of her
plan. It wasn't too hard, a request to do some assignments early here, a
handy there, and she had herself a proper safety net to take a day off.
One she was putting to good use.</p>
<p>She arrived on campus early, pulling her car into a nice secluded corner
of the parking lot with a good view. A bit of pre-emptive sleuthing with
one of her other marks let her know which spot was Allen's, so all the
redhead had to do was wait.</p>
<p>The exact details of her plan weren't entirely set in stone. If she
could get her hands on a laptop or internet search data, that would be
the best method; she even programmed herself a worm that could do the
job. The opportunity to slip it into a USB port, out of the sight of
campus security, while also being able to get her thumb drive back, was
the big hiccup. If she fumbled at any step, she could be risking far
more than a low grade or a suspension.</p>
<p>So, finding her window would take delicate care. The curvy redhead
needed to figure out some semblance of her professor's schedule,
starting with his arrival; which she caught right on cue. A beat-up
looking car slipped into the empty slot her sparkling verdant eyes had
been watching like a bird of prey, and as she'd been promised Professor
Mullins stepped out with a full book bag and his briefcase.</p>
<p>Now was the tricky part. Karen was one to stand out, she enjoyed it, but
she couldn't let her mark know she was following him. She managed to get
her aunt's help, the woman was one hell of a looker, with tits enough it
left her sweaters a pinch oversized; sweaters that on her niece were
baggy enough to be inconspicuous. A tight bun for her ruby locks with a
simple cap and she felt...</p>
<p>Schlumpy. It was enough of a contrast from her usual self though she was
sure it would help her blend in. With the pen she kept in the rings of
her notebook she scribbled the time in the back pages, <em>"Arrives: \~8:30
AM"</em>, and locked her vehicle to start her pursuit.</p>
<p>The man juggled his belongings, setting his briefcase on the back of his
car so he could adjust his glasses before collecting everything and
starting inside. The redhead kept close behind him, doing her best to
fade into with any small groups of students going the same direction,
and praying not to be noticed by anyone she knew. His first step was
obvious, she recognized the halls well enough, he was headed towards the
faculty lounge; somewhere she was unable to follow.</p>
<p>Already the curvy stalker could tell he was suspicious, those stern eyes
flicking her way as he started opening the door. Fortunately, luck was
on her side, and there was a small flock of girls chatting she could
hide behind.</p>
<p>Their lead wasn't too dissimilar to her, a fiery redhead, attractive.
She probably had a good head on the to-be software engineer's five-foot
four frame though, and such extra size wasn't limited to just a vertical
advantage. The girl was wearing a stretchy turtleneck, for good reason
as the front was pulled tight around a pair of lush, if Karen had to
guess, double Ds; more than enough to leave the smaller girl jealous.</p>
<p>"Girls," Professor Mullins dipped his head, his loose bangs casting a
shadow over his face.</p>
<p>They gave him a small wave as they passed, their stowaway keeping her
books to her chest, but stealing a peek at him on the way. Were his
cheeks flush? It was hard to tell between the shade and her company, but
she would swear his face was pink, and those thin lips were twisted in a
nervous smile.</p>
<p>He finally stepped into the lounge, letting her stop her pursuit and
take a few more notes. <em>"First stop, faculty lounge, \~8:35 AM. Likes
tall girls?"</em> the other possibility was bustier girls, leaving her hand
trembling, ready to write it and scratch it out in frustration. So, she
wasn't good enough?</p>
<p>She pulled open the collar of her oversized top, staring down at her
proud and perky bosom. Who was he not to appreciate what she had? It was
plenty! Plus, she had a way better face than that bitch. Hell, she was
probably stuffing or something to keep people's attention down that way.</p>
<p>It was all just a hunch, but it was still enough to have her blood
boiling. "Focus," she told herself, slapping her notebook closed. She
needed to find her opportunity.</p>
<p>Peeking in through the small window in the door she watched the
professor unpacking his laptop onto the table before heading to the
little kitchenette for a cup of coffee. In her head, Karen was counting
the seconds. She couldn't get at his computer in the staff room,
obviously, but his relaxed behaviour could be a weak point to exploit.
If it was regular.</p>
<p>He stayed at the pot, waiting for the end of the drip before getting
himself a mug and pouring his first for the morning. Two cream, a sugar,
useless details but it added to the time she'd have if this was her only
break. She marked the end when he turned, taking a sip and making his
way back to look over his lessons for the day.</p>
<p>About twenty-seven seconds. Plenty, if his PC was fast enough to read
her thumb drive, but she had to potentially consider driver
installation, not to mention she knew there were cameras in the hall;
the little bubbles on the ceiling set to record and ensure there was
evidence if a student was suspected of nabbing test answers.</p>
<p>No good, she reasoned, jotting down her observations in the margins,
<em>"Lax with device, at least in faculty areas."</em></p>
<p>There was some time yet until classes began, and she was playing a risky
game. Spying on the teacher's lounge was asking him to look and see her,
and on camera she needed to move in case she aroused suspicion. His
first lecture wasn't until nine, so she deemed it safest to make at
least one loop around the hall before a second check.</p>
<p>She took her time, plotting out her excuse in case she was questioned.
Coming around the bend she re-approached the door, trying to keep it
subtle, her green eyes peeking over from under her cap and through that
little window; a mistake.</p>
<p>Allen was already on his feet, briefcase in his hand and his laptop
tucked under his arm. <em>"Crap!"</em> was her only thought, in a panic that
had her scrambling for what to do.</p>
<p>It was only a split second, but in her head, it felt like a minute. She
was the only one in the hall right now, most students would be hovering
around their classrooms, leaving her with two options: keep going
forward, or quickly turn around. She didn't know which way her professor
would be going either.</p>
<p>If she kept on her path, and he followed behind, she'd be right in his
sights, leaving her caught in the headlights with little chance for
recovery. If he went the opposite way, regardless of her choice, she had
to hit the end of the hall to make her U-turn, which risked losing him.
It was lose-lose, she was going to have to improvise either way.</p>
<p>Forward was the shorter distance; the curvy girl pressed on. Her pace
quickened and she heard the door open behind her, Professor Mullins\'
dress shoes slapping on the tile as he entered the hall with her. She
honed her ears on that sound, unable to reasonably turn around to watch
him. It paused and she wished she could see what was going on. Was he
looking at her, suspicious? He'd seen her with those other girls after
all.</p>
<p>The moment passed however, and soon enough those shoes were coming in
steady; he was going the same direction.</p>
<p>Her worst-case scenario. Karen needed a way to fall behind him again,
and immediately set to wracking her brain. A small part of her cursed a
lack of foresight, she could have asked her professor directly for his
schedule, where she could find him if she needed any help. Then again,
considering she'd revealed her hand early as seduction that probably
would have just come off fishing for more opportunities to get him
alone.</p>
<p>An idea, she only hoped he wasn't too close to see through it. Her steps
slowed, and she fished into her packet for her phone, opening it up and
flicking into the first app she could think of to make it look like
she'd gotten a message.</p>
<p>Sweat was on her brow, her heart hammering nervously as the sound on the
man's footsteps grew closer. She dared to let her eyes wander, beneath
the veil of her cap, to watch his crisp, pale blue, dress shirt walk by
her. His gaze was forward, not on her, and soon enough he continued
onwards to his destination.</p>
<p>A sigh of relief escaped under her breath, and she marked the time from
her phone for her notes. <em>"\~8:46 AM departs for first lecture,"</em> she
scribbled down quickly and resumed her pursuit.</p>
<p>The disguised redhead was able to slip into the crowd once more as they
got into the larger common area. Gaggles of students sitting at the
various couches were her screen, as they waited for the first class to
begin. Professor Mullins was greeted warmly, the man giving a nod and
setting his case down rather than awkwardly unlock the hall. Not
everyone was here for him, letting his stalker relax in one of the plush
seats and watch from afar once more. Nice and safe.</p>
<p><em>"First class: 9:00 AM."</em> It wasn't too much of a surprise. Still, it
meant at least a couple hours of Karen just bumming around this area of
the college campus.</p>
<p>Reclining on the little sofa, the soft cushions cradling and reminding
her of her well-hidden form, she plotted her next move with taps of the
back of her pen against the page. The only thing she cared about was if
there was any lull in this class, but even then, if she snuck in, there
would be at least thirty pairs of potential eyes that could see her. No
good. All she could do was monitor which exit the professor opted for at
the lunch bell and continue her pursuit.</p>
<p>For as boring as she found philosophy lectures, just waiting outside for
one to end was worse. She didn't even have anything to work on, her
whole plan having relied on getting far enough ahead to have the day
free to find her opening. What was it they say about hindsight?</p>
<p>As the minutes crept forward, she could feel her eyelids growing droopy,
fluttering on the cusp of consciousness. Karen knew she couldn't fall
asleep, she needed to keep her mind active. She ran through her social
media, got up for a stretch, briefly checked on the class in case she
might stumble across something she could use.</p>
<p>Eventually she settled on reviewing her notes, lingering on that memory
from earlier. <em>"Likes tall girls."</em> Begrudgingly she added <em>"Bustier?"</em>
to it. Whether she liked it or not, she couldn't overlook that
possibility. That was the point of her virus after all, to find his
weaknesses. If she could observe more data to support it, she may not
need to use her worm.</p>
<p>Maybe she could get her aunt to help her out a bit more? She was single
at the moment, not that the woman ever had trouble getting what she
wanted.</p>
<p>A potential path, which the ruby-haired girl scribbled down in her
margin.</p>
<p>After a long wait, and more idle observation through the small window,
the bell rang loud. Time to get back to work. Pulling her cap down the
curvy stalker waited by the door, watching the crowd of students pour
out into the open area. Mullins stayed to pack up his briefcase,
slipping his laptop into a Velcro section of the lid, and started up the
pitch towards the second floor.</p>
<p>Good and bad. It would be easier to blend in, not being right outside
the door, but she had to beat him up there. Rushing on her flats she got
to the stairwell, squeezing her way between others going up and down
towards their own goals, until she popped out on the second floor. Just
in time, as she caught the professor's loosely kept hair headed down the
hall. Towards the cafeteria, the girl noted, easily able to blend in
with the flow of bodies headed that way.</p>
<p>From the tight halls to an open space once more, she had to keep her
eyes trained on her mark. He moved with purpose, making his way directly
to one of the little fast-food booths to get himself a sub sandwich; and
Karen had a pretty good idea why.</p>
<p>The girl working the till had a cheery little smile on her
burgundy-coloured lips, strawberry blonde hair tucked into a hair net.
She stood only a couple inches shorter than the six-foot teacher, still
quite tall for a woman, with a bit of a larger frame to match. Her most
prominent feature however were her breasts, the white uniform she wore
stretched out to the sides further than her green apron could cover.</p>
<p>His stalker settled at a table with a good view, opening her notebook
and readying her pen as she watched.</p>
<p>Professor Mullins got to the front, and she saw it again, that pink tint
in his cheeks visible even from this distance. She watched his eyes,
starting at the counter, then slowly rising to linger on that
overstuffed bust, before he broke away and got up to the service girl's
face. "The usual Germaine," his voice wavered as he spoke.</p>
<p>You couldn't be more obvious. That same envious jealousy bubbled up
within Karen, and she scribbled down the confirmation, <em>"Definitely a
tits guy."</em></p>
<p>Karen watched carefully, expecting him to return to the teacher's
lounge; it was customary after all. To her surprise, the professor made
his way to one of the cafeteria tables, close to the sub shop of course,
and pulled out his laptop.</p>
<p>The redhead perked, immediately setting to jotting this vulnerability
down. <em>"\~12:10 PM works in the cafeteria."</em></p>
<p>As she finished writing the sentence however, it occurred to her to add
one last part, catching the way his eyes would casually drift behind his
glasses, <em>"to ogle the cashier."</em></p>
<p>Once more she checked her chest, stewing in negative thoughts of her own
perceived inadequacy. This was the best opportunity for her to deploy
her virus, but in reality, she'd already found the chip in his armor. It
just wasn't her.</p>
<p>It didn't matter. With what she'd observed so far, he'd buckle to her
aunt like wheat in the wind. Still, she had pride in herself, her body,
and today was dealing it some heavy hits.</p>
<p>There wasn't much more to gain following him. She had what she needed,
the only thing to do was definitively confirm her findings, like any
good programmer, and put together her plan of attack. For the former,
they were in one of the most crowded parts of the school. It was as easy
as people watching, and subtly sending girls with the right traits his
way.</p>
<p>Tall, busty, and considering the commonalities the girls that flustered
him seemed to have, she dared to jot down red-headed. At least she was
one out of three. She stayed to observe her findings for the whole of
the lunch hour, occasionally convincing women with any one of the
desired traits his way. There was definitely a hierarchy, tits would get
the longest looks on their own, taller girls next, though they needed at
least chest comparable to Karen's to get his attention, and finally if
they were a redhead, it would add a little extra tint to his cheeks; she
recognized a fetish when she saw it.</p>
<p>Yes, her aunt would do fine. What she lacked in the second department
she more than made up for in the first, it was just going to be a matter
of convincing her. And finally netting herself that "A" she deserved.</p>
<p>"Aunt Donna?" Karen called as she stepped into her aunt's home.</p>
<p>A quick text to her buxom relative to announce she was coming, tell her
she had a little "problem" she needed help with, and the girl had set
off with the lunch bell; she still had the rest of the day off, and saw
no reason not to start putting things into motion. Her aunt had seemed
receptive, despite not knowing the exact details. <em>"I'll make sure to be
ready for you Karrie,"</em> had been her reply.</p>
<p>However, the redheaded girl received no answer to her arrival. The door
had been unlocked, but her aunt was nowhere to be seen. There was no
sound of running water, nor the gentle sizzle of food on the stove that
would indicate where the woman might be; just silence.</p>
<p>"Aunt Donna?" the curvy girl called once more, and again, got nothing.</p>
<p>Maybe she'd arrived early? Either way, she had privacy, and the
oversized sweater she'd worn for the day's covert activities was
starting to get stuffy. Built for her aunt's massive chest and not her
own, it came off her body easily, revealing the thin sheen of sweat it
had helped her work up over the day. It gave her lithe form a natural
glow, one many a man had drooled over, and yet even in her cute little
push up bra, today had left her feeling bitter about it.</p>
<p>There was nothing she could do, and that made it all the more
aggravating. With an annoyed huff she threw the top at one of her aunt's
chairs with enough force to leave it wobbling on its legs, and set about
letting her hair down from its bun.</p>
<p>What did he know anyway? She was-</p>
<p>As Karen moved out into her aunt's living room, she caught sight of the
dining room; where atop the woman's polished table sat an old book,
along with what looked to be a hand-written letter. Curiosity was never
something she was light on, and thus the scantily clad cutie made her
way over to investigate.</p>
<p><em>"Dear Karrie,"</em> the letter began.</p>
<p><em>"It's your auntie Donna, of course. Sorry I couldn't be there for you,
but life calls as it usually does, at the least opportune times.</em></p>
<p><em>When you came for my sweater yesterday, I had a pretty good idea what
you were really after from that itchy tone in your voice. Your mother
informed me about your 'extracurriculars'. I remember when I was about
your age, I was the same way, and also remember the first time I hit a
brick wall. It's frustrating, I know, but there's a way over every
boundary that will get in your way.</em></p>
<p><em>This book, my grandmother gave it to me when I hit my snag, and I never
looked back. I wish I could be there to guide you like she did me, but
like I said, life calls. You're a smart girl, smarter than me for sure,
so I know you'll be able to figure it out.</em></p>
<p><em>Auntie Donna."</em></p>
<p>An old book? How was that supposed to help?</p>
<p>Setting the letter aside she took up the tome, lightly brushing the thin
veneer of dust from its surface. It definitely looked like something
from her great grandmother's time. It was properly leather bound, faded
around the edges, and without any sort of title; simply some embroidery.
A journal maybe?</p>
<p>Despite her skepticism, her curiosity was greater. She pulled the heavy
cover open, immediately beset by strange symbols and hand-written notes
so old the ink had begun to fade and stain the page. Clearly the book
had seen many hands over the years, her aunt's delicate, looping scripts
only the most recent, offering advice and translations.</p>
<p>Whatever original language it was Karen didn't recognize it, but through
the notes of those that owned it before, she was able to parse it as
some sort of instruction manual. For what though?</p>
<p>Delicately turning the pages, she came across one that had her aunt's
writing all over it, with one line in particular catching the redhead's
inquisitive spark. "Better boobs?"</p>
<p>No way, it was impossible. Granted aunt Donna had a chest beyond anyone
else in the family, by leaps and bounds, it was a medical condition
though, right? The more she thought about it however, the more the curvy
girl couldn't recall her aunt ever saying anything of the sort, her mom
either. But some random recipe in a book, really?</p>
<p>It was stupid, but at the same time, what did she have to lose? She had
to wait for the buxom woman to return home anyway, why not waste some
time on a dumb, fake "spell"?</p>
<p>Looking it over, it didn't seem too hard either, just a matter of
pronouncing these old words properly, and all the work there had been
done for her. Guiding her finger along the phonetic line her aunt had
written, she sounded it out. It felt childish, little more than
gibberish as it escaped her lips as a series of drawled vowels and sharp
consonants, and she wondered if maybe her relative was sitting just
around the corner ready to pop out with a "gotcha" and lecture her on
her habits. Soon though, those thoughts were laid to rest.</p>
<p>A tingle came over her, causing her to lean back in her seat. It was
nearly impossible for Karen to articulate, it wasn't bad per say, but it
was definitely something she'd never experienced before; somewhere
between the feeling of having her whole body fall asleep and basking in
the sun.</p>
<p>She took a breath in, and it held a strange taste on her tongue; cold
like mint, and tingly like sour sugar. The sensation moved through her
body, down her throat to her lungs where it seemed to swell inside her
chest. With each quickened gasp it intensified, growing inside of her
until it reached its apex, and her leafy eyes went wide.</p>
<p>Her breasts. In nothing but her bra, every little change was obvious.
She could feel her nipples, hard like diamonds and brushing against the
soft padding of her little push-up as they thickened. The round masses
were pushing up, each heartbeat pushing that feeling within her chest
into them, making her skin tickle and stretch to accommodate their
expanding size. In just a few seconds they were overflowing her poor
undergarment, billowing out above and below, and leaving her straps
digging into her shoulders.</p>
<p>The high slowly wore off, the sensations fading and leaving the redhead
feeling normal again. Well, as normal as having just watched your tits
grow before your eyes could be. She reached up instinctively, cupping
them, making sure they were real and not just her imagination. The
doughy flesh squished between her fingers, and she could feel her
sensitive teats pushing into her palms as they tented even the rigid
fabric of her shaping bra. Definitely real, just toying with them
sending a delightful euphoria through her.</p>
<p>It actually worked! Her aunt was some kind of witch, or something, with
a book that gave her massive, reality defying, boobs. And now it was in
Karen's hands.</p>
<p>Should she do it again? She had to at least be on par with that tall
girl from the hall now, a little more and she might even be able to be
biggest on campus if she wanted.</p>
<p>Then again, such endowments would likely get in her way in the long run;
she'd seen all too well the havoc her aunt's chest could cause in tight
spaces. Plus, it was only one part of the Mullins equation. If this
thing could make her bustier, what else could it do? Could it make her
taller? Smarter perhaps?</p>
<p>The next hour was spent diving deep into the mysteries of the text,
pouring over the other spells, the translations from over the years by
its past owners. It was remarkable really, an ancient language that, if
the notes were any indication, made its words into reality. Something
that with a smirk the now busty girl couldn't help but equate to her
passion: programming.</p>
<p>In theory, with the research here, all she had to do was put the right
syllables together, and she could craft a spell to do anything she'd
need. And with that knowledge, why just boost her bust and tweak her
height, when she could make herself, if these translations were
accurate, "Whatever I want."</p>
<p>Fetching her notebook, she opened a fresh page, eagerly clicking her pen
and getting to work. Not every spell had her aunt's notes, or even what
she assumed to be her great grandmother's, but there was enough to
fairly accurately make out most of them, and break them down to their
base components. Karen scrawled down her first few symbols, along with
their phonetics and their meaning.</p>
<p>The book, overall, seemed to focus heavily on the self, the betterment
of the caster whether through physical change, or by charming others,
gifts of wealth and the like. It was rudimentary, all the more
comparable to basic programming language, but before too long she had
the beginnings of her spell.</p>
<p>"Make caster," that was easy enough to simply copy from her aunt's
breast spell, once she found the pattern in other modification spells.</p>
<p>She had to be careful with the rest of her words however. It was
dangerous to try and reliably lean on the older translations; some words
had many meanings in English, and which one an ancient owner of the book
may have meant were a guess at best. After a good while of cross
referencing, she figured she had it though. Three more symbols that
seemed to mean something between "the object of desire", and "what they
desire".</p>
<p>The notes on those words generally involved having a clear image in your
head of what you wanted. So, if her hypothesis was correct, she just had
to picture the body she wanted in her mind, speak the words, and it
would be hers. She could even keep it for later to deal with problems
like this down the line, it was the ultimate multi-function spell!</p>
<p>With a grin on her lips, it was time for her to test it. Karen took a
moment to close her eyes, picturing herself in her mind's eye. She
replayed the day's events, walking with the girls in the hall, this
time, standing tall enough her nose was above the tall one's head. In
the cafeteria she could walk up to the counter, resting tits larger than
her head down in front of the cashier just to dwarf the poor girl. Then
she dipped back further, to her failed seduction attempt on the
philosophy professor, lording over him and hanging those same amazing
tits in front of his face, watching him squirm.</p>
<p>Yes, a few more minor touch-ups and she had it. The emerald in her eyes
sparkled, and she looked down past her already improved cleavage to her
notes, reading them aloud.</p>
<p>That tingling sensation returned, spreading over the whole of her body.
The sharp intake of excited breath she took in tasted of sour and mint,
beginning to fill up in her very core. It was working, she was changing!</p>
<p>It was slower than with her breasts, then again, she was asking a lot
more. The redhead felt it first in her toes and fingertips. Her arms
were getting long, ready to fit on a form more than a foot taller. She
felt her shoes getting snug, the stitching between the cheap parts of
her sneakers audibly straining. The hems of her pant legs started rising
up her ankles, the rough fabric of her jeans rubbing against her calves
as they subtly thickened, and pushed her line of sight higher.</p>
<p>With all the sensations, just standing up in her excitement was
vertigo-inducing. The growing girl stumbled with a small wave of
dizziness, and just that little movement of her body had her clothes
crying out in protest. Her bra strap was growing tighter, creaking as it
struggled with the renewed swelling of her bust, along with the
two-pronged attack coming from her widening torso. A shame she probably
wouldn't be in the thirties band range, but with the jaws she was going
to drop, it was well worth it.</p>
<p>One of her hands jumped to the table to catch her balance, the legs
scraping on the floor from the sudden impact of her multiplying weight.
In the motion, her ruby hair poured over her shoulders, her already
eye-catching locks having gained a surreal luster. Caressing her skin,
it had the feeling of fine silk, cascading down her body to fall around
her thighs in a lustrous mane.</p>
<p>There was a restrictive tightness building in her jeans, the seams along
the sides beginning to strain, growing into tiny diamond shaped holds
that cried out in protest at each small shift in her position. As
another breath came in, hitting her with a wave of growth, her thighs
extended and filled the room with the popping of threads.</p>
<p>She had to look down, had to see them, so thick and juicy she couldn't
get her hands around them. They were needed of course, to support the
luscious ass that was growing in her bottoms. She could feel her thong
already pulling up between the hot lips of her sex, rubbing against her
clit as each little squirm had her inflating butt digging them deeper.
The girl had never imagined something like this was possible, let alone
that it would feel so good. When the back of her pants finally burst,
letting the cleavage of her cheeks squeeze out and take off some of the
pressure, she couldn't help but moan at the feeling of those underthings
wedging themselves deeper.</p>
<p>This was just a teaser though. Couldn't have everything down below after
all, hourglasses need a good base to balance amazing tops, and Karen's
was going to have extra.</p>
<p>Already she could feel the climax coming, the grand finale of her
transformation. Her core extended, leaving her skin feeling tight, her
spine stiff, as she started towering over her old self. Like a blossom
in bloom, it then pressed out into her breasts. Her nipples peeked up
over the edge of her ill-equipped undergarment, the rosy buds fattening
in anticipation of what was to come.</p>
<p>The now Amazonian redhead wasn't about to miss it either, not when she
knew what was coming. On shaky feet she tried to straighten, combatting
the vertigo just so she could take her tits in her grasp. Her teats were
tender, their caps as big round as her pinky, and she could feel her
flesh starting to multiply under her touch. A breath in, and she could
feel them filling up, squeezing between her fingers where they could and
applying more strain on her bra.</p>
<p>Her straps were already digging into her shoulders, so it was no
surprise when with a groan they burst, whipping up and around to fall
slack over her expanding bust. The band was screaming, the topmost
connector snapping in its vain attempt to contain breasts that defied
containment. They were spilling over the hem, muffining out beneath the
underwire, putting the very stitching to the test to see which part of
the supportive garment would give first.</p>
<p>Turned out to be the hooks. With a resounding tear the metal loops were
ripped from the fabric, the unbound band exploding off its owner's body.
Without any further restraint Karen's chest jumped forward, nearly
bowling her over at the surge of flesh overflowing her hands. She
stumbled, but couldn't keep the grin on her face as she caught herself
and looked down.</p>
<p>The magical sensations began to dissipate, their spell complete, leaving
the divine creature to bask in her new beauty. Even hanging freely her
head-sized boobs created a natural cleavage. There wasn't a girl at the
college that could make her feel second best, she was massive, and with
just another few "words" and an image in her head, she could go even
further.</p>
<p>Straightening herself proved to be a challenge. Her body ached a dozen
different ways, and she heard her joints popping, demanding her to
stretch and work out the kinks. The remnants of her jeans stressed, a
few last errant strands bursting as they tried to stay on her voluptuous
form, and her fingers were effortlessly brushing the ceiling.</p>
<p>"Probably should have seen if I could make my clothes grow," she mused,
closing the spell book and catching another note from her aunt beneath.</p>
<p><em>"You'll probably need some new clothes; take anything you need from my
bedroom Karrie."</em></p>
<p>The redhead couldn't help a chuckle. Yeah, she'd need some of those;
probably not so oversized anymore, but they'd do until she could get to
the mall for some properly fitting, and revealing, attire. Yes, Allen
was going to crumble beneath her charms when he saw her tomorrow.</p>
<p>The shrill ring of the bell signaled the beginning of another class,
Professor Mullins already right where he needed to be. Despite her
absence from class the prior day, the man had obviously noticed the less
than conspicuous redhead tailing him for the majority of the day. Was
Miss Neff so desperate as to try and steal test answers? He certainly
hoped not. She was a brilliant girl, and seeing her expelled for doing
something stupid was a waste of her potential.</p>
<p>Despite her distaste for his subject, he knew her to at least be
punctual. So, as the second bell sounded and she wasn't there in her
usual seat, he couldn't help a small spark of concern. "Alright class,"
he started, flicking the projector on to get things started, "if
you'll-"</p>
<p>The sound of the door interrupted, drawing the educator and his class'
attention to whoever it was entering late. A hushed whisper fell over
them, the professor's dark eyes, unable to keep composure, went wide
behind his spectacles. Through the portal ducked a goddess of a woman,
an Amazon of old, towering near seven feet high in her loud heels. Legs
that seemed a mile long were hugged by near-sheer tights, a loose skirt
flowed about her thighs, just around the acceptable level, teasing the
firm roundness of her ass. Her waist cinched in sinfully, shown off by
the real show, a perfect pair of heavy tits so big her, by comparison
tiny, textbooks had to be held beneath, pushing them further upward to
display the foot's worth of cleavage revealed by her low v-neck.</p>
<p>"I-I think you may have the wrong class Miss," Allen tried to at least
stay professional, adjusting his glasses to try and hide the redness
starting to seep into his face.</p>
<p>The beauty just smirked, taking a moment to flair her gorgeous ruby
hair, letting it cascade through her fingers and over her magnificent
form. "No, this is the right one," she purred, fishing through the books
pulled to her core and showing off her Philosophy 101 textbook. "What's
wrong Professor Mullins, I miss one day and you don't recognize me?"</p>
<p>"Karen?" a number of her classmates\' voices broke the weighty silence,
fueling the redhead's ego all the more.</p>
<p>Her mark's speechlessness however was perfect. "Miss Neff? M-my
apologies," he finally managed, clearly struggling to maintain himself.
She could see it from here, the tent in his slacks he turned to his desk
to hide. "Well, if you'd take your seat, you're holding up the rest of
your classmates."</p>
<p>The waver in his voice was precious. The enormous woman didn't even
bother with a reply, letting the clicks of her high heels be the only
sound in the room as she ascended the stands to her desk.</p>
<p>It was quite the effort just to sit. These little pullover seats were
made to handle plus sized individuals, but never had their makers
considered someone of Karen's new extreme proportions. Though not fat,
she was heavy, and the chair groaned from her massive body settling into
it. Worse was her legs. Muscle memory had her knees banging the
underside of her little pull out, making her books jump and bang,
keeping the room's attention on her; right where she liked it, but not
for the reasons she wanted.</p>
<p>She needed to stretch out, her strappy footwear poking over the edge and
nearly kicking the student in front of her were it not for her own
delicate care. Behind her she could hear the annoyed grunts of the
classmate her new high head was blocking. They didn't seem keen on her
new form, but they weren't who mattered.</p>
<p>Karen's verdant greens were gazing up the lecture hall, watching the
source of her weeks-long ire with a smirk upon her full lips. She had
him squirming, she could see it in the tremble of his hands while he
explained his slides, the way his attention would dart her way and he'd
skip a beat of his lecture as his tongue tied. He was finally playing
her game, and thus she was rewarding him: A little uncrossing of her
legs to let him see her underwear; a finger toying with her hair, else
her neckline to air out the extreme cleavage she now sported; slowly
running her tongue over the scarlet paint on her lips; or leaning
forward and pressing her tits through the window of her arms, to have
them billow out and appear even bigger. There wasn't a need for subtly
anymore, she was all he craved, it was just a matter of teasing him to
set the expectation.</p>
<p>The end of class couldn't come soon enough. Even in her usual boredom,
the pre-lunch lecture always droned on. Today, it was anticipation
reaching its breaking point. She'd never really cared about her targets.
Sex was sex; fun, but a tool like any other. This time however, there
was a thirst for the satisfaction of finally surmounting this obstacle,
and earning her top grade.</p>
<p>When the bell sounded the beauty could feel her heart hammering, she
plush rear staying firmly in its seat while she waited for her
classmates to file out. Unsurprisingly, many opted to come up from the
front rows, stealing glances at the buxom Amazon as they passed.
Flattering, but they weren't her focus. She was transfixed by her prey
up at his desk, hurriedly rushing to get his things away before she
descended upon him.</p>
<p>That just wouldn't do. She drew up her books, if only for the illusion
she needed his help as she walked against the crowd, head and shoulders
above them, unable to be ignored. Each step down left her heavy chest
bouncing on its confines, threatening to spill out or bowl over any soul
unfortunate enough to get in her way.</p>
<p>"Professor Mullins," she hailed to ensnare him in her trap.</p>
<p>She was close enough to catch him sweating, combatting his baser urges
to keep his eyes up towards hers. "Yes Miss Neff?"</p>
<p>Laying down her props Karen repeated her first attempt, resting on her
elbows and letting her bust pour over her arms. This time however, they
overflowed, spilling so far out her textbook disappeared beneath their
soft mass. "I was wondering if maybe we could talk about my grade
again?"</p>
<p>The man swallowed thickly, running his fingers through his brown bangs
to clear his forehead. "What about it?" he repeated his reply from her
first attempt, still idly packing his notes and laptop.</p>
<p>A grin spread across her painted lips as she leaned forward, her breasts
billowing through her arms, peeking over the neckline of her top. "I
think you know," she teased, "You're a bright man Allen, and what did
you tell me the other day? It's not about how we make ourselves happy,
but how we <em>make</em> ourselves worthy of it," she recited.</p>
<p>"Kant, on morality," he wasn't really of the mind to correct the
statement, his dark eyes unable to keep from drinking in the girl's new
body. "How?" he couldn't help asking, unable to conceive how such a
growth spurt could happen almost overnight.</p>
<p>The Amazonian beauty brushed a strand of her long, ruby hair over her
shoulder, letting it cascade over the curve of her slender neck and drag
through her deep cleavage. "The greater the difficulty," she taunted.</p>
<p>"I decided to follow the advice of a philosopher, and discover the
nature of your passion," she rose to her full height again, lifting
herself onto the desk, much to its creaking protest, and planted her
plush rear on its surface to look down on her previously impassable
wall, "and now, I'm looking forward to that glory of mounting it."</p>
<p>Her legs spread, showing off her provocative panties to him as she
watched the way he tried to hide behind his glasses. That telltale pink
was in his cheeks, deepening to a proper flustered red. He knew she was
onto his likes, and she could taste... Sour mint?</p>
<p>As Karen drew in her breath there was no denying it. That magical taste
was on her tongue, flowing into her and pooling in her core. Why though?
The book was back at her aunt's place, and clearly, she hadn't repeated
any of the spells within recently. So, what was happening?</p>
<p>"Is something wrong?" Allen asked, seeing the look of shock on her face;
concern for his student more powerful than any awkward arousal he was
dealing with.</p>
<p>It was a valid question, triggering the programmer in her. Each breath
she was drawing in more energy to fuel a transformation, the sensation
growing inside her chest and starting to reach out to her extremities.
All over, her skin tingled, and she could feel the beginnings of growth
starting up.</p>
<p>The redhead's leggings tightened, their tops slipping down her thighs
before one developed a run that filled the air with the light popping of
elastic threads. Her freshly purchased top was riding up her midriff,
exposing more of her pristine skin, the tight dip of her belly,
amplified by the magnificence of her bust. She'd already selected a bra
that would show off a little nipple, but now they had popped out,
standing hard on display and rubbing against the soft fabric of her
clothing as it seemingly shrunk around her.</p>
<p>The desk groaned beneath her, making what was happening all too obvious
as the sturdy wood began to buckle. "You're g-growing?" her professor
stammered.</p>
<p>Her leafy greens turned to him, to the straining erection he wasn't even
bothering to hide at the sight. This was turning him on, more than her
original buxom form, even when she'd been fully provoking him. The
realization hit her like a freight train: this was a fetish.</p>
<p>So, it wasn't just big girls. The grin returned to Karen's lips, her
smallest motions causing her clothes further distress as they struggled
to keep on her enormous frame. "I am," she leaned forward, offering her
deepening cleavage to him and reaching out. He didn't resist, letting
her lengthy fingers curl into the waist of his pants and pull him to
her, "You like, Allen?" she purred, pulling her shoulders back to let
the popping stitches of her bra fill his ears.</p>
<p>Words failed him, her face sitting inches above his own, bearing down on
him with that hungry smirk. That didn't mean his body wasn't answering.
Faced with the very manifestation of his unreal fantasies, he was almost
painfully hard, every ounce of his will devoted to trying to hold back
on principle. His dark eyes were wandering though, watching the already
scanty garb continue to shrink on her body, the strongest points
starting to dig in as their wearer continued to expand.</p>
<p>"I'm sure there's some philosophical rhetoric about taking
opportunities," the growing giantess continued, undoing his belt with
digits that were starting to become a tad too big for such a task as she
pushed up to the eighth foot mark, "When are you going to get another
chance at something like this?"</p>
<p>A point well made, as Karen finished up her delicate task and set his
cock free to force his zipper down in its eagerness. He was ready, all
she had to do now was give him the invitation.</p>
<p>Just sitting herself back up caused her outfit a flurry of issues. On
pure reflex she went with a classic, a body this big, however, was not
prepared to accommodate. Her skirt was practically painted on her
thighs, and the subtle motion of leaning back, spreading her legs to
show of her waiting sex, had it splitting with a profound rip that ran
from hem to hip. The runs in her tights now resembled erratic stripes,
sharp arrows that pointed down towards her heels, whose straps were
beginning to show gaps in their stitching. The true treasure though was
her panties, fighting with her hips and rear to wind up pulled so
tightly into her muff the stiff bud of her clit was obvious.</p>
<p>The delight of growing, the anticipation of finally catching her prey,
the combination had her soaked. Reaching down, an act that had the seam
of her top tearing open to let her half-restrained tits surge forward,
her lithe fingers peeled the line of fabric from her folds. "Well?" she
purred, fluttering those shining fields of green at him.</p>
<p>Most people will experience at least one moment in their lives, where
inhibitions are tossed out the window in favor of primal instinct, or
personal gain. The realization of the phrase, "Ah, fuck it." Karen had
seen it herself in many a man, but never had it been as satisfying as
now, watching her insurmountable obstacle finally break.</p>
<p>The brunette professor let his pants down, the belt buckle clattering to
the floor loud enough to overpower even the growing aches of the desk
beneath his giantess obsession's rear, and he climbed up into position.
She felt the head of his dick at her entrance, making her draw in a gasp
of magical air that tickled her tongue. Her growth surged by full inches
all at once, the band of her underwear snapping to fall slack, a second
large split running up her skirt, and the band of her bra finally
breaking to let loose tits larger than any normal-sized person could
hope to achieve. If her six-foot suitor could scale her massive form,
she had no doubt she could have wrapped them around the whole of his
upper body and still had plenty to spare.</p>
<p>His hands searched for purchase, her hips too wide to be taken without
him fully extending his arms; and even then, she was still getting
bigger. He settled for resting them on her thick thighs, half-over the
now nearly-transparent stockings, more hole than fabric, desperately
clinging to her body. The arousal of feeling her continue to grow
beneath his very fingers was nearly maddening, and with little
resistance he plunged his rod right to the hilt in her soaked channel.</p>
<p>The ruby-haired goddess gave a moan, the satisfaction of her victory
better than the sex itself. She let herself fall back, to just focus on
the feeling of his cock stroking her walls, the way his pelvis rammed
into her stiff button. Not the wisest of choices it turned out.</p>
<p>Her head hung over the edge if the desk, and with her full weight spread
across it the legs groaned in protest, before snapping and abruptly
dropping her to the floor. Splintered wood scattered about, and yet more
movement had the tattered remains of her clothing further destroyed and
awkwardly draping over her massive body. Mullins had stumbled forward
from the collapse, face landing in the underside of her cleavage, but
unhindered as he continued to savour the object of his fantasies with
further frenzied thrusts.</p>
<p>How big was she now? Just eyeballing it, she had to be twice his size,
and yet each breath she took in was still tingling her tongue with that
sour mint taste. Not only that, but her growth wasn't simply consistent,
but accelerating as her lungs grew deeper, flowing further energy into
her that moved to every part of her body. It was euphoric in ways she'd
never experienced.</p>
<p>Her first orgasm hit like a freight train, the fire in her loins
building up and exploding through her body as she let out an echoing
moan. She couldn't take hold of Allen, he was too small to anchor her
gigantic form, and so her hand jumped out and smashed into the wall with
enough force to crack the plastic surface of the whiteboard.</p>
<p>A startled gasp brought in more air, spiking her growth with another
full foot that destroyed any hope her clothes had left. Unrecognizable
shreds tumbled off her hyper-curvy form, landing all around only to
disappear beneath her as she grew. Her breasts expanded into the realm
of obscene; proportionately obscene. Their heavy mass was pouring over
her, each more than the size of a fully grown man, and blocking her
sight of the one still vigorously going at her as her walls quivered
around his length.</p>
<p>Riding out the high, every part of her was warm and sensitive. Her mind
was fuzzy, as each slip of his cock through her oversized channel, each
slap of his abs against her stiff clit, rocked her and kept her
teetering on the edge of another big "O". Still, she recognized a
problem. The restrictions of her clothing were now a non-issue, but that
didn't mean she wasn't still running out of space. Her left thigh, hot
to the touch from her climactic peak, was starting to press against the
wall.</p>
<p>She didn't want it to stop, to interrupt the pleasure running through
her, and undoubtedly neither did her professor if his diamond hardness
was an indicator; she needed to move though. Reaching down Karen found
her hand, while still slender and delicate, covered nearly all of his
back, her thumb and palm easily reaching shoulder to shoulder; and each
breath in she could feel her fingertips pushing further. There was no
doubt she was reaching into the twenties, standing would have her head
punching clean through the lecture hall ceiling.</p>
<p>Needs guiding her she pulled her playmate into her muff, the man letting
out a semi-startled shout as he was buried balls deep in her, and
started to shift. Her knee slammed into the wall, knocking the damaged
whiteboard to the ground. Her rear rose up with minimal effort from her
enormous body, though the crash of it coming down rumbled through the
room to let her, and likely most of the outside halls, just how heavy
she really was. When her arm swung back to find balance it broke through
the seats, a forearm wide as their backs more than enough to tear
through their supports and warp them as they were crushed beneath her;
and still, the redhead could feel herself continuing to expand, the
ruins raking across her skin as she continued to stretch outward.</p>
<p>Between thighs bigger than he was, Allen was still adjusting to the
move. What for her was just a simple shuffle of her ass had carried him
all the way from where his desk one stood, to the first row of seats.
Even securely held to her sex, whose labia ran from his hips to pecs, it
was still dizzying; a testament to just how large she was becoming. He
could hear her foot still hitting the wall behind him. Looking up, it
was a massive wall of tit-flesh that one could get lost in. There was so
much of her, all he could do was try and picture the giantess in his
mind's eye, and the image had his ready rod jumping inside her with an
eager burst of pre.</p>
<p>Ruby rivers ran through the walkways, from the tip of the growing
goddess' head down to her knees, shimmering in the light as they dragged
up the steps with each new inch. She could feel it, the shudder in the
man's fingers, trembling against the plush thickness of her legs, slowly
moving towards her sensitive button. Whether he'd just thought the
moment through, or had enough experience, he knew how to please a girl.</p>
<p>His comparatively tiny fingers wrapped her throbbing clit, massaging it
and making her squeal with ecstasy. Her body was thrown back, crushing
the stands beneath her more than five layers deep. Once more she was
rocked with a climax, her leg shooting out stiffly to nearly punch a
hole through the back wall as the sturdy brick buckled inward, her
steaming folds tightening and coating her puny lover with her liquid
love.</p>
<p>Soaked neck to knee Mullins hit his own limit. His grip tightened,
squeezing her abundant body like a little pinch, and with a mighty groan
he plunged deep and blasted the largest load of his life into her giant
chasm.</p>
<p>It was barely enough to dent her, but still, Karen felt the warmth of
his seed inside of her. That sour mint taste started to lessen, the
energy within her dying down as needs were sated; and never had she felt
such a sweet sense of victory. With a cat-like smile she relaxed into
the rubble, reveling in her self-satisfaction. "So," she purred once
she'd re-collected her wits, spreading her armfuls of tit to get a good
look at the insignificant little obstacle between her legs, "about my
grade."</p>
<p>The professor was red in the cheeks, still catching his breath as he
pushed himself back to his feet. "This was fun Miss Neff," he admitted,
fixing his glasses up his nose, "but, I'm afraid your grasp of the
source material is severely lacking. If you want to succeed in
philosophy, you need to let go of the literal and be more open-minded to
interpretation, to application in your future career as a software
developer."</p>
<p>The student could feel a cold sweat on her brow. "But we-" she
stammered, growing flush with renewed frustration, "I-"</p>
<p>"You're a big girl, Miss Neff," Allen joked, admiring her as he stepped
back, drinking in a woman six times his size, well over thirty feet tall
and curved to the extremes. A true fantasy. "But you're not a child
anymore, you're an adult, free to do as she pleases; as am I."</p>
<p>Adjusting the buttons of his top, he went about collecting his trousers.
"'The brave man is he who overcomes not only his enemies but his
pleasures.' Democritus, and something you could take insight from," he
pointed about the destroyed lecture hall, plenty to hold over her head
if she tried to manipulate or spin this against him.</p>
<p>Stunned, all the redhead could do was huff in annoyance. All of this,
and she still didn't even get her marks. Not only that, her aunt's book
of magic was far off from being able to help with a new problem: How a
giantess with tits like small cars was going to fit through an
eight-foot door frame.</p>
