Meeting someone was always difficult. Finding people in the city wasn’t hard, that wasn’t the problem. But finding a person willing to go on a date with you, that proved to be a hurdle too high. At least for me.



I don’t know if I missed a class during high school, or whether I was just defective. I could never seem to go from small talk with a woman, to, ‘Hey would you like to go on a date?’.



Only Twenty-Two but already an unviewed loser on all the free dating sites, profile pic of an average white-boy nothing like all the others. Any friends I once made, were now studying at universities in different corners of the land, leaving me in a dead-end job straight after graduation. I could imagine my entire life stretch out before me, my fellow workers looking how I might saw myself becoming in the future, if nothing changed.



Shortly after making the stark realisation was when I created all the dating profiles. That was 4 years ago. Since then I had received precisely zero-messages and a sinking feeling of how utterly worthless I was, was an all too familiar one.



That was until today. 



Sitting at the computer, he first personally addressed email to me in a long while, not automatically generated or trying to sell me something, pinged up on the screen. Normally this one escape from my shitty-life went uninterrupted, so having to pause for anything was unwelcome. If it had been someone at the door, it more awkward than anything else.



At least with an email I wouldn’t have to try and conceal by erection. Night after night, the usual websites never failed to illicit the same enjoyment. However, they weren’t the sort of sites people would casually find themselves on, so were something I did like to keep to myself.



That made me smile, like I had any other choice but keep it to myself.



The email had a tag line from one of my dating profiles, so I eagerly opened it despite the slight intrusion into my private time. There was no profile picture from the sender. Slightly concerning as a genuine message would have had one, but curiosity outweighed my scepticism.



There was only one line saying to meet them in the side-room of a club at 9pm. I wasn’t familiar with the name, but I knew where the address was.



The Perverse Cabaret? I read, wondering what on earth made someone think I would let myself fall for something so stupid. The name did ring a bell though, not that I could place it.



It was obviously someone playing a trick on me, perhaps trolling many different profiles just hoping to find a loser desperate enough to show up. No doubt they’d be in wait with their cameras ready, just waiting to upload the look on a person’s face when they realised it was all a cruel joke. 



About to dismiss it entirely, I gave it another look and reread the subject line. When it had first popped up, my eyes had caught the part that had my username and I had gone from there. Only now did I realise the username was followed by another username of mine, one that was not on any dating profile.



It was a username I used for a particularly expensive cam-site. The subscription to view alone cost the same as I imagined having a girlfriend might, only the girls you’d see on the various channels were nothing like you could possibly find in real-life.



I presumed it was good CGI and special effects but there were always those in the comments that insisted it was actual magic. I knew these sites attracted the lonely and desperate, that’s why I was there after all, so I paid it little mind. The quality of their videos was astounding and the fantasies and fetishes on display couldn’t be found anywhere else.



There was no way to tell how they accomplished it, but there was nothing else like them on the internet. Even of what I could afford would rival the production value of most Hollywood films, only being matched by their notoriety. I had only found the site after receiving a private invitation, a chance encounter on a message thread. The rest was history and they had been receiving a portion of my pay-check ever since. 



The email now took on a different light. It was strange that they had used two unrelated usernames, but if there was a chance that I was being invited to one of the studios, then they could use whatever they liked. 



Still, it bugged me a little. The invitation sounded more like a date than some sort of tour. This could all still be a prank, only now it’d be guaranteed to find its way onto the internet. It could also end up ruining this one escape for me, but the thought of seeing these girls up close – that was just too tempting to refuse.



Not taking me long to get there, there wasn’t a queue and after a brief but awkward encounter with some uptight bouncers, I was in the club.



The inside didn’t look much like a studio, or at least not what I thought a studio should look like. Sure, it had lights and a sound system but the throngs of people raving and dancing, wasn’t something I had seen on any of the channels. 



‘That’s where I remember it from’ I thought to myself, feeling like I’d finally solved a puzzle. I hadn’t seen this room on any of the channels but there had been one show a while back that I had been called the ‘Perverse Cabaret’. I had only ever seen a promo, the contents locked behind a pay-wall that would have bankrupted me. It was the name and something about the way the people around me were dressed, that made the connection in my mind



It was a thrill. It had cost me no more than a regular club to get in, but now I was standing in a place I couldn’t even afford to see on the internet. I wondered if the people around me knew how lucky they were. Feeling all hesitation slip away and letting my body start to move with the beat, I lost myself to the crowd and music.



Time didn’t seem to have any meaning as I danced among wildly dressed clubbers. After a while, I remembered the invitation, it had said to meet someone at 9. It wasn’t quite time yet but thought that taking my own tour of the place would be interesting.



The atmosphere was dreamlike. There wasn’t any dress-code that I could discern, observing that many were barely dressed at all. Occasionally someone passed by absent any clothing at all, but paid no attention by anyone else around them. On the other end of the spectrum, there were people with very elaborate costumes and others dressed in full-body suits of various animals and characters. A literal menagerie of of fantasies.



I explored a couple of the rooms connected to the main dance hall, the first was a creepy dungeon with a lot of darkly-dressed rockers, hiding away from the preppy and trendy masses. This wasn’t really my scene, so I continued through the club’s interior, finding several other elaborately themed rooms.



After getting a little thirsty, I settled myself into a room towards the outer edge of the building. Many of the clubbers filtering off before reaching it, leaving it peaceful in comparison. My surroundings looked like it had been plucked straight out of Aladdin or Arabian Nights, a more old-fashioned take on the hookah-bars popping up everywhere.



Walking over to a booth in one of the corners, I ordered a drink from one of the hostesses dressed in skimpy belly-dancer outfit. The very curvy hostess returned quickly with a glass, smiling as she put it down in front of me. Next to my drink was a glass bowl and several pipes leading from its slim neck, smoke rising from the top and filling the air with a sweet, sickly smell. I didn’t mind but wondered if whoever I was meeting would find me in here, watching as the hostess walked away.



I drank my beer and watched as the hosts and hostesses tended to everyone, moving around the room replacing coals and refilling drinks. All of them were appropriately dressed like my hostess had been, with the male hosts topless and wearing loose fitting pants. Every now and then, one of them would lean in, whispering something to one of the customers. Without fail, the person and their group, if they had come with one, would rise and move towards another room.



None of them ever seemed angry about being asked to move, the opposite seemed true. After the host would leave, the customer they had spoken to would always have a smile on their face and would look excited.



9 o’clock.



The music stopped mid song and a few moments later, what sounded like a poem played through the speakers. I couldn’t make it out properly, still a little preoccupied with the strangeness of it all, but I did make out the rather androgynous voice bellow, 



PERVERSE CABARET as the poem found its end, music resuming shortly after.



My suspicions confirmed, I looked around to see if there was any sign of someone looking for me. I was certainly in the right place, it was 9 o’clock, but the lack of a specific room to meet in meant I was still unsure what to do.



As answering my question, a sharply-dressed gentleman took a seat next to me, the cushioned booth shaking under him. He shuffled to get comfortable before waving at a hostess, the same one from before, bringing him a drink just as quickly.

Easing into the chair even further after a long swig of his drink, the man looked right at me.



Thank you for making it. I trust you’re enjoying yourself? he said without any doubt that he was talking to the right person.



Are you the one who sent me the message I said before going any further, wanting to make sure this guy wasn’t just some random trying to chat me up.



Yes, well no. Not me personally but I put in a request and they matched me up with you for tonight’s date. He responded. The smile he wore a second ago diminishing slightly, but not fading entirely.



I thought someone might be pranking me. Looks like they got you too. I said, feeling sorry for him but not as sorry as I felt for myself. If this was being recorded then I hoped whoever they were got what they wanted, not feeling sure whether this was worse than having no one showing up at all.



You’re Donny Bill, right? The man asked.



Yes, but I tried to start, but the man with a wide grin back on his face, cut me off.



Nope, this is the right place. There’s no prank.



Thinking about how desperate this man must be, much more than I considered myself, stopped me from saying what I should’ve. Looking him over, he certainly wasn’t charmless. The suit looked expensive and where I could see he wasn’t so young any more, only seemed to add to an overall sense of handsomeness the man possessed.



What’s you name? I asked him.



Phillip O. Quinn I wondered where the ‘O’ appeared in his name momentarily, forgetting I had a rather nasty thing to tell Mr ‘Philip O’Quinn’.



Look Phil, and I’ll call you Phil because I hope this comes across as gently as I intend it to. I’m not really into guys and the profile they matched you to says that. I’m really sorry.



He seemed to take it well, too well. 



I see the confusion now. They don’t match me to some username or profile. They matched me to you. They’re never wrong  



Like I said, I’m not really into guys I replied, knowing it wasn’t entirely true even as the words left my mouth. That wasn’t something I was ready to deal with yet, especially like this.



Well neither am I 



That took me by surprise. The man didn’t seem disappointed by finding me here. Not only that, but he was expecting me by name. That all made sense if he believed I was gay, or if he was at least, but sitting here now – the situation seemed completely beyond my grasp.



That’s why we’re here. Phil continued, When the show ends, everyone normally returns to their old lives the next day. Sometimes though, and usually after being on the waiting list for a while, the next day comes and something else is awaiting you.



To me it sounded all too cryptic, but he shuffled nearer to me as he said this and knew he wasn’t being coy. It was like walking in half-way during a film, it makes sense to everyone else but you’re left clueless. 



We usually only find it after we lose everything that makes our old-lives bearable, but that loss opens up an opportunity to find something else. For you and me, that is something both of us have been lacking.



This is a place that will let you become what you have always desired. That’s why we’re here. He finished.



I didn’t know what I was feeling, let alone what to say to him. Staring deep into me, it was like he could see my confusion. My mind rebelling against the awakening part of me that had always existed, the part that wanted to fulfil my sexual urges and didn’t care how it achieved them. In amongst the desires for the women I regularly saw on the internet, there was always a pang of envy. 



To be lusted over, adored or even just used.



The part of me that wanted these things didn’t feel like it belonged to the rest of myself, but in exploring these desires, I wasn’t sure that was quite right. Sometimes that piece of me felt like the most honest part, with the rest of my personality being an elaborately crafted costume just to hide behind.



If you’re not gay, then it doesn’t really matter what we’ve been lacking. Even if this might be something I could like, and that’s a big ‘IF’, what’s in it for you? I asked him, feeling my throat tighten. I coughed but it sounded wrong. 



Coughing again, trying to clear my throat, the man next to me chuckled.



I think you’re finding out he quipped at me.



Looking around, I couldn’t see any other eyes but his on me. Feeling like I was missing something crucial, I reached for my throat.



Something really didn’t feel right, my throat feeling smaller. Looking at my hand, I could see it too appeared smaller than it should be. It didn’t look like a child’s hand though; my fingers had slimmed and palm-span reduced but then I recognised them for what they were. 



They’re the hands of a woman I said looking down in shock. My voice took me even further by surprise, coming out higher than it should, unmistakably feminine.



What’s happening? I squeaked in panic.



Easy there Donny, that’s a good girl Phil calmly said, taking my hands in his.



Him calling me a girl felt humiliating, trying to pull free of his grip, I realised my arms and torso had also diminished. Feeling too weak and powerless to do anything, I looked him in the eyes.



I don’t want to be a girl I cried.



Now we both know that’s not true. This couldn’t happen if you didn’t really want it somewhere deep down. He retorted, almost condescendingly.



I said that it’s in our most desperate times, that we are able to seize new opportunities. This couldn’t have happened till you had honestly ruled out every other way of being truly happy for yourself. 



Most can only bear giving their lives up for a short time or they find it only possible once survival is concerned, like when they need a job. But for you, in your heart of hearts – you know this is the only way.



I struggled to get free of his hands, much larger than my own now, but couldn’t find the strength. I had to sit there as I felt the skin all over my body buzz and tingle. Not knowing for sure, but it felt like my flesh was inflating, looking at my skinny arms I watched as they became soft, creamy and hairless. I was sure the rest of my body matched what I was seeing, feeling my now oversized clothes rubbing against new, sensitive skin.



My face flushed as parts of it pushed in and pushed out, my nose and jaw shrinking and my lips growing more luscious. My eyes seemed larger now my face had become a smaller, feminised version of itself. The trickle of hair falling past my ears and brushing my neck, was the last change I experienced before Phil spoke again;



You look lovely, Donny. Or perhaps, Donna would be better suited for you now? I could tell that he was only half-asking me. He was still wearing the same grin he had throughout and seemed to be enjoying what was happening to me. I supposed I was Donna now.



Honestly Donna, stop fighting it. You’ll feel so much better.



Why me? I whined, Why do this to me?



For you. I’m doing this for you Donna. You’ll see that soon. Why don’t you relax, this next bit should help you feel more comfortable, my dear.



With that, he let go of my hands and I went to get up. As I did, my ill-fitting clothes drew in tight around me. The jeans I had been wearing started dissolving until I could see the shape of my new female legs being revealed. The fabric stopped dissolving around my thighs and what hadn’t disappeared, reformed itself into a skirt.



My hips and thighs were much larger than before I had sat down, craning my neck around, I could see my own fat butt-cheeks pushing the skirt up behind me. My widening hips causing the skirt to flair out comically, protruding far enough to rest my hand on them. I stood there groping at my new thick flesh incredulously, unable to recognise myself.



Without pause, the changes continued to my top. The tight fabric becoming constrictive as I felt the pressure build around my chest. Watching two breasts emerge from my torso, slowly at first but gaining pace when Phil seemed to notice

.

How big would you like them? He said, only half-asking again I like them big. I reckon you probably will too.



I was transfixed by the mounds of flesh steadily pushing out from my body, feeling my nipples become tender and sore against the fabric of my impossibly tight shirt. Their size had passed modest long ago and were expanding past what I guessed double HH’s might look like, awkwardly squeezed into the top as they were. 



While my tits began gaining definition and weight, it felt like my shirt was finally ripping apart but could instead feel it slowly start to recede up from my waist and creep down from my collar. What was left of it formed tightly around my bust, tightening into a strapless boob tube. It felt nice having my new additions firmly kept in place, but also caused the soft tit-flesh to overflow at the top. I could feel my new breasts being pressed together and their prominent cleavage filled my view, to the point I could no longer see my lower half.



The enlarged nipples them poked through the stretched fabric of my new dress, more prominently than ever. Their sensitivity drew my hands upwards and I soon found that, while incredibly tender, they were extremely fun to play with. I had completely forgotten about Phillip still sitting there, he was seemingly content to watch me explore myself.



Strange thoughts and sensations flooded into me as I felt my old-self wash away, the parts of my personality not compatible with my form no longer feeling necessary. All that remained was the deep core of my being, the one that had been hidden and kept secret for so long. Its burning desire to be lusted after and used for pleasure, no matter what form it took.



Somehow this felt like cheating. A long-hidden desire may have desperately wanted this but surely  the cost couldn't be the rest of me? Not only had my body been feminised beyond recognition, but I could feel it in my mind that my thoughts were becoming just as female – no longer able to think of myself as a guy.



I knew, intellectually, that I had been a man walking into the club, but standing there now, all I could feel was how right my sensuous female body really was. Finally feeling at home in my own skin, something I couldn’t have considered possible before.  



Experiencing the strangeness of it all whilst there in the club, my mind tried to rebel against the pleasure I felt. With my ripe form squeezed tight into what clothing I had left to preserve my dignity, or what little I could salvage after being so thoroughly dominated, my very body betrayed me. Every movement, every breath, rewarding submission to my new urges with ever increasing levels of pleasure. Merely the feel of my breasts in my delicate hands sent waves of electricity through me, making my knees weak with arousal.



My hips bucked in response to the fondling and rather unwelcomingly, could feel my flaccid cock shift between my thighs. It felt so alien hanging their and for a moment was entirely repulsed by it, my new female mind expecting to feel something else.



I froze and no longer felt so comfortable. Phillip saw this and patted the a cushion, inviting me to move next to him.



I sat down obediently where he'd indicated, feeling my hands go behind me, instinctively pulling the back of my skirt over ham-sized cheeks so my dress didn’t ride further up my butt. Some corner of my mind was still surprised how natural everything felt and differently my body moved from before. The only part not feeling like it belonged was still between my legs, one-last relic of my masculinity.



It looks like you’ve come around. He said, brushing my long brown hair aside to get a better look at my face, You have turned out rather beautifully, I hope you’re happy to hear.



While still feeling weird about the feeling under my skirt, the compliment took me by surprise with how much it made me feel better. The feeling of my man appreciating me. Knowing he wanted me, desired me. It felt primal.



Do I really look, okay? I managed to ask, half-fishing for another compliment but also wanting to know for certain he liked me. His approval was something I began to feel desperate for, like as long as he was happy – nothing else mattered.



My dear, you are more than I could have hoped for. Though I think we both know there’s one more thing between us that needs to change, before we go any further. 



Leaning in, he placed a hand on my knee. The feel of his skin on mine reassuringly firm, as he started to slide his fingers along the inside of my creamy thigh, higher and higher. His hand approached my groin, disappearing beneath my skirt, feeling the sensitivity of my flesh heighten beyond my mind’s ability to function. As he creeped towards me, expecting to feel his fingers meet my shrivelled manhood, all I felt was nothing.



He pushed further and I felt the air meet my sensitive flesh and flow inside me, a void appearing in my groin and driving deep within my body. His fingers were gently massaging the developing folds of my labia, occasionally catching all that remained of my penis now that now took its place as an engorged clitoris. Among all the new nerves and organs that were forming, I couldn’t possibly tell which was most sensitive, all seemed equally able to reduce my mental capacity to its current animal-like delirium .



I just sat there, allowing this stranger to feel me up. His hands stirring overwhelming needs for sexual release and filling me with contentment. I was in my place, where I belonged. I belonged to this man with his hand between my legs.



I grunted from pleasure and the strange pushing I felt deep inside me. New female organs forming with what was left of my balls becoming ovaries, feeling them glow with fertility.

Oooohhhh I sighed involuntarily.



At last, one of Philip’s fingers encroached past my folds, into my expectant vagina. I could feel warmth blooming from inside it, radiating outwards till my womanhood became wet with uncontrollable arousal.



I moaned even louder as his fingers slipped inside me. They probed and caressed my new pussy’s tender flesh and sent waves of pleasure crashing through me. My muscles were so unsure how to respond that I was left flailing helplessly, completely at the mercy of Philip and my new form.

He slowly withdrew his hand from under my skirt, leaving me feeling empty and yearning for him to continue. Briefly sniffing at his own fingers, he held them under my nose.



That’s what you smell like now. He said, laughing as he did.



Not really knowing what was coming over me, I couldn’t deny the muskiness of my own scent and the more I breathed in, the more curious I became. Before either of us had realised, my mouth was around one his fingers, letting my tongue explore the tastes of my own body’s juices.



You really have come along, haven’t you? he said, surprised.



I nodded in reply, still savouring the taste of myself on his fingers before he removed them, left to sit there unsure what to do next. My arousal was so complete that the heavy cloud of orgasmic bliss hadn’t yet lifted from my mind. 



Some echo of my former self felt worried. A vestigial concern that I had forgotten things or had in fact grown dumber through the changes. What if I would forever be trapped in this fog of baffling horniness, never able to form a coherent thought before the allure of my own body consumed me again. 



‘If I should be so lucky’ I thought evilly to myself. The idea that I would forever be a dumb, sex-bitch for my Phil didn’t just feel good, it made my pussy froth with delight.



Any other musings easily floated away when I looked at the man next to me. It was like my vision only focused on him, the whole world a blur from how little anything else mattered. It wasn’t love, nothing so temporary. It was a base, deep and permanent. A primal desire that overtook rational thought and meant I was his forever.



Without even having to tell my body, one of my hands was already at his crotch, feeling the cock beneath his pants hardening as I took old of it. Phillip unzipped and let me do the rest, leaning himself back into the chair as I let myself slide down. His cock looked delicious reaching out from his pants, throbbing and erect.



I kissed it and let my tongue caress the head before driving it into my mouth. Letting the warmth radiate inside my cheeks and meet the back of my throat before I start letting my instincts take over. 



Working him like a pro, I could hear him moaning now and it made me glow with happiness. The thought I was pleasing him filled me with more than joy, it gave me purpose. Doubling my efforts, it wasn’t long until he grunted, letting his cock erupt into my mouth.



I felt him spasm and twitch within, its warmth almost burning me but coming away never crossed my mind. Instead I carried on, letting his cock spray into my waiting mouth.



I only came up after swallowing so much, I could barely breathe - spluttering as I did. Sensing Phillip sink into the seat next to me, fresh from his own orgasm, I sat for a moment letting the warm cum run down my throat. I savoured the taste and used my hands to make sure I didn’t miss a drop around my lips. 



He looked at me and I returned him a messy smile. 



I can see why they matched you with me. You really were ready to give in. He said, They told me that to get what I wanted would take a while – but you my dear were worth the wait.

I gave them a request for someone ready to give into my every desire, someone who would please themselves by pleasing me. 



He was more-or-less saying this to himself. I looked at him and I listened, but nothing seemed to register. It was like being in a play and knowing it wasn’t my line yet, I would know when needed to do something and sitting here obediently for him should be my only concern.



That, they told me wasn’t impossible. What did prove to be a stickler was finding someone who wouldn’t want to change back down the road. That and the conditioning, of course.



‘Conditioning?’ I thought with more effort than it should have taken me. Something seemed to click and make sense, but I couldn’t really tell if it was important.



Once we’re out of here, you’ll see you really have struck gold. I’m not Yacht rich, but I am certainly never-have-to-lift-a-finger-again, rich. We can even come back here whenever you like. In the meantime, I do want to make sure the conditioning works before we leave



I just smiled dreamily at him, doubting he needed my input.



I had them put a few commands with the magic. Just to keep things interesting. Now if you could stand up, please.



I did so without missing a beat, wondering if that was one of the commands. Feeling as submissive as I did, it didn’t seem likely. Thinking about it, there wasn’t anything I already wouldn’t willingly do for him. Anything he asked of me I would immediately comply with.



Bigger he said. 



Confused, I searched his face for meaning. His eyes were on me, but more specifically, they were aimed at my tits. That moment, I felt the top of my dress gradually slip over my nipples, exposing them until the weight of my growing boobs allowed them to break free and hang there in the open.



I was already playing with them as the skin stretched underneath my wandering hands, desperately trying to release the pressure building beneath them. My nipples were tiny thumbs sticking out of dinner plate areola, the mass of my swelling breasts pushing them further and further away from my body until gravity started pulling on them them.



Stop he finally says.



Walking over to me, he was visibly impressed by my growth. I stood there happily presenting myself to him, needing to use my arms and hands just to prevent my gigantic tits pulling me forward. Squeezing one of my nipples, he watched my eyes close tight in satisfaction. Their sensitivity had increased proportionally to their size and the cool air of the club made needing my hands to pleasure myself redundant, at least in theory. I still found it impossible to stop playing with my engorged teats.



Might as well even you out a little He continued after walking around me.



This time I felt the hem of my skirt sneak up my leg towards my again widening hips. The flesh of my thighs thickening until my butt pushed further behind me. I could feel my spine bend and force my hips back until I felt my vagina curve with them, forcing my belly to protrude a little and chest stick out even more.



My bottom had already been made massive from the initial changes, but the most recent ones made me feel like a baby machine on two legs. My lower half stopped expanding once Phil requested it to, but not before my skirt had been forced above the curve of my arse. With increasing futility, I tried to pull what remained of it over my front, but my wide hips and swollen form prevented much adjustment.



I was as naked as the clubbers I’d seen earlier, the room still seem as disinterested as ever in the weirdness overtaking me. Vague thoughts of why no one seemed to ogling the sight of me, a naked and incredibly voluptuous woman now completely exposed to the world, did cross my mind but vanished just as quickly. All I needed was Phillip to notice me.



Seeing you like that now, I don’t have the heart to reduce them again. I hope you don’t mind He wasn’t asking again, but I couldn’t care less. I was just happy my body pleased him.



Please I began, Can I do more for you? I want to do more, need to do more for you. Please 

Still in the throes of my body’s influence, I just wanted to keep expanding forever if it made him even happier.



I was going to save this till later, but I suppose here and now is as perfect as anywhere. Why don’t you come here? He says, gesturing to his lap.



I walk over and begin to crouch again when he stops me.



No, turn around. He said firmly, as if he were talking to a pet.



Seeing his cock erect again filled me with a hunger, and an itching sensation that led me to the right conclusion. My pussy was sopping wet from excitement when I turned, could feel Phillip start to play with it again.



I think you’re in heat He smirked.



With my enhanced proportions, I had to lower myself carefully onto him. The moment I felt my waiting cunt envelop him, my brain flickered. I could feel the heat of his warm-blooded monster deep inside, pressing into places that shouldn’t have existed yet felt too right to deny.



I tried gaining leverage in hopes of riding him, but the swell of the flesh under me made it near impossible. Lifting himself forward, but without ever leaving me, I feel him guide my weight into the table, letting my enormous breasts fall atop of it and knocking the glass hookah to the floor with a smash.



He continued thrusting into me like there was no tomorrow, I could feel my hips responding to him and pushing back into his. All the new muscles I had within me were clenching tight, embracing him as completely as my female form possibly could. Despite my body being rocked so much, I watched as the hostess from earlier clean the mess I had just made. She stole a quick glance of me but just smiled, walking away again.



In my stupor, new thoughts and desires overtook my brain. I wanted him to fill me up, to spill his see within me and plant his child within my belly. Feeling an overwhelming need to be impregnated by him, to be so utterly his and swollen with child, that I couldn't move. It didn't matter about anything else, my hungry pussy was now a baby factory for him to use.



Gripping the table to stop being pushed further atop of it, I felt my man’s cock twitch within me and my cunt squeeze tight around him. The deep desire to be made his came true as he spilled his load in me, my body milking him hungrily to fill my womb. The gush of his cum filled every part me, feeling it build behind my netherlips until the pressure sent it trickling down my legs.

Phillip withdrew from me, an audible ‘slurp’ over the music.



I lay there, bent over the table in post coital bliss. Every part of me felt numb to the touch and satisfied on a deep biological level, while the feeling his cum pooling inside me made me glow. The primal desire to carry his child burned within me, feeling my loins yearn for him. From the sheer amount his cock had released, I was certain he had impregnated me already, but desperately wanted to keep trying.



Pulling me back into the chair, he wrapped his arms around me and I melted into him. I felt his hand grope my tender breast as we sat there together. His other, began to stretch across my belly and I heard him whisper,



Bigger.



Starting to feel the same tingle in my skin from the other changes, I let my eyes fall to my stomach where I saw his hand gently being pushed away from me. Where my huge breasts still obscured my view, his hand slowly emerged resting on my expanding dome of a belly. He’d heard my wish.

I was completely his. Everyone would see my belly and know I had a man to protect me, a man who had spilled his seed into my cunt and put a child in my belly. I was so thoroughly submitted to him, he could have a hundred wives and I’d be no less devoted. The weight in my gut a constant reminder that I belonged to him.



It was like I was being inflated, the pressure I had felt when it was merely his cum in me had been enough. Now I could feel the underside of my belly brushing my thighs and stretching my pussy along its now protruding curve.



The pressure forced its way up through and inside me, watching as my huge belly curved outwards, now looking full-term with twins and gradually forcing my tits aside.



I sat there cradling it, full of maternal warmth. Phil still a hand on my expanding belly and once I looked ready to give birth any second, he whispered, Stop in my ear.



I couldn’t believe what I was seeing, let alone feeling. I couldn’t tell if they were real babies, but the weight certainly didn’t feel less than I imagined a pregnant belly would be. I couldn’t move, the mass of my form pinning me to the chair.



Phillip nodded to one of the Hostesses and she disappeared, coming back a few moments later with a folded pile of clothes. As he retrieved them, my nipples began to let-down. With the swell of my belly, I had completely missed by breasts gaining yet another cup-size. They looked swollen and tight than before and felt even more so. An alien sensation started to build under my nipples, but I instinctively knew what was happening. Reaching up to meet the feeling, I was rewarded instantly by warm-streams of milk leaking out of both of my tender nipples.



By now Philip had retrieved a bra from the pile he had been handed, looking at how tiny the garment was compared to my bust, he put it back down. The only thing in the pile that looked like it might add to my modesty than detract, was practically a sack.



His hand indicating to stand, my body was already in the process of doing so. Helping me to find the skirt and top that had been swallowed into the creamy folds of my expansion, we manage to remove them quite ungracefully.



He lifted the new dress above my head and pushing my arms up, we let the cloth fall over me. It barely passed my belly and with how far it was pulled forward, only covered the top half of my arse. My newly leaking tits had already created dark, wet-spots on my front and could feel the slow dribble of the milk rolling down my form.



I may have looked like a brood mare from the stables, but the look on Phillips face told me I was the hottest thing he had ever seen. I don’t know which aroused him more, my body or my utter willingness to let him use it however he wished.  



I think it’s time we were getting home. Don’t you my lovely.



I just stared at him; my mind still unsure how to handle the overwhelming nature of my transformations. I didn’t even realise I was nodding happily. 



As we left, arm in arm, him helping to guide my gravid form through the club – I could see why no one now had paid me any attention. Except for a lone older-man standing in the middle of one of the side-rooms, just staring into space, the floor was carpeted by the writhing forms of the clubbers.



Most had undergone some sort of transformation, looking around I suddenly felt like I had barely changed at all. Compared to some of the multi-legged, half-animal and impossible-to-tell transformations, my form looked positively mundane. 



None of this really mattered to me. If Phillip got bored of my appearance, then I’m sure we would pay another visit to the place of our first date.



For now, I was content to waddle with him, to do whatever he desired. I had finally found my match and it was time to go home. The way he groped my body told me there was much more to come.
