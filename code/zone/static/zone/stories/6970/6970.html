<p>Unknown Worlds 2 : Cruise</p>
<p>An expansion short story by . Thi is for adults only, So you knowif you should be reading this. </p>
<pre><code>Julia had never shown that evening.



She had just disappeared, and Chet hadn't seen her all day. Chet wandered the boat looking and asked around, but all he got was confusing conversations and understanding looks.



This sucked.



He was flying last night and was now grounded.



He roamed the ship, hoping to find her. There were deck chairs, open exercise rooms, and modern conveniences that were shoehorned into what was an antique boat. A yoga class was in session and active. He eventually stumbled upon a bar in the bow of the ship. Close enough.



It was called the Maelstrom. There was a small bar, an overlook into the ocean, and a few tables where he could have drinks. A few people were on the deck, and one woman was at the bar, talking to the bartender. Chet walked over to the bar.



"What can I get you, Sir, "Rafael said from behind the bar.



"Do you have any specials?" Chet asked.



"No, Sir, we do not have any specials, but we do have a wide selection of unique drinks. "Rafael said.



"OK, what have you got? "



"Well, our drink for first-timers is to have people try our namesake the Maelstrom. Once you get a taste of a Maelstrom, we can figure out where to go from there. "Rafael started to pull ingredients from around the bar.



"Maybe I should just start with something simple. "Chad said.



Chet didn't see Rafael nod to the small bleach-blonde woman sitting across the bar from Chad. Rafael had filled Elise in on the situation about Chet. Julia had spent the night with Chet, and she was supposed to find out how he was doing.



Elise leaned over and started talking with Chet.



"Well, I don't know about you, but I came on this ship for adventure. Didn't you? "



"I came on this trip because it was free. But now it seems I am just being let down once again. "



"Cheer up! That means that you already have a headstart", Elisee said.



Chet looked confused.

"You want me to look at the bright side of this? How do you know I even can look on the bright side of things?"



"The ship has a pretty wild reputation. If you are all messed about something already, then I probably know what happened." Elise winked awkwardly at Chet several times.



"OK, I guess you are right. But how can this ship have a reputation like that?! I looked into the ship before I got on, and I found nothing online." Chet said.



"You see! It's only a matter of time before you start having excellent adventures. "Elise asked, ignoring the second part of Chet's response.



"Yeah, I had a bit of a thing this morning, and I don't know where to go from here. I don't know what I want. I don't even know if I am having a good time. "Chad said.



"Oh yeah, that sounds terrible. You wonder if the 'thing' that happened you this morning was the right type of fun to be having? It sounds like the world's worst problem."



"Hey, I mean, it is a new thing for me," Chet said.



"You had a fling with someone this morning, didn't you?" Elise had known Julia to run off with guys that looked similar to Chet.



"You can either run with it, ignore it, or move on. But after you decide what you want, I think you can get it on this trip."



Chet was about to interrupt, but he was drawn short by the statement.



"I can find what I want on this trip? I only have to know what it is?" Chet reiterated.



"Yeah, it just happens that most people don't know what they want, so they let other people decide for them. "Elise said.



"Thanks, that is," Chet paused, "healthy advice."



"Well, it looks like we're gonna be here for the rest of the week. Let's catch up again. I haven't found any drinking buddies on the ship and could use more people to talk to. "Elise said pointedly at Rafael. She stood up from the bar and signed a tab Rafael had placed in front of her.



"Where are you going? "Chet asked.



"I have to get going. I've got an appointment with a friend. But I'll be back here later. "She said.



"Are you going to be getting into a thing?" Chet asked.



"Oh, I am going to try," Elise said. "Hey, look. Yoga just got out. "



Elise ducked out of the bar and wove in between the group of women. Elise gave Chet the OK with her hand and winked as she left the bar.



"Here you are, Sir, one Maelstrom. "Rafael placed a drink down on the counter. Rafael looked from side to side and tried to find Elise, but she had left while he was still making the drink.



Chet took the drink. He looked for something to get unstuck in his life, and this was as good as any place to start. The Maelstrom was served in a highball glass and was still spinning around from the stirring that Rafael had just given it. As he sipped the Maelstrom, blue liqueur swirled but never mixed with something white in the glass.



A tingle ran up Chet's inner thighs. The drink was delicious, yes, but there's something else to it. Something that chilled him more than ice and warmed him better than alcohol.



"I could drink these all week," Chet thought to himself as h walked out to the observation deck.



Chet froze in the doorway. There were other people on the observation deck drinking, but none of them noticed the waves. The made conversation and looked over the ocean.



The ocean rose upward so high that there was no sky anymore. It rolled back onto itself. The horizon was the inside barrel of a wave they were riding. It was so pervasive that Chet didn't know if they were headed up or down the wave. He did feel a pull towards the iris that formed where the ocean looped into tighter and tighter spirals until there was just a single point in the distance.



Chet was struck by how quiet everything was, There should have been roaring as the water fell into itself, but there was just ocean everywhere the eye could see. Chet could see small waves on the sea, and all of his perspective lines were off. It looked like everything eventually spiraled to a point perpendicular to the boat.



Chet stared at the swirling vortex. With each passing second, he could see farther into the distance. His eyes seemed to zoom into the center of the Maelstrom. He was frozen in place. Able to hear and take in everything, but the spiral was too much to take in.



He could hear someone at the bar ask Rafael a question. He was able to focus on something else. It took a lot of willpower, but his feet moved to spin him, looking away from the spiral. It was still there, however. Chet could feel it moving behind him.



"So why is it called the Maelstrom?" the guest asked. She was a middle-aged woman in purple tight yoga pants, a sports bra, and a towel. She had come into the bar with a group of women that Chet had seen doing yoga earlier.



"It's an inside joke. The Captain named the bar after something he saw at sea once." Rafael asked.



"Is the drink named after that thing too?" the woman was curling her hair in her fingers.



"No, the drink is called that because It helps you see the joke." Rafael was leaning into the conversation farther and farther to get a shared personal space.



Chet was still standing in the entryway to the observation deck.



"Just going to squeeze by ya here, youngin." an old man said. The old man saw that Chet's face was white. "You doin' alright, son?"



Chet was not doing alright.



The old man placed a hand on Chet's back and started to guide him back into the bar. He was a short but powerful man. Chet was hesitant, but he could tell he didn't have a real choice in the matter. He wanted to leave, but his feet wouldn't let him. The old man provided the deciding vote between his head and his legs.



"Rafael, can I get you over here for a bit." The old man said.



"I'll just be one-second ladies, I will be back soon." Rafael came over to the old man.



Chet was so zoned out from the observation deck, that he didn't even hear them talking. He had focused on the group of women. They had all started to gather around Rafael before he had left, and several of them were taking the time to primp and preen for when Rafael got back.



But there was more than just preening and primping. Chet saw one woman readjust her sports bra after the breasts that it contained started to rise and expand from medium to a medium-large set packed into a tighter bra. One woman in the back of the group began to grow upwards, with Chet seeing more and more of her face. The middle-aged women that had started the conversation now looked to be in her mid-thirties instead of her fifties.



Chet was reminded of what had happened yesterday with Julia.



"Elise was here?!" the old man suddenly said, bringing Chet our of his thousand-yard stare.



"Yeah, I tried to ask for her help, but she shot out of here. Probably looking for Julia." Rafael replied.



"Well, we will just have to have her take care of it." The old man said.



The old man took Chet's arm.



"What is your name, son?" the old man asked.



"It's Chet," he said.



"And what room number are you in, Mr. Chet?"



"Seventeen." Chet tried to look back at the group of women to confirm that had just happened.



"Well, Mr. Chet. I'll help you down to your room, and then we will send down someone to check in on you. You don't look well, Mr. Chet, and we don't want you to be sick out here." the old man was starting to lead him out.



"It's just Chet," he said



Chet was lead past the group of women on the way out. They were all good looking before, but they all now looked exceptional. The middle-aged woman now looked like she was in her 20's and hair was starting to form op into little cat ears on her head. One woman was beginning to approach about seven feet tall, and breasts were puffing up out of sports bras that had fit just a second ago.



Chet walked to his room in a stupor. He didn't know if the old man walked him all the way back, but he was in his suite before he realized it.



Chet looked around the room. Everything was just the way he had left it, but a sense of vertigo lingered in the room. Chet felt himself standing over the edge of a cliff and wanting to jump off. He could feel the Maelstrom outside. He slowly walked to the window and started to part the curtains.



There was a knock at the door.



Chet yelped.



Julie opened the door.



"Chet, I am sorry I didn't come by last night. I had something come up for work." Julia was out of her work uniform, wearing a sundress that highlighted her breasts magnificently. Her breasts were way under the size they had reached last night, but still very attractive. Her ass was back to its initial size as well.



"I have been looking for you all day." Julia pressed her hand into his chest and swirled her fingers around on it. "I was hoping we could make up for the lost time."



"But I was supposed to wait." Chet was lost. He had seen something in the Maelstrom, and it was all too much.



"Well, now, we can wait together." Julia went over to the door and brought in another woman. She was tall, dark, and beautiful. The new woman had grace and fluidity that were so out of place on a girl that was projecting nervousness. Her face never raised off the ground, and she looked at Chet, but she never looked high enough to get above his shoes. Chet had no problems there.



"This is Shaya. I was talking about you too, her, and she wanted to see you. Now we can all wait together."



Shaya was also wearing a light dress, but hers wasn't as filled out as Julias. Shaya, however, had other great features. She was almost six inches taller than Chet, and she was fit. Her dress hung loosely, but wherever skin showed, there was a restrained strength to Shaya.



While he was looking at Shaya, Julia went in for a kiss. She had rocked up on her toes to come up to Chet's height. She tasted of raspberries, and she felt amazing. Her lips were so soft and so moist that Chet forgot about looking into infinity at the Maelstrom. He melted in her kiss. He hadn't noticed that he was clenching pretty much his whole body until he let go. It was as if he was tensed and ready to run until this moment.



Chet felt a hand grab his chin and lift it up from Julia's. Shays' face was a little bit higher than Chet's. Shaya smelled like coconut oils and honey. Chet breathed in, taking in the combinations of their smells.



Julia pulled at his belt, and he tried to look away from Shaya. She pulled his face back to hers. His pants were pulled off, and he was pulled out of them. Shaya then took him and pushed him back onto the bed.



Time seemed to slow down to Chet. He floated onto the bed, like being pushed through water. Chet felt himself float before his head hit the pillow.



Julia and Shaya were both standing there looking at Chet. He could tell that they knew something he didn't.



"You are just amazing, Chet," Julia said and started to remove her top.



Chet lifted himself up. Julia was starting on her bra when he looked at her. Shaya was starting to drop her pants.



Chet wasn't sure that this is what he needed right now. There was too much going on to do this right now.



"What do you mean by that?" Chet asked.



"By what, Chet?" Shaya asked.



"When Julia said, 'I was amazing.'" Shaya was almost entirely undressed now, with only her black panties left on. She was lithe, and her tight muscles only added to her curves. She had a light six-pack that had been hidden by her top before. Her breast were firm loads on her chest, topped with small brown nipples.



"Does it matter?" Shaya asked.



Shaya lept onto the bed and landed softly next to Chet. She leaned in and kissed him again. She reached down and gripped his cock and simultaneously plunged her tongue into his mouth. Chet moaned.



He was losing his resolve. He needed answers. But he also wanted this to happen. His dick was starting to take over.



Julia was grappling with her bra. Her boobs had started to overflow her cups, and Chet was sure this was causing her trouble.



"Shaya, don't start without me. I need some help with my bra." Julia struggled and tried to maneuver the straining bra into a position where she could reach the hooks.



"With enough determination, one person can accomplish anything." Shaya pulled her panties off with one hand, guiding herself onto Chet's cock. She was large enough to slip right onto him. Shaya was loser than Jula had been, but Shaya moved her hips from side to side when she lowered, and his cock pressed into the walls of her pussy with each thrust.



Shaya reached down and started to pull on his shirt. Chet tried to remove it, but as he shifted his weight, Shaya pulled off his shirt. She pressed into his stomach and ran her hands over his chest while she rode him. Chet noticed less flab in his own chest when she did this.



Julie appeared at Chet's side, her breasts grown massive already, and red marks showing where her bra had pressed on her skin. She bent down and thrust a nipple into his face.



Chet Hesitated.



"Just let go, Chet," Julia said as Shaya started to speed up on top of Chet. "Shut your mind up and just let go."



So he tried. He was split between teasing Julia's nipple, holding off on cumming until Shaya was ready, and the fact that the universe folded upon itself just outside of his window.



Shaya pushed Julia out of the way. She leaned down and looked down into Chet's face.



"Get out of your own head, Chet. I can see you struggle, but just let it go. Cum inside me." Shaya twirled Chet's nipples in her fingers.



Chet arched his back, unable to hold off anymore. He came hard, and his body tensed all the way back up. There was a moment where his entire body turned into one big charlie horse. But then his body relaxed, and he looked up at Shaya and Julia.



Shays's hair was all tied up, but Julies was mostly pulled loose from her ponytail from her earlier struggles. Her hair started to float up in the air. He tried to spin and look at Julita, but nothing was underneath him.



Shaya pulled off of him and kissed him deeply. When she pulled away, Chet could see her drift off into the room, as if there was no gravity. Ironically, the feeling of vertigo had passed. He looked around and saw himself free-floating in the place as well. There was no sensation of this, and he was only able to sense this for a second because Julia had leaped onto him.



"See what I mean, Chet, letting go is so much fun."



She drew him to her and plunged his still tender erection into her. She would have made him cum again if he wasn't going back into his head again.



What was happening? He was drifting off into the room, and there was an expanding woman on top of him. Julia was pressing hard into his chest. He felt her soft tits spread further and further across his chest.



Julia's breasts were covering more of his own chest, but he had also felt he had lost a fair amount of his belly weight. Her nipples rode up and down his much harder chest as she rode him. His mind wasn't allowed to wander, as he was grabbed by the hair and rotated downwards together with Julia.



Shaya was standing on the bed, and now Chet was looking up at her. Shaya had pulled him down to be even with her crotch.



"You don't want to lose focus on me," she said and shoved his face into her spread legs.



Chet licked downwards to find out where precisely he was positioned at and soon found her clit. He worked the sides of her slit, and rapidly his tongue was spread wide and trying to stimulate her opening as well as reaching to lick her clit.



Chet was absorbed in his actions. There was no sense outside of his dick, chest, and mouth. With enthusiasm, he dove into his task and tried to enjoy it. Shaya's juices started to run down his neck and began to drip off of his body. There was very little he could do with Julia, but he gripped into her breasts and started to massage.



Soon, he was as the edge of his restraint. The buildup in his core was too much, and a pulse shot down his legs, he flexed them wide, and let loose with his toe-curling orgasm.



He pushed back from Shaya, and he was drifting away. He had forgotten entirely about the fact that he was floating. There was a moment where Chet forgot everything that was happening, but then he had brought back into it.

Shaya was over seven feet tall. He had thought there was more to her vagina to work. Her breasts rounded out, her ass inflated, and her thighs and legs were almost as wide around as his chest. She was also standing on top of an even larger bed. Chet wasn't sure if he was shrinking or if Shaya and the room were growing. Shaya was standing on the bed, and at her new seven and a half foot height, she still had room to reach her arms up and stretch out. Her breasts were pulled up by the display, and they developed and expanded even more.



Julia was relaxed on Chet. Shaya reached out to Chet and removed Julia from him. Julia drifted down to the bed.



"My turn," Shaya said.



She pulled him up, still floating, and held him in the air near her. Her face was much larger than before, and she kissed him deeply. Chet had never kissed anyone that was this much larger than him, and it was a sensation he could get used to. Shaya's lips larger than his own pulled him into her depths. He was engulfed by Shaya's lips, so he decided to take more control. He dropped his lips slightly and started to suck on her bottom lip.



Shaya pulled him into the kiss further with one hand and started to rock his cock up and down with the other. Julia's and Shaya's combined juices made his cock slick. There was no more illusion of control, Chet was in Shaya's charge now. All he could do was lie back and enjoy the ride.



Shaya was enjoying the control as well because she was growing even more. Her hand started to cover more and more of his dick. Her kisses pulled him in deeper and deeper. Her breasts began to press into his chest, and soon they were pressing into his stomach. She lowered him down and placed him in a position to enter her. He just slid right into her.



"Oh, that's nice," Shaya said, "But it could be better."



Chet wasn't sure what she meant. It wasn't like he could control what was happening to him. All Chet wanted, right now, was to satisfy Shaya. He was trying to flex his cock harder or to push more in-depth, but the end result was the same. His cock was still the same size. Shaya had stopped growing.



Shaya sighed and said. "Just take me."



Chet was pulled against the V shape that Shaya's legs formed now. They clasped together, and her hips were starting to develop a heart-shaped ass. Chet hadn't seen or felt her legs come together, but he saw the room rotate around them, as she softly floated back onto the bed. The world was literally spinning around him now, and through the window, he could see the Maelstrom. It rolled on and on, always there.



Suddenly Julia was there behind him.



"What are you looking at? When you have your penis in a woman, you should be paying attention to her. "Chet looked down at Shaya, and the confidence was gone from her. She had bitten down on her lower lip, unsure of herself.

Chet placed his arms to either side of her stomach and lowered himself into her pussy again. He reached to start thrusting, and when he pushed in, he took her nipple in her mouth. Each time he would thrust down, he would swirl his tongue around her flat, wide nipple. Shaya's head rocked back into the bed.



"Oh my God, Chet. I can feel you growing inside of me!" Shaya moaned.



Chet dropped out of reach of her nipple before he noticed that Shaya was growing again. Her body was elongating and expanding underneath him, lifted into the air by her growing hips. She was forced to arch her back and lift him up in the air. He could now feel his dick catching up to her size, pressing into the sides of her vagina.



Chet was starting to pound harder and harder, but he was having trouble pulling in and out. He was losing his handholds on her sides. Shaya was growing faster now, and he was just unable to thrust his larger cock into her without more purchase. Chet tried to add more movement to his motions but was unable to get leverage.



He moved his arms again to get a better grip, and there was more muscle there than before. He was starting to really bulk up now. He tried to reach out and press his hands into Shaya's skin and press in hard like he was palming a basketball. But he only had enough room to grab the sides of her ass, which had now come to the size of beachballs.



He was able to thrust again, and also add in more circular motions to his thrusts. Shaya's moans and sighs grew louder and louder with each movement. He was disappearing between her thighs, and he took the opportunity to work her clit with his palm as she enlarged, and he thrust. Suddenly, there was an impact of massive breasts into his back. Shaya gasped at the extra force on her g-spot.



Julia had leaped onto his back and was gripping his muscles. Chet hadn't noticed, but his arms and shoulders had bulked up enough for her to grasp in her hands like a rock climber. He hadn't been paying attention to Shaya, and she clamped down on his dick when she orgasmed. She was so slick when she came that Chet shot out of her vagina. He and Julia floated into the air above Shaya. Julia wrapped around him, and she was grinding into his back with her crotch.



Chet's dick was still rock hard and now was high enough to reach past his head. It flared out near the middle and was wide enough where he couldn't get his hands around the narrowest part at the base. It retained the upward curve that he had before, but was absolutely massive now. His balls had grown as well, and were pained, waiting for release.



Julia moved to his front and kissed him deeply.



"Use me," She said.



They floated down to the still quaking Shaya's belly. Julia lifted one leg over his cock and laid down on top of it. Her ass was on display, spread wide by her legs, straddling his cock.



Chet wasn't satisfied with this. He reached down, wrapped his arms around her waist, and lifted. His muscles bludged larger, and he lifted her up. With the added strength and help from his throbbing erection, Chet carried Julia across the belly of Shaya into the under cleavage of Shaya's massive tits.



Chet laid her down and started to rock.



She was leaking so much juice he could feel it lubricating his cock and her body. Julia was expanding again on top of him, her tits and thighs pressing into him. His balls were starting to shiver. When the orgasm wracked his body, his hips thrust upwards, and he was able to lift Julia into the air with his cock alone. He erupted into the air, and his cum shot up onto Shaya's breasts. Ropes of semen flew into the air and landed in an arc away from the two of them. When he came again, his cock flexed backward, and he shot all over Julia's body. Each ejection of cum was more forceful than the last, and each twitch of his manhood cause cum to fly in a new direction.

Before he passed out, he saw an arm the size of a commuter train reach down and wipe up his cum and disappear over the mountainous breasts ahead of them. A low moan caused one final spurt from his deflating cock to drench Julia's body. Chet fell asleep to Shaya, and Julia's satisfied cries.



When Chet woke up, he was being cuddled by Julia and Shaya. They had gone back to their previous sizes, and the room was back to normal. Nothing was out of place, none of the walls had been smashed through, and absolutely nothing was covered in cum. He enjoyed the two women resting on him. He savored Julia lying on top of his right side, with her breasts to either side of his arm. Shaya had her legs wrapped around his left leg, and her head was placed into his shoulder.



There was a knock at the door.



"Mr. Chet?" A female voice asked.



The door opened, and the visitor knocked one more time.



"Are you in here?" Chet could see the woman, Elise, that he had met in the bar earlier.



Chet tried to hide behind the two women he was lying between, but Elise saw the bed and closed the door behind her as she entered the room. She crossed her arms and looked stern and angry.



"Well, I was hoping to talk to you before Julia got here again." He could see her disapproval.

<p>"I think we need to have a chat sooner rather than later, Chet."</p>
<p>"What about?" Chet raised up off of the bed, and Julia moaned slightly, not waking, but missing his contact. </p>
<pre><code>Elise walked over and opened the curtains. The swirling Maelstrom outside of the window still flowed in its eternal swirl. Somehow it was more peaceful for Chet to see it this time. His eyes always seemed to zoom into it, and its spiral overflowed the window that restrained it from coming into the room entirely.



"We should talk about this."
