<li><em>Madam Materia</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Jesse let out a heavy sigh, running her fingers through her pitch-black
hair in the few seconds of relief she was awarded between finishing work
and returning home. She wished she had a cigarette, so badly she wished
it, but had started quitting months ago for her girlfriend's health. The
girl even reflexively fished through her pockets to look for her pack,
as if maybe she might magically find it despite having thrown out her
last so long ago.</p>
<p>The sharp features of her face furrowed, doing her best to fight the
craving along with the frustrations of the rest of her life. "Fuck," she
cussed to herself, distracting her hands by fixing the collar of her
blouse.</p>
<p>She realized she\'d been jittery, leaving her work clothes hanging
awkwardly off her decently kept body. Hard to get fat when you're
constantly on the move, so she was left slim and fit, giving her almost
a hardened look with her steely blue eyes. Eyes that found themselves
wandering, hunting for a distraction for her small moment of respite,
and they found something quite unusual when they did.</p>
<p>There wasn't a door in this alley before, let alone one so old fashioned
against the modern façade of the office building it appeared on. Was she
hallucinating? A closer inspection, stepping up and resting her hand on
the small brass handle, made such an idea very unlikely. Turning the
knob in her fingers the girl pushed her way inside, amazed to see a
sprawling interior of shelves adorned with all variety of odd
knickknacks.</p>
<p>Unable to help her curiosity she continued inside the little shop, just
to have a quick look around before she had to return to her girlfriend
at home. There was a woman wandering about, her back to Jesse as she
awkwardly swept with her elbows all the way out to the sides. Long
golden blonde hair flowed down her back, over the wide swell of her
plush bottom, and down past her knees. Jesse's own dark locks were only
past shoulder length, and that was a pain to keep up, so she could only
imagine how hard it was for the thicker girl to maintain that much hair
and keep it so perfect. It was far from her only surprise though.</p>
<p>"Hello," the guest made a vie to perhaps get some service or information
about this strange place.</p>
<p>The blonde perked up in shock, turning around to reveal her absolutely
monstrous bust. No wonder she was holding the broom so strangely, they
jutted out from her chest by feet, and hung down to her waist in
perfectly rounded teardrops. How she wasn't tumbling down just from
their weight the more lean-cut woman had no idea. Maybe only because of
the size if her rear, balancing her out in an extreme hourglass?</p>
<p>Jesse was staring wide eyed, though the overly curvy woman didn't seem
to mind. She simply gave a small giggle. "Oh, a customer," she chirped,
bouncing on her toes and setting her inhuman proportions into motion.
"Hold on, I\'ll go fetch Madam."</p>
<p>She might as well have said nothing the dark-haired woman was so
distracted. Too busy watching the excitable girl hop off, her tits
swaying and slapping against each other in the confines of her
practically painted on dress as she made her way to the back room.</p>
<p>A moment later she returned with this "Madam". A peculiar redheaded
woman, wearing a gaudy, wide brimmed witch\'s hat that cast most of her
face in shadow. It did nothing to diminish the golden hue of her eyes
however; they shone brightly, seeming to stare right through the guest
to her little shop.</p>
<p>"Hello there, welcome to Madam Materia\'s Magical Menagerie," she
exclaimed proudly, puffing out her chest to show it off. Compared to the
blonde's explosive size she may as well have had mosquito bites, but
that didn't mean the large over-handfuls weren't impressive in their own
right, adding curves to the woman's lithe frame. "I'm the titular Madam
Materia, though Matty is just fine for customers. My associate Alice
tells me I can help you find something?" she gestured to the
hyper-proportioned girl standing next to her, holding her broom
nervously into her bust as if waiting for something.</p>
<p>Jesse raised her hands apologetically. "Oh, sorry uh, Madam Matty. I
wasn't really looking for anything, just kind of browsing."</p>
<p>The redhead gave a giggle, hiding her darkly painted lips with a
delicate hand. "We all have something we\'re wishing for Jesse," she
mused, walking over to the counter of her little store and sitting
herself down. "Sometimes it's as simple as a smoke."</p>
<p>How did she know her name? The smoke the trim girl could play off, there
were enough smokers in the city that was an easy enough assumption to
guess, but her name. "How-"</p>
<p>"The \'magical\' part of that introduction I went through earlier
darling," the witchy Madam finished the thought with a wry smirk.</p>
<p>There wasn't such a thing, there had to be more to it. At the same time
though, this was an old-fashioned storefront somehow taking up the first
floor of an office building. "Okay so, assuming that I believe you,
what's your deal then?" the black-haired woman questioned, letting her
blue eyes linger on the woman suspiciously.</p>
<p>"Like I said, we all have something we\'re wishing for," Matty replied
with a coy smile, letting her golden gaze drift lovingly to her
hyper-sized employee. "Mortals don't find the Menagerie unless there's
something they need that, quote unquote, <em>real life</em> fails to provide
them."</p>
<p>That last bit struck a chord, "providing"; it was the whole reason Jesse
wanted that smoke in the first place. It felt like that was all her life
was anymore, going to work to make a living, them coming home to take
care of her girlfriend, Eve. There was no time for herself, it was just
work and Eve.</p>
<p>It wasn't that she didn't still love the girl. They had started off as
friends in high school, both playing that same game all gay teens did:
pretending your hardest to be straight. Neither really needed more
excuse to be labeled as outcasts. Jesse had been the typical rebel,
taking up smoking and secluding herself from everyone to protect
herself, and Eve was prone to illness. She had a chronic condition that
could have her suddenly sick, and needing go home for the rest of the
day. Nobody wanted to hang out with "the sick girl" for all the stigma,
nobody but the dark-haired loner girl. Maybe because, even back then,
they could just tell they were lesbians?</p>
<p>They ended up coming out to one another in senior year, both intending
to at the same time no less, leading to a cute and awkward exchange that
sealed the deal for them as a couple. The pair moved in together as soon
as they could, to get away from the scrutinising eyes of their parents,
and things seemed good; for a while anyways. They both had jobs until
Eve\'s condition started to worsen, then she was forced to quit, leaving
Jesse to take the full burden of supporting their situation.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, it had drained her, leaving the working woman
resentful of her partner. Resentful she had to quit smoking, that she
had to constantly work, and do the shopping, and make dinner. She still
loved her, but sometimes she just wished maybe she wasn't always the one
taking care of her; that the tables could be turned and maybe she could
be the one to lay down and be taken care of for a bit.</p>
<p>"Ali, why don't you give our fine guest a little shoulder rub?" the
redhead ordered more than suggested. "There's a lot bothering her."</p>
<p>The blue-eyed woman perked nervously. "W-what?" she stammered.</p>
<p>"Yes Madam," the buxom blonde chirped, setting her broom against the
wall and skipping over to comply with her boss' wishes.</p>
<p>Redness filled Jesse\'s face, feeling those soft, squishy breasts
pressing into her back. Alice's hands reached over her orbs to take hold
of their guest's shoulders, and with expert grace in her dexterous
hands, she started to knead away the knots and tension.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the gaudy shopkeeper got to her feet, walking by with clacks
of her spatted heels against the hard floor as she examined the shelves.
"Now then, what best to help you with your little problem?" she mused,
running her fingers along the items she kept on display.</p>
<p>"I didn't-" the slim girl started to reply, only to have her buxom
masseuse pull her a little tighter into her cleavage and sink her digits
deep enough to make her moan.</p>
<p>Matty gave a playful little laugh. "You didn't have to. Magical,
remember?" she teased, perking up and plucking a small box off the
shelf. "Here we are," the witch skipped back to her customer and held
out the item for her.</p>
<p>The busty blonde stepped back, letting the befuddled woman focus once
more and take the offered object. It was like she couldn't help herself,
the same curiosity that had pulled her into this strange place now had
her peeking under the lid. She was slow opening it, only a sliver to see
inside, and found a simple looking metal bracelet within; the kind of
thing getting peddled in shams all over the web for "wellness".</p>
<p>A smile cracked the guest\'s lips, and she couldn't help breaking into a
hearty cackle. "Oh my god, you can't be serious?" she rubbed the
beginnings of tears out of her eyes, turning them to the charlatan. "I
knew this was all some sort of con."</p>
<p>The redhead was unfazed, a grin spreading across her face in reply.
"Assuming it was a con, how would I know that your girlfriend back home
was the type of person that might be the target for one of fake
\'cures\'," she countered, regurgitating one of the girl\'s statements
from earlier.</p>
<p>Once more a chill went up Jesse's spine. The question was already
running through her head of "how", and she already knew the answer. The
tricky woman was already mouthing it as she was having the thought:
magical.</p>
<p>Swallowing thickly, she looked back down at the simple, silver trinket.
"So, what do I do with it?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Just give it to your lover," Matty answered, beckoning her curvy
associate over with her hand and tickling the blonde under the chin. "It
should take care of the issue, make her a bit more dependable. Like
Alice here."</p>
<p>Again, the guest was staring, inciting a small giggle from the
hyper-proportioned girl that made her blush. More like Alice? She could
still vividly remember that shoulder rub from earlier, making her flush
further with a shameless arousal.</p>
<p>Magic, she said? What was there to lose? "Alright," she relented,
letting a small amount of something fill her. Maybe it was hope for a
solution? Or perhaps something darker, a little more selfish in her
desire for Eve to be better. "How much?"</p>
<p>The witch simply waved a hand. "We don't take money here," she answered
with that same grin on her lips. "Seeing the results of my work is
reward enough."</p>
<p>Whatever feeling it was inside her, it stayed with Jesse the drive home.
She wasn't dreading it for once. Able to wear a, potentially malice,
smile as she pulled down into the underground parking for their
apartment building.</p>
<p>After what felt like the longest ride she'd ever taken on an elevator,
the dark-haired woman arrived on their floor; wasting no time stepping
out and down the hall to their little home. The telltale rattling of her
keys would announce her presence, so opening the door Eve was already
sitting up, waiting from her place on the couch. "Hey Jazz," she greeted
her lover with a warm smile.</p>
<p>"Hey Eve," the sharp-featured woman replied with a bit more pep than she
had the past few weeks, leaving her girlfriend to smile brighter.</p>
<p>It was clear just from looking at her that Eve was in a rough spot. She
was thin, bordering on gaunt, a fact most visible in her pale cheeks and
her wrists. Her auburn hair was currently messy, falling over her
shoulders in frizzy waves down to her small chest, and framing her
freckled face. Regardless of her illness however, her light-green eyes
kept fiercely determined. She wasn't going to give up while she had
Jesse.</p>
<p>"You seem pretty happy, was it a good day at work?" the bedridden girl
asked, shifting to make room for her partner on the sofa.</p>
<p>Jesse took the invitation, settling down into the offered space and
getting comfortable. "Something like that," she replied, fetching the
small box the Madam had given her from her pocket. "I got you a little
something."</p>
<p>The sick girl perked up a bit. "Been a while since we did anything like
gifts," she noted, accepting the tiny package. "What's the occasion?"</p>
<p>With a smile and a nonchalant shrug, the woman met her girl\'s eyes.
"None really. Just got thinking of you," she offered.</p>
<p>Blushing the pale girl turned away. "You didn't have to," she muttered
shyly, but was still clearly excited for the gift. Opening it up she had
a similar reaction to her girlfriend, pulling out the simple little
bracelet with a laugh. "Oh Jazz, you didn't get swindled by something
like this. You're smarter than that," she teased.</p>
<p>"I thought it would look cute on you," it wasn't entirely a lie, the
little silver piece was elegant in its plainness. "If it helps you feel
better at all then hey, just a cool bonus."</p>
<p>The red in Eve\'s cheeks deepened. "Thank you love," she leaned forward,
pressing a kiss to her partner's lips. "That's so much better now that
you don't taste like cigarettes," she joked, and without further
dawdling slipped the trinket over her wrist.</p>
<p>For a brief moment the fit girl\'s steely blues went wide. She felt her
heart quicken, waiting for the "magic" to happen on the edge of her
seat. Waiting for it, only for nothing to happen.</p>
<p>The auburn-haired girl watched her curiously. "Everything okay Jazz?"</p>
<p>It took a moment for her to snap out of it, the eager anticipation
she\'d had immediately dashed with a pessimistic emptiness. Why would
she have expected anything to happen? "Yeah, it's fine," she sank back
into the couch, holding back a sigh.</p>
<p>All positivity was drained from the room, lowering both their moods as
Eve\'s slender shoulders sank. "Okay," she didn't press, going quiet.</p>
<p>The dark-haired woman rose back up, wandering away without even looking
at her partner again. "I'm gonna go get changed."</p>
<p>"Okay," her lover repeated solemnly.</p>
<p>It was a usual rest of the night. Jesse\'s foul mood left her mostly
keeping to herself. Eve suggested a movie, but the brooding woman
rejected it with a simple "I'm not in the mood," so they had a quiet
dinner at the couch, and went to bed.</p>
<p>The same thought pestered her all night. Why the hell did she trust that
witch? Why did she let herself, for a moment, be open to her bullshit?
She slept restlessly, her back turned to her partner until the early
hours of the morning.</p>
<p>When she woke the auburn-haired girl was missing from the sheets,
something that never happened. Immediately the trim girl jumped to
worry. "Eve?" she called out softly, pushing herself out of bed in just
her underwear.</p>
<p>There was no immediate answer, but as Jesse stepped out of their room,
she heard something. Something was sizzling. Like a reflex she scented
the air, proving her other sense correct that something was cooking.
Following the trail, she wandered through their little one bedroom into
their kitchen, caught by surprise when she saw her sick girlfriend up
and about.</p>
<p>"Oh, morning Jazz, I didn't hear you get up," the pale girl chirped with
a soft smile.</p>
<p>Her blue eyes scanned the scene, catching sight of some slightly browned
scrambled eggs being stirred in their largest pan. "What're you...?" she
couldn't even complete the thought she was so stunned.</p>
<p>Eve gave the eggs a dexterous flip, her new bracelet rattling around on
her thin wrist. "You seemed upset last night," she explained calmly. "I
was feeling pretty good this morning so I figured maybe I could make you
breakfast to cheer you up."</p>
<p>And the surprises just kept on coming. The girl hadn't been well enough
to do any cooking for... god, her Jesse couldn't even remember. "Um,
thanks," was all the pitch-haired woman was able to get out of her
mouth.</p>
<p>The normally sick girl just smiled warmly, plating up a hearty meal for
her partner. "I hope you like it."</p>
<p>Jesse was still collecting herself from the situation, taking the hot
plate in her hands and staring into it for a moment. The creamy scent of
the eggs wafted up into her face, making her mouth water in
anticipation. It was going to be good, but she was still struggling with
the "how" aspect that all this had happened.</p>
<p>"You should probably eat it before it gets cold," her green-eyed
companion noted in tease. "I can't take care of your work for you."</p>
<p>Just that choice of words reminded the woman of everything, sparking her
to realization. That stupid wrist band, it had actually worked!</p>
<p>A grin crossed her lips, and she placed a kiss on her lover\'s cheek as
she passed her for the kitchen table. "Right," the working girl chirped
giddily.</p>
<p>The positive change had Eve beaming along with her, affectionately
running her slender fingers over the spot her partner's lips had touched
down. It was good to see her happy, and while the chronically ill wasn't
going to hold out hope she\'d stay feeling good all day, she was
certainly going to do her best with the time they had. Scooping up her
own meal she came over to the table, pulling up a seat so they could eat
together.</p>
<p>Despite the gesture however, Jesse's mind was elsewhere. Taking the
cooking away from her responsibilities was a great thing, her girlfriend
actually doing even a bit better was a great thing. How far would it go
though? She was already hopefully imagining that the two of them might
manage to have a little "fun" tonight.</p>
<p>Said thoughts lingered in her head through breakfast, until eventually
the auburn-haired girl had to remind her. "You're going to be late for
work Jazz."</p>
<p>"Right," her excited lover got to her feet, laying another kiss upon the
girl's cheek. "I'll see you tonight!"</p>
<p>The enthusiasm was infectious. How long had it been since the two had
worn such smiles? "See you then," the thin girl replied, a tint in her
cheeks from the repeated shows of affection.</p>
<p>Hastily dressing, Jesse parted for work, leaving Eve alone in their
little apartment for the day. It was almost instinctive to want to curl
up into her little nest on the couch and watch television, but she felt
good for the first time in what felt like forever. She was up, and she
wanted to do things.</p>
<p>Over the course of the morning she did the dishes from breakfast, dusted
off their shelves and tables, vacuumed, mopped. The auburn-haired girl
was so full of energy the place was spotless before lunch, and still she
found herself restless. Where was it all coming from?</p>
<p>In the end did it matter? She was feeling better; better enough it
seemed like a right time to do a weigh in. If this lasted, it would be
good to track her health progress for her doctor.</p>
<p>Stepping into the bathroom the skinny girl climbed up onto the scale,
not particularly hopeful, but still eager to get a result. As she looked
down though she was left in shock.</p>
<p>"Four pounds?" she knelt down to read it closer, just to make sure her
eyes weren't playing tricks on her.</p>
<p>No, it wasn't her eyes. According to the scale, she\'d put on four
pounds since she last remembered weighing herself. That felt...
impossible. It had been a while since her last weigh in, but she\'d been
sick and eating like a bird most of that time, she should have lost
weight. Stripping to double check it wasn't her clothes or something she
got a look at herself. Still thin and bony from illness, but there was
the lightest bit of fat back on her. She could reach up and take hold of
the squishy little mounds of her breasts; she actually had breasts
again.</p>
<p>Without realizing, and with a smile on her face, she lost a solid minute
to playing with herself. Well, who was she to look a gift horse in the
mouth? It was a good thing she\'d gained some weight back. Maybe it's
why she was feeling so peppy? Or maybe, her green eyes drifted to the
little bauble rolling around her wrist, this had something to do with
it?</p>
<p>Whatever it was, luck or a turning of the tides, it was a small
blessing. Reminding herself not to work to burnout Eve made herself a
nice hearty lunch with what little they had. Maybe she should text her
girlfriend to pick some things up on her way home? Tempting as it was to
try and go herself, she didn't really have anything fresh to wear; plus,
she wasn't one hundred percent sure about their finances at the moment.</p>
<p>She could fix the first problem though. Shooting off a text to her
dark-haired princess to get some things on the way home, she started
collecting up all their dirty laundry for a load.</p>
<p>Sitting at her desk, Jesse's mind was anywhere but at work. She actually
wanted to go home; a fresh feeling that left her positively giddy. When
she got her girlfriend's text it shook her back to her senses, for a
moment at least. The sick girl hadn't texted her at work since she\'d
been laid off, giving even so simple a request as for her to pick up
some things for dinner leaving her nostalgic.</p>
<p>Things were on the upswing, and it carried the working girl through her
day. During the drive home she found herself idly drumming on her
steering wheel, so busy dreaming of what they were going to do tonight
she almost forgot to get the groceries. Eve hadn't really given her a
specific list, so she was left texting back to ask what the girl wanted
her to get.</p>
<p><em>"Whatever you\'d like hun,"</em> her partner\'s text came back quickly.
<em>"I\'ll make it work, just hurry home!"</em></p>
<p>Excitement was back tingling through her. The sharp-featured woman was
getting the full treatment, whatever she wanted, and her lover was eager
to have her home. Maybe the homebound girl's thoughts over the day had
been similar to her own?</p>
<p>Who was Jesse to keep her waiting? She got the shopping done in record
time, and headed back to their apartment laden with bags. As if she knew
her girlfriend had arrived the auburn-haired girl was waiting for her in
the hall.</p>
<p>"Here, let me take those," Eve offered, as she scooped everything off
the fit woman's arms.</p>
<p>It had only been a day and you could see the difference in the girl. She
was up, she\'d taken the time and effort to be dressed, and the wavy
tangles of her hair from laying down all day were all but gone. Looking
her over, she was as beautiful as the days they\'d first met in high
school; maybe a little more?</p>
<p>As both stood tall, Jesse found steel blue eyes were level with her
partner's forehead. Maybe it was just she hadn't seen the sick girl
standing in a long time, but she didn't remember her being this tall.
Normally above those reddish locks were just under her nose, leaving her
able to smell her shampoo and hug her into her chest.</p>
<p>The pair ended up just standing in the hall, until Eve tilted her head
at her lover's confused staring. "Everything alright Jazz?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, fine," the dark-haired woman replied, returning to a smile. What
did a small detail like that matter? "Shall we get inside?" she took her
girlfriend by the elbow, causing her to flush as they walked arm in arm
back to the apartment.</p>
<p>The couple unpacked everything together, Jesse openly making grabs at
the green-eyed beauty. Cupping her rear, making her squeak, and even
finding a moment to pull her into her arms and make out with her. The
fervent kiss was met with a small moan from the shorter girl, as their
tongues danced, and their hands roamed each other's bodies.</p>
<p>In the brief moment of a pause between their passions, the auburn-haired
girl got a chuckle in. "Someone's excited," she teased with that bright,
optimistic beam on her face.</p>
<p>"Hard not to be," her girlfriend purred in reply, bringing her lips back
to her lover\'s mouth. "How about we slip into the bedroom before you
start dinner?"</p>
<p>A tempting offer, one that had the pale girl's cheeks turning pink. "It
has been a while," she noted, breaking their embrace and pulling Jesse
along with her towards the bedroom.</p>
<p>And just like that, there was no more room for words. The two girls
passed through the doorway, picking up where their kissing left off.
Their hands leapt onto one another, blindly slipping into each other's
clothing to start undressing, as they stumbled towards the bed. The
working girl won the race, getting her partner's top off over her head
first, breaking their snogging long enough to toss the offending garment
to the edge of the room before getting back to their impassioned
smooching.</p>
<p>Side by side they tumbled into the sheets, both knowing where they
wanted to be and scrambling to kick off the rest of what they were
wearing. They stayed on top of the blankets, pausing a moment to admire
one another before they got lost in the heat again. Eve was more
stunning than Jesse had seen her in a long time. She had a glow about
her, and her lover's steel-blue eyes were drawn to the curves adorning
her lithe frame. They were a delicate touch, a light brushing of
femininity on the thin woman's frame, and they were perfect. Her
work-hardened hands ran over them, brushing up the beautiful girl\'s
thigh, over the light swell of her hip, then down the valley of her
curved waist to end on one of those perky little mounds.</p>
<p>"So, you noticed too?" the reddish-haired girl teased, scooting herself
closer to invite more of her partner's touch. "My weight\'s gone back up
a little."</p>
<p>"In all the right places," the trim woman replied, giving the breast
beneath her fingers a squeeze.</p>
<p>A shy flush tinted the girl's cheeks, and she immediately jumped back
into the making out. Instinct took her girlfriend, the dark-haired lover
starting to guide them down to the bed before she was stopped.
Everything paused, worry filling her sharp features. "What's wrong?"</p>
<p>Eve\'s blush deepened. "Maybe, I could be on top this time?" she
suggested nervously.</p>
<p>That was new, leaving Jesse to process the request before answering with
an enthusiastic "Sure," and a wide grin.</p>
<p>With her condition, the green-eyed beauty had always had to be a bit of
a pillow princess. To have the roles reversed, have her be the one
giving, there wasn't any reason to argue. It was clear the girl was a
little green, following what she remembered her partner doing more than
anything. She guided her pitch-haired princess to the sheets, laying her
out and taking a moment to crawl herself into position.</p>
<p>"Just, let me know if I do something wrong?" she requested of the more
experienced woman.</p>
<p>Flashing a smile with her steel-blue eyes, Jesse put her at ease.
"You'll do fine hun, just be careful with your teeth," she instructed.</p>
<p>The girl took it to heart, wiggling to get comfortable and then dipping
down to slip her tongue between her companion\'s simmering lips. It was
ecstasy, the dark-haired woman\'s eyes closing to savour the feeling as
she let out a loving moan. Her toes curled, her hands looking to find
purchase where they could let out some of the euphoric heat coursing
through her. One took hold of the headboard, knuckles going white as her
clit was tickled by her girlfriend's nose, the other reached down to run
her fingers through those woody locks.</p>
<p>At the touch, those light-green eyes peeked up, the girl's mouth not
stopping its work as she drank in the look on her partner's face. It
brought a smile to her thin lips, hidden between her lover's legs, and
she doubled down on her amateur efforts to please, to keep her feeling
this way. The attempt was rewarded.</p>
<p>Jesse let out another gasping moan, the hand in her happy cunt muncher's
hair pressing her in ever so gently. She'd always been delicate with her
Eve, just because she was on the bottom this time didn't mean that was
going to change. Just that little extra pressure had the girl's chin
rubbing up on her, spreading the lower part of her hot box and letting
her feel all the more stimulation.</p>
<p>"Fuck," she cussed in a soft murmur, drawing those pale-green eyes up to
her once more. "This is-" she couldn't even finish, cut off by a
delighted shudder as things went on.</p>
<p>She was close, her fingers curling in her girlfriend's locks to hold her
in. Attempts at words only came out as lewd, babbling moans. Her hips
were bucking, trying to get the most out of every little lick and
nuzzle. Then, finally, there was a brief moment where everything went
blank, and with a bright flash the toned woman arched and came hard.</p>
<p>The auburn-haired girl kept in place, letting her lover ride out her
climax until the grip on her head lessened. When she finally rose the
whole bottom of her face was coated in a slick sheen of girl cum, adding
a lewd cuteness to her pleased grin. "Was that good?" she asked, already
making her way up to cuddle in the afterglow.</p>
<p>Arms wrapping around the girl, Jesse pulled her close, pressing a kiss
to her forehead. "It was amazing Eve," she cooed, smiling ear to ear.
Just one day and all this! Breakfast, dinner, sex, plus the place was
spotless. Things had turned around drastically; like magic.</p>
<p>Idly her fingers toyed with her girlfriend's bracelet. It was all thanks
to this little trinket. "Up for another round? After dinner of course,"
the sharp-featured woman asked.</p>
<p>Eve met her with a smile. "I might be," she answered coyly.</p>
<p>After such an active night prior, Eve ended up sleeping in, and missing
sending her partner off to work; something she sent an apologetic text
for when she did finally manage to pull herself out of bed. Getting to
her feet was arduous, leaving her stumbling a few steps on her toes
until she could brace herself on the wall. Was she dizzy? Getting sick
again?</p>
<p>Once her gaze drifted down she got a proper answer to the issue. Her
green eyes went wide, catching sight of her body and being left confused
at everything she was seeing. Her boobs were taking up a portion of her
vision, hanging heavy off her body and trying to pull her to the ground
with their unfamiliar weight.</p>
<p>Purely reflexively the girl straightened, feeling that dizziness return,
and still drinking herself in, she could see why. The floor was further
away than usual, not that it was easy to see past her tits. Her hands
were already on those hefty globes, cupping them and feeling them flow
over the edges of her hands. They were huge! Like what you\'d catch on
some heavily edited social media model.</p>
<p>How though? She'd eaten a lot yesterday, much more than normal, but this
kind of overnight change? And the new height perspective. Eve rushed to
the get to the scale, stopping dead once she caught sight of herself in
the bathroom mirror along the way.</p>
<p>She was gorgeous. If yesterday had been an improvement, today you
wouldn't even recognize her as the same girl. Her auburn hair was
healthy, and shiny, the gauntness in her cheeks was all but gone,
leaving her with a youthful plumpness, and her body. She was still
wearing her pyjamas, but they hardly fit. Her top was stretched across
her bust, and the hem was riding up her midriff to show off her slim
waist. The bottoms that last night had fit her snuggly were now riding
high over her wide hips and juicy rear, with the cuffs stretching up her
calves.</p>
<p>Worry flit through her head, for a very brief moment. Then, she wondered
why she should be? She felt great, she looked healthier than ever, and
she didn't have any doubt after last night that Jesse would adore a
little more of her to enjoy.</p>
<p>The buxom beauty had come in here to check her weight progress, so
stepped up onto the scale to check the damage. She had to pull her new
boobs out of her way to see, but when she did her jaw almost hit the
floor.</p>
<p>"Twenty pounds?" it just wasn't possible, but she couldn't deny what
she\'d seen in the mirror. She had to be a full foot taller than she
remembered, and put on some serious curves. Twenty might even be low!</p>
<p>Bending down, her breasts squishing into her knees, she heard her top
creaking. That wasn't good. She'd need a whole new wardrobe for her new
proportions, and with Jazz being the only working one in the house how
would they afford it?</p>
<p>Maybe it was time to try and get back to work? Drifting out to the
living room she pulled out her laptop, dusted off her go-to text editor,
and started whipping up a resume.</p>
<p>Driving home Jesse shot a text her girlfriend's way, hoping to set the
mood for another fun evening. Unlike yesterday however, there wasn't an
immediate reply.</p>
<p>The fit girl couldn't help a small level of concern. She hadn't checked
up on Eve that morning, having woken too late and needed to rush to
work. Could she be mad? Or worse, could whatever spell had given her all
that energy yesterday have worn off, and she was in bed sick again?</p>
<p>When she arrived home the dark-haired woman's worries grew. She flung
open the door to find the apartment empty, her partner's blankets folded
and laying over the back of the couch, and a note waiting for her on the
table. Jesse didn't even get her shoes off, rushing in to get it and
fearing the worst, that perhaps her lover had just left her.</p>
<p><em>"Hey Jazz! Just leaving this as a precaution,"</em> it read. <em>"I had to go
out and do a little shopping, sorry about the bill, but I\'ll be able to
cover it in a couple weeks! I managed to get a new job! Nothing major,
just waiting tables at a little place. I should be home soon, but just
in case I made extra lunch and left it in the fridge for you. With love,
Eve."</em></p>
<p>A wave of relief washed over the woman, one hand clutching at her still
hammering heart. A job. That was even more improvement, and could even
let Jesse take fewer shifts herself. The bill part though? She opened up
her phone, flipping to her banking app and going pale. Eve had spent
hundreds! On what? She'd never been one for just binge shopping out of
nowhere.</p>
<p>So much for cutting out a few work hours; until their safety net was
back there\'d be no rest. She'd have to talk to her girlfriend when she
got home. For now, some home-made food would help her relax.</p>
<p>It was a good hour later, the majority of the pitch-haired woman\'s
frustration having petered away, when the rustling of keys announced her
girlfriend's arrival. The fit woman was lounging on the couch, a show on
and the empty container from her dinner sitting on the table, but bolted
up when she remembered they had things to talk about. Her steel-blue
eyes waited on the door, trying to find the right expression between
upset and understanding.</p>
<p>All of that effort went right out the window as Eve walked through the
door. Fresh heels clicked against the tile to carry her inside, her
heavy body bouncing in the tight confines of her new work uniform.
"Sorry I was gone Jazz," she immediately apologized, flashing a perfect
smile to her lover. "I had to stay a little late, and then transit was
behind schedule..."</p>
<p>Her girlfriend was hardly listening, trying to process the sight of her
buxom beau. She was like a supermodel, squeezed into a slightly too
small waitress costume. Her breasts were huge, forcing small openings in
between the buttons, and her skirt was so short Jesse could see the
lower curve of her rear beneath it. Was this girl even her Eve?</p>
<p>"Tips were amazing though! I pretty much made back most of my wardrobe
costs in just one day," the auburn beauty continued on, fishing into her
apron and hauling out a thick roll of bills.</p>
<p>Jesse shook herself to her senses. "Yeah," she responded blankly, hoping
that was an appropriate answer for whatever her companion had been
talking about.</p>
<p>With a giggle the waitress kicked off her shoes, striding across the
room on her long legs and plopping herself down next to her lover.
"Noticed have you?" she purred.</p>
<p>Even seated, the curvy girl was nearly a head taller than her
dark-haired princess, her knees hanging over the edge of the couch,
practically nudging the table, a good sign she\'d make up the difference
on her feet. "Yeah," the now shorter woman repeated, drinking in every
inch of the bombshell.</p>
<p>Those green eyes sparkled, and their owner leaned down to pull her
partner into a kiss. She was in control, that same girl who last night
wanted to top, and it showed in small ways. One hand slipped onto her
lover\'s lap, the other cupping her cheek to keep her where the beauty
wanted her. Their distance was quickly closed, letting their bodies
press against one another through all their layers while they savoured
the taste of each others' kiss.</p>
<p>With the fires stoked Eve got up, and without a word pulled Jesse along
with her. She started for the bedroom, her finely built girlfriend
offering no objections, and soon things escalated to open groping and
fondling of one another. Clothes hit the floor, and the auburn Venus was
laid out bare atop the sheets with an inviting smile.</p>
<p>The pitch-haired woman complied, crawling up and letting her fingers
roam over the enhanced form of her Eve. "Yes, touch me more Jazz," the
buxom woman pleaded, stretching her body out for her.</p>
<p>Like she would ever deny such a request. Closing her steel-blue eyes she
explored every new curve of her partner. She laid kisses upon that pale,
perfect skin, making her way up from hip, to waist, to the bounty of
those fat tits that now adorned her chest. Even compared to the
sharp-featured girl's lips they were soft, relenting under the tiniest
pressure as the woman blindly toyed with them. They felt large as her
face, squishing around her cheeks as she nuzzled into them with horny
desire.</p>
<p>All the while the big girl cooed, breaking into a high-pitched gasp when
her lover discovered one of her eager nipples. The attention had caused
them to grow hard, as big round as a fingertip and prodding into her
girlfriend's angular face whenever she got close; beckoning her towards
them to lavish them as she was the rest of her body.</p>
<p>When those lips finally wrapped around her needy bud Eve had to hold
back a moan, the pent up energy traveling down her body to force her
legs to grind together. "They're tender," she whimpered under her
breath, resting a hand in those dark locks to hold her partner in place.</p>
<p>The fierce woman couldn't ask for better encouragement. Opening her
mouth, she ran her tongue over the sensitive nub. A hand came up,
sinking her strong fingers into that pliant titty and kneading it
lovingly while she suckled its teat with abandon.</p>
<p>It was a strange sensation to be the shorter of them. She had a breast
in her mouth, and yet her girlfriend's simmering groin was hovering
right at her hips; like an open invitation. Her free hand glided up one
of those thick thighs, eliciting a gasp from the squirming beauty as it
grew close to her hot box. Jesse's thumb lightly grazed those velvety
lips, feeling the way the tall girl shuddered in delight at the whole of
her body being worshipped. The light graze quickly became penetration,
as the dark-haired top let two keyboard-calloused fingers delve into her
larger than life girl's hot depths.</p>
<p>With a sharp moan the curvy woman bucked, unable to form eligible words
for her pleasure. Her arms came down, wrapping around her girlfriend's
back and holding her to her larger form.</p>
<p>"Close," the auburn lover managed to babble out through her ecstasy, as
the bed creaked beneath them and their increasingly frantic lovemaking.</p>
<p>That was the only warning she gave, before she hugged her partner
tightly into her body and came hard for her. They stayed like that for a
moment, Eve locked in bliss as she rode out the high, with Jesse
squeezed into her bosom. Then the pair relaxed, the sharp-featured teat
sucker rising up with a lewd grin. "Have fun?" she teased, moving into a
snug little cuddled position at the nape of her girlfriend's neck.</p>
<p>"Yes," the green eyed beauty smiled down at her. "Ready for your turn
Jazz?"</p>
<p>The smirk on the tall girl\'s face wasn't one that was going to take a
no. Not that her pitch-haired lover was going to turn her down. "Hell
yeah," she replied eagerly.</p>
<p>After their dinner together, and a round three before bed, the two girls
passed out practically as soon as they hit the sheets. Another long
night, and another sound sleep in each other's arms; even as things
continued to change in drastic ways.</p>
<p>Once again it was Jesse that woke first, and as her steel-blue eyes
slowly opened she could already tell something was wrong. She was right
next to Eve, huddled tightly to her lover\'s body, not by either of
their grip, but purely by gravity. It was like she was on a hill, or
falling into a pit towards her girlfriend, making even pushing herself
up into a seated position a chore. When she did however, her eyes flew
wide in surprise.</p>
<p>"Eve," she pushed on her partner to rouse her. "Eve!"</p>
<p>Hesitantly the girl's pale-green eyes opened, heavy with sleep as she
took her dark-haired lover in. "What is it Jazz?" she asked, sitting up
herself.</p>
<p>Her answer came in the way the bed groaned in protest over so light a
movement. Her head rose up, and up, towering more than a foot over her
bedmate, and breasts larger than her head, bigger than Jesse's whole
torso, rolled into place around her chest to fall and hang just over her
navel. The gigantic girl couldn't help looking down with shock, seeing
her body, seeing the way her pyjamas were in tattered shambles. Her legs
had grown past the footboard as she slept, and were now hanging freely
in the air, her toes wiggling freely.</p>
<p>For the first time since all this started, Jesse was truly worried for
her lover. "Something's wrong," she told her, resting her hands on one
of the girl\'s long arms.</p>
<p>The auburn-haired Amazon couldn't be further from that idea. There was a
grin on her plush lips, as her hands busily went about exploring all the
new her there was to explore. "There is?" she asked, not even looking
towards her partner she was so busy fondling herself.</p>
<p>The woman could hardly believe what she was hearing. "Yes," she
practically shouted. "Look at you, this isn't normal," no, it was magic.
That bauble was still hanging over the huge girl\'s wrist, quite tight
now that its owner was nearly double in size.</p>
<p>"When have things been <em>normal</em> with me Jazz?" Eve simply joked,
shifting to lay on her side and show off. "I feel better than I\'ve ever
been! If it means a little growth spurt, some more of me to love," she
teased, arching her enormous chest into her partner, the girl going
flush as she was practically covered in soft breast, "then all's good,
right?"</p>
<p>How was she supposed to respond to that? Admit that she'd accepted some
hex from a witch that was turning her girlfriend into some overstuff
giantess? Even if it was the truth, just running the idea through her
head had the dark-haired woman acknowledging how insane it sounded.
Maybe there was a way to stop it?</p>
<p>"Right," she murmured her reply, buried in her lover's oversized
cleavage.</p>
<p>With a smile the Amazonian beauty offered her lover a peck on the
forehead. "If it's really bothering, I\'ll stop in at the doctor's after
work," she promised, releasing her princess and finally getting out of
bed. On her feet she nearly hit the ceiling, a simple stretch of her
arms knocking loose flakes of the stucco with her elbows.</p>
<p>Jesse shot upright, unable to deny her attraction to the perfect
hourglass her girlfriend demonstrated from behind. "You're still going
to work?" she questioned, hoping the problem of having something to wear
would be obvious. There was no way the curved goddess was fitting into
yesterday's work uniform.</p>
<p>"Of course," the huge girl didn't even hesitate, coming up with a
temporary plan and stealing their topmost sheet to wrap around herself.
"I'm scheduled after all. I'll just pick up a new uniform on the way to
work."</p>
<p>With her size, and proportions, that wasn't going to be a simple trip to
the mall. She'd need custom tailoring, and that could take hours. Not to
mention the cost of something like that. Eve didn't seem particularly
discouraged by any of those factors however.</p>
<p>The trim woman needed something, any sort of idea to try and fix what
she'd done, and as her gaze settled across her girlfriend's form, there
was only one thing she could hope for. "Your bracelet\'s looking snug,"
she commented. "How about I take it in and see about having it resized
for you?" It was lies within lies, but that thing had started all this,
maybe taking it away would solve it.</p>
<p>"I can do it," Eve was quick to reply, almost defensively covering the
little accessory with her hand.</p>
<p>"You're already going to be getting new clothes, working the day, and
visiting the doc's," the dark-haired woman pointed out, counting it all
out on her fingers before doubling down on her façade. "Plus, I bought
it remember? How would you take it back to the right place?"</p>
<p>There was logic to that the bigger girl couldn't really deny. "You could
tell me," she suggested, only to get a disbelieving look from her lover.
Reluctantly the woody-haired beauty caved, fidgeting with the clasp to
remove it. "Alright Jazz."</p>
<p>She returned the silver piece, already missing it upon her wrist as
Jesse put it to the side for later. "Try and get it done for today?" the
curvy giantess pleaded nervously.</p>
<p>"Sure," the sharp-featured woman replied curtly, her mind elsewhere as
she plotted what she was going to do.</p>
<p>There wasn't more time to drive in her request, the blanket-wrapped
woman needed to get going for work. She offered her partner a quick kiss
before scurrying off to do what she needed to be ready.</p>
<p>Calling in sick took a surprising amount of effort from the working
woman. She hadn't been able to in so long, having to support Eve and
herself, it was a strange mixture of anxiety followed by elation when
she was allowed to. It was only too bad she couldn't really enjoy it.</p>
<p>While she\'d been able to call in, that didn't mean she could just
relax. She had to figure out what to do with this cursed silver band,
and the first place she could think to go for answers was where she got
it; Madam Materia. That unfortunately meant going to the alley next to
her office, and if she was caught there, she could very well be fired
for feigning illness. There were more important things to worry about
though than a stupid job.</p>
<p>Making sure to keep to the blind spots of the building's windows, and
dressing as inconspicuously as she could, in one of her girlfriend's
oversized tops from yesterday, Jesse managed to sneak her way into the
alley. "Alright," she mumbled to herself, walking up and down across the
wall and looking for anything to help her find the mysterious door.</p>
<p>She ran her hands along the smooth concrete, hoping for a crack, or some
sort of trick that would reveal the magical knickknack shop; nothing.
Her next attempt was more blunt.</p>
<p>"Matty!" she called out, not as worried about keeping her voice down as
she was getting answers. "Madam Materia! Alice!" she continued to holler
at the wall. Still nothing.</p>
<p>The dark-haired woman pulled out the bracelet, holding it up high to
make sure if the witch was watching she saw. "I have a complaint!" she
barked, feeling frustration greater than that she had from when all this
started taking her over.</p>
<p>Her breaths hot and furious she waited, only for, again, nothing to
happen. Why had she expected anything more from a conwoman? Gritting her
teeth, Jesse wound back her arm. If she couldn't return it to fix
things, then maybe she could just cast it away and be done with it.</p>
<p>As she was about to however, Eve\'s words from that morning echoed in
her mind. <em>"Try and get it done for today?"</em></p>
<p>The woman paused, letting the pent-up feelings wash out of her. She
could still see it in her head, the way, even so large a girl as her
partner had become, had been meek and protective. Jesse let out a heavy
sigh, slumping her shoulders and turning her steel-blue eyes to the
little bauble. Eve liked it, cared about it, and was trusting her to
bring it back to her fixed and fitting. If she just threw it away, what
would her lover think?</p>
<p>All of this had started from these negative feelings she kept on letting
brew deep inside her. She'd been willing to lie, to take something
strange from a witch promising a "solution", that had probably
irreparably changed the woman she loved. And now, she was about to lie
again, and potentially hurt her more.</p>
<p>A single warm tear rolled down her angular cheek, and she slipped the
simple piece back into her pocket. There was a jeweler not far off. If
Eve hadn't spent too much on a new work uniform, she should be able to
get it fitted for her larger than life soulmate. Maybe it might break
whatever spell it cast to modify it.</p>
<p>Either way though, it was time to tell the truth.</p>
<p>Ducking her way through the doorway, and needing to compress her huge
bust in her arms to get through the frame, the auburn-haired beauty
finally arrived home after a long day. And yet, she wore the best smile
anyone could expect to manage as she did. "Hey Jazz," she called out to
her lover.</p>
<p>Jesse was parked on the couch, still in her girlfriend's borrowed top as
she turned to face her. It was hard not to match her partner's
enthusiastic grin, forcing the black-haired girl\'s lips to crack into a
small curve, but that was all she could manage.</p>
<p>"Hey Eve," she greeted her back, her tone more somber, heavy with the
weight of her actions.</p>
<p>Even custom tailored the big girl\'s new work uniform was tight,
stretched over her fat tits to the point you could make out the edges of
her bra. "Worried about what the doctor had to say?" the curvy giantess
asked, coming over to the couch to comfort her love. Her thick bottom
dropping down into the cushions left the piece of furniture groaning in
protest, dipping heavily under her weight. "It's all good," she assured
her, "she said it looks like a pituitary issue, causing some late life
gigantism, but other than that I\'m healthier than I\'ve ever been. I\'m
even getting paid to run a few more tests, since it might be able to
help others with the condition."</p>
<p>It was good news, and Eve was ready to give her a nice squishy hug to
celebrate, but the sloppily-dressed girl refused; holding her hand up,
unable to meet proper eye contact.</p>
<p>All of that positivity drained from the auburn optimist, replaced with
anxious worry. "What's wrong Jazz?"</p>
<p>Having gotten this far didn't make any of this easier. Jesse could feel
her heart hammering nervously, and yet her fingertips still felt cold
and clammy. Fishing through her pocket she got the adjusted bracelet, a
few extra links on its chain to accommodate her partner's larger form.</p>
<p>"Oh, my bracelet," some of her giddy excitement returned, but her somber
lover wasn't done yet, curling her fingers around it to stop it being
taken.</p>
<p>Her voice was caught in her throat, but she had to get over it. With a
deep breath, the office worker steeled herself, building the courage to
do what needed to be done. "Eve, I haven't been honest with you," she
admitted, feeling her whole body tighten with shame, and fear. "I knew
what was causing everything. I got this from a woman in some hokey, back
alley magic store. I know it's not really believable, but it was real
magic. It was like she could read my mind, she knew about you, about
your condition, and she gave me this to make you better," she paused,
her grip tightening on the bauble. "It wasn't for you though; it was for
me.</p>
<p>"I was just so tired, so angry at everything and bottling it up," her
voice started to crack, leaving each word wavering. "I let it get
twisted into something wicked, and it led to me accepting something that
hurt you. That did this," she gestured to the giantess\' wild body, "and
I don't know if I can fix it. I\'m just so..." the first of her tears
escaped her eyes, pouring down her face to land across her lap. "I'm so
sorry Eve."</p>
<p>The tough girl broke down, quivering as she cried and expecting the
backlash she rightfully deserved for her actions. She heard the creak of
the couch as her lover moved, then an arm over her shoulders. Before she
knew it, Eve\'s warmth was all around her, hugging her as tightly into
her huge form as she could, and resting her princess' crying face into
her soft chest.</p>
<p>"I forgive you Jazz," she whispered softly, her own voice quaking with
strong emotions.</p>
<p>Without even needing to think Jesse embraced her, wrapping her arms
around the one she loved. The pair held one another for minutes,
expressing their powerful feelings for one another through so simple a
gesture, until they were ready to move on.</p>
<p>The dark-haired woman finally withdrew, holding out the bracelet for her
soulmate once more. "I got it fixed. I was going to throw it away for
what it did, but you liked it so much," she continued with the truth.
She owed the big girl that much.</p>
<p>Eve gave her that same kind of cracked smile, one hiding deeper emotion
as she started to speak. "I liked it because you gave it to me Jazz,"
she said, taking hold of her girlfriend's hands. "It had been so long
since you looked at me with that shimmer in your eyes, and... I knew
why. That's why I was so happy when I started getting better. I wasn't a
burden anymore, and I could start taking care of you the way you had
been me for too long," she gave a small chuckle, fighting back her own
waterworks. "A part of me knew it was the reason. That's why I was so
scared to give it up," her grip on the trim girl\'s hands tightened. It
wasn't the dumb bauble she was afraid to let go; she was afraid Jesse
might go with it.</p>
<p>The smaller woman squeezed back, finally looking up into those
light-green lights on her partner's face. She could tell, as simply as
the accursed witch could, what her true love was thinking. "I'd never go
anywhere Eve," she promised. Even if none of this had happened, that
much was always true. "I love you more than anyone else in the world."</p>
<p>It was reassuring, enough to make that façade smile genuine, but still
the huge girl needed a little more. "What if I get sick again without
the bracelet?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Who knows if it's even magic anymore, I couldn't exactly take it back
to a disappearing shop," the pitch-haired woman joked. "Even if you get
sick again though, I could never stop loving you."</p>
<p>The auburn beauty brightened, pulling her mate back in for another hug
into her immense bosom. "I really don't like being sick," she gave her
own admission.</p>
<p>"We can keep this aside then," Jesse offered, setting the item down on
the table. "Maybe just it being around will be enough magic to keep you
happy and healthy."</p>
<p>"You're all the 'real' magic I need Jazz," Eve smiled, holding her
closer. "Can you make me one more promise though?" she inquired.</p>
<p>The sharp-featured woman smirked, trying her best to read where this was
going and failing. "What?" she asked back.</p>
<p>The curvy girl dipped down, pressing her lips to her partners for a
quick kiss. "No matter how healthy I get, don't start smoking again.
Kissing you is way better when you don't taste like cigarettes," she
teased.</p>
<p>She couldn't help a laugh, hungrily turning her steel-blue eyes at her
partner. "Promise," she replied, hopping up to wrestle the big girl down
to the couch for some make up make outs.</p>
<p>Reclined in a nice soft seat, the witchy Madam Materia pouted at the
sight unfolding within the orb she held. A quick shake had deep mists
filling it in, the scene jumping ahead to the massive Eve doing her best
to squeeze into their shower, Jesse laughing as she tried to help out.
Another shake, and the pair were getting a new home, adjusted for the
auburn-haired girl\'s incredible size. A third and she was watching the
pair at the altar, the oversized girl\'s buxom form squeezed into a
pristine white dress, as her slim partner wore a crisp suit.</p>
<p>With an unhappy groan the redhead sank back, her hat displaced by her
oversized cushions as she let the image of the lesbians cementing their
marriage with a kiss roll off across the hard floor. Her form began to
shift, her blonde fox ears popping from between her locks and flicking
in agitation, twin fluffy tails shooting up through the crest between
the massive pillows she was resting against, and of course her delicate
hands morphing into their true form as monstrous claws.</p>
<p>From behind Alice\'s head sprang up, worry in her adorable face. "What's
wrong Madam, did I not do good?" she asked, shifting for a better view
and revealing the whole of what her mistress was laying upon to be her
bust. Each were larger than her body, pinning her to the floor by their
sheer size and offering a comfortable seat to the perverted vulpine.</p>
<p>"No, you did fine darling," she reassured, running one of her thick
furred paws over the giant bosom laid out for her, making her way to one
of the girl\'s fist-sized nipples to tease it and distract herself from
her failure.</p>
<p>The overstuffed blonde let out a small little squeak, squirming and
causing her cushioned chest to jiggle. "Then what's wrong? That Eve girl
got pretty big. Not as big as me of course," Alice bragged, doing her
best to push her chest out and fluttering her violet eyes for her Madam.</p>
<p>"Of course, you're my biggest, best girl, my Alice," the redhead cooed,
laying a kiss on her heaving breast. "And I guess I just miscalculated,
I won't make that mistake again when someone deserves punishment," she
explained in the easiest way possible, crawling deeper into her
plaything\'s cleavage. "A bit bigger Alice, I want to be smothered," she
ordered.</p>
<p>The blonde smiled. "Anything for you my Madam," she chirped, her tits
ballooning out to engulf the sinful vulpine in soft boob for a bit.</p>
