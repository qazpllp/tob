Closing
Time, Part I


 


By: Kodos


 


It was a beautiful Thursday evening, really the first
genuinely Spring-timey day we'd had after a long, gray winter that had draped
itself over the city for months, and the last place I wanted to be spending it
was sitting in uptown traffic, but here we were.


 


�Damn, are you sure this place is still going to be open by
the time we get there?� I asked Kelli, as I tried to make a right turn and
nearly got hit by some guy on a bike, �I mean, I know you said you really
wanted to eat there tonight, but we're going to be hitting the road pretty
early tomorrow; can't I just promise to take you anywhere you want for dinner
in a couple of days once we're settled in up in Pittsburgh?�


 


�What? It's only 7:30 and it's still light out; of course
they'll still be open,� Kelli said encouragingly as I dodged down an alley that
had clearly been laid before conversion vans were even invented, �I know it
sounds kind of silly, and you've been working like crazy to get your job all
wrapped up before we pull up stakes, but I've been wanting to go to this place
with you for months, and by this time tomorrow we'll be like, six hours away
and we'll never get here for a date.�


 


I glanced over at her as I narrowly avoided cutting the wrong
way onto a one-way street and smiled in good-natured defeat. I had never been
able to tell this woman no. Tall, with long, raven-black hair that I think she
only wore in a perm because she knew I thought that whole 80s thing was kind of
sexy, a cute nose and eyes that danced with mischief,
and a figure just a little bit on the zaftig side, and I'd been smitten the
moment I'd first laid eyes on her.


 


�Okay, I think we're just a couple blocks away,� I said
optimistically, �It's cool; I know you've been working nights and taking a
pretty heavy load of classes trying to get your degree finished up these last
few months; you deserve a bit of a night out before we jump right into the next
big thing.�


 


�Oh my gosh, tell me about it,� Kelli sighed, reaching out
and lacing her fingers in between mine, �I feel like we've barely had any time
for ourselves the last six months, and I know that between school and work and
the stress of all of it I've put on a few pounds. I bet once we're in a city
where practically everything is build into a hillside I'll walk it all off
before you know it.�


 


�Well, don't feel like you have to spend all those free hours
you'll have outside of translating ancient Sumerian tablets or whatever hitting
the gym,� I assured her, letting go of her hand and reaching over to squeeze
her well-padded thigh, �I'd rather have you be a little bit on the curvy side
and actually be around to hang out with than be all super fit and still never
see you in the evening. Actually, I think I kind of prefer you like this
anyways.�


 


�Oh, so you *do* like me more since I put on thirty
pounds,� she smiled playfully as she moved my hand up a little higher, the
fabric of her skirt snug against her shapely legs, �I was wondering when you'd
finally come out and admit it.�


 


�What? I mean it's not like *that*,� I protested,
worried that in my distraction I'd shared just a little bit too much about what
I really thought of her increasingly-cuddly figure, �If it's stressing you out,
then I'm totally cool with you signing up for a spinning class or whatever you
want. We'll finally have enough money to do stuff like that without having to
worry about every penny going to rent and tuition and all that, which'll be great. I just-�


 


�Just what? Enjoy taking me to bed
and sucking on my boobs now they're actually big enough to play with, or
smacking me on the butt whenever you catch me leaning over anything around the
apartment?� Kelli asked, reveling in my predicament, �Oh don't look all
panicked like that; it's not like I haven't been enjoying the extra attention
lately.�


 


�How did you know?� I asked, trying to keep my attention on
the crowded road ahead.


 


�What, like you didn't think I noticed the way you looked at
me when you came home and found me laying on the couch in a pair of yoga pants
because none of my other pants fit me anymore, or the fact that for the last
few months, whenever we're spooning in bed you keep draping your arm over my
belly and fondling my muffin top? Don't worry; I'm a big girl, if it bothered
me I'd have let you know, and anyways, speaking of which, here we are. Look,
there's an open spot right on front!�


 


I slammed on the brakes, eliciting an angry honk from someone
behind me, and backed into place along the busy street.


����������� 


�Here, just get out on my side,� Kelli suggested as she
opened her door and slid from her seat to the sidewalk, �You'll be waiting
forever for a break in traffic on your side.�


 


I smiled as I watched her get out; feeling way too relieved
that she was okay with me liking that she'd gained a bit of weight lately; the
sight of her all-too-smackable bottom before she
turned to hold the door open for me leaving me hoping that she wouldn't be
hitting the gym *too* hard once we got all relocated. I awkwardly worked
my way across her seat and then out the door after her, and there we were.


 


�'The Muffin Top',� I said, looking up at the cartoonishly bulging letters above broad glass door before
turning my attention to a large banner spread across the windows to either side
of the entrance, �'Sumptuously Furnished, Generously Expanded! If You Haven't
Seen Us Lately, You're Missing Quite a Bit.' Just what
kind of place is this, anyways?�


 


�I told you before,� Kelli said, grabbing my hand insistently
and pulling me across the sidewalk, �They do coffee, desserts; I know that's
not your thing, but I'm pretty sure you can get a beer here too, if you just
want to talk while you watch me eat. It's supposed to be the best place for a
hundred miles around, at least. Come on, let's not
waste any more time, okay?�


 


I followed her inside. The whole place was done up kind of
like a 50s diner, black and white tile floor, cherry red walls, with lots of
chrome trim to boot. The front window hadn't been lying, even in the fading
light of the evening, the whole place practically gleamed, and I found myself
gazing around with far more interest than I'd expected as Kelli lead me to a
large table right near the register, just across from a display case that
looked like it contained about a hundred different kinds of sweets, pastries
and other indulgences. I have to admit thought, it
wasn't just the restaurant that drew my attention.


 


At a table corner table near the front sat a woman with a
strikingly lush figure. She wore her red hair in a close-cropped, but unmistakeably feminine style, and her dark-framed glasses
looked in danger of slipping off her nose as she intently read a romance novel,
a half-finished mug of coffee steaming on the table in her free hand. And she
was beautiful. The cream-colored sweater she wore was loosely-tailored, but
nothing could have disguised her more-than-ample bosom, her full breasts
jostling each other for room, hemmed in on either side by her plump arms, and
supported in part by what looked to be a belly that she rarely permitted to remain
empty for long. She had a slight double chin, the kind that only really makes
an appearance when its owner is looking sharply downwards, and as we drew
alongside her table, I saw that she was just as generously formed down below, a
pair of well-worn jeans stretched tight across her fat thighs, straining to
encompass her womanly hips. The next moment, the bell on the front door rang as
it swung closed, and lifted momentarily from her reading, she glanced up at us
and smiled before returning to her book. I risked a glance back as we passed
her, and I saw a four inch gap between edge of her sweater and the snug
waistband of her jeans, the lower portion of which gave a view of her of
shimmery blue panties, their elastic straining around her opulent middle. Another
year of living off junk food and making excuses to avoid the gym, I mused, and
Kelli might be boasting a figure like that, and I found myself surprised to
discover how attractive the idea struck me.


 


I glanced back at my wife, half-expecting her to be glaring
at me over my obviously wandering eyes, but saw that she was still intently
looking towards the back of the bakery, leading me toward a table as close to
the counter with such an unnaturally wide door cut into it that I wondered if
this place hadn't been a mattress store or something before this. I pulled a
chair out for her, again staring appraisingly as her own far-from-slender rump,
mentally working out just how many pounds there were between her and the bosomy
book woman up front, when I realized first, that Kelli wasn't sitting down, and
second that her attention was on a booth tucked away in a dim and cozy corner
of the place. She was staring, and a moment later I realized why.


 


If the woman near the front of the store had been buxom, the
one tightly-stuffed between her bench and table was utterly voluptuous. The
sleeveless red top she wore was stretched almost to transparency by breasts at
least double the size of her head, her fat nipples thrusting insistently at the
thin fabric in a way that made me wonder how she had dared to come out in
public braless without getting in trouble with the police. Her belly so fat and
round that I first imagined she must be pregnant, though the way the edge of
the table dug into its expansive bulk without seeming to cause her even a hint
of discomfort suggested I was wrong. She was wearing a stretchy-looking skirt,
and while the lowermost regions of her belly were crammed into its waistband,
quite possibly ultimately resting on the bench between her casually-widespread
thighs. I couldn't see much more than that in the shadows beneath her table,
though I could make out the pale outline of her bare leg below the hem of her
dark skirt, below her knee and still as thick as the woman up front's thighs
had been. 


 


Several large and empty plates and dishes were carelessly
arrayed on the table in front of her, and as we watched, she swallowed one last
spoonful of something chocolate, gave a delighted shudder as the sound of
several stitches popping echoed off the walls, and then settled down
contentedly, absent-mindedly reaching slightly down the front of her skirt and
appreciatively rubbing the soft-vastness of her belly, her top riding up enough
to expose her navel, deep, indulgent, and all but hidden between two jigglesome
rolls of fat. She glanced towards the cash register, paying us and our
unmannered staring no mind.


 


�Chrissie!� she called out, sounding more like she was
calling out to a very satisfying lover than her server for the afternoon, �I
think I've had about as much as I can hold; could you bring out my check,
please?�


 


�Coming!� replied a cheerful voice from some way back in what
must have been the kitchen. The was the sharp, energetic sound of steps
approaching, the door behind the counter swung open and I heard a gasp of
amazement, though whether it was mine of Kelli's is something that the two of
us still argue about now and then.


 


The girl who emerged from the back room was so spectacularly
massive that for a moment, I wasn't even sure where to start staring. She was
dressed up in sort of a modern red and white checkered outfit that went well
with the way the rest of the place was done up, her long, blond hair pulled
back in a ponytail, and suddenly I wasn't wondering about why the doors in this
place were all so ridiculously wide. I swear, she had
to weigh half a ton if she weighed an ounce. 


 


Even with the counter between her and us she looked
undeniably immense, the checked fabric of her short dress drawn tight as a drum
by a bosom swollen to nearly five feet across, and impossibly round and
buoyant, like a set of overinflated yoga balls. If she had deigned to lean
forwards, her breasts would have covered the entire depth of the counter and
probably bulged over the front lip of it by a good six inches, and despite the
fact that it would have been a miracle if they *only* weighed a hundred
pounds each, her titanic melons still bulged up pneumatically from the
unfastened few buttons of her outfit, so plump and jigglesome that she probably
could have motorboated herself effortlessly, and from
the knowing smile she wore and the way she carried herself, I wondered how
often she did.


 


A white apron with red trim was tied around her, though since
it didn't seem to have been specifically tailored for her stunningly
well-favored figure, it looked more like a small bib
pulled down between her mammoth breasts. Chrissie made her way to the register,
coming at it sort of sideways because her bust was quite possibly as impossible
for her to reach past as it surely must have been to see around, punched a few
keys, and seized the ticket it printed out with gusto a moment later, and
bounced through the counter gate.


 


She was just as unbelievably well-favored below as she was up
top. Her hips were just an inch or two less fulsome than her bust, so
sumptuously wide that just hurrying across the restaurant was nearly enough to
send her tumbling to the floor, their tremendous girth, tightly bound up in a
skirt several sizes too small forced her into an unnatural, restricted gait, as
if their sheer immensity gave every step more momentum than she could quite
control. As Chrissie turned, I realized that her belly wasn't just fat, it was
colossal, projecting out in front of her nearly as far as her protuberant
bosom, and the only thing keeping it from jiggling like a mountain of jelly was
the tantalizing tautness of her outfit. 


 


A moment later I realized just how far out her profile
extended in the other direction as well; her ass was positively gigantic,
bulging out so impressively behind her that her every movement seemed to take a
second to reach it, so round and fat that the hem of her dress barely covered
it; just another pound or two in the right places and anyone behind her
wouldn't have to guess at the color of her panties. As titanically
voluptuous and overladen as she was though, Chrissie moved with practiced
confidence and even gracefulness, as if she had been this huge for a long time,
and was perfectly comfortable with her figure, both in simply carrying her
voluptuous burdens around, and in being absolutely delighted to present
herself- every last ounce- to the world.


 


She made her way to the booth with the full-bellied woman,
drew a notepad out of her cleavage, and leaned onto the table. I heard it
creaking under the weight of her breasts as she sighed with relief, revealing,
in the process, more than enough of a glimpse to us standing behind her to
establish that purple was the color of the day. 


 


Remembering myself, I glanced at Kelli, expecting anything
from a smoldering glare to a slap across the face, but instead I found her
staring just as spellbound as the enormous waitress chatting up her customer
across way. Kelli must have felt me watching; she looked at me, smiled
teasingly, and slowly sat down in her chair, quickly returning her attention to
the booth nearby. A moment later I followed her example, relived to be
ensconced at a table where my reaction to all these spectacularly buxom women
was better hidden.


 


�Well now, Mallory, I've got to admit, I didn't believe you
when you said you were going to finish every last bite,� Chrissie said
playfully, �I'd almost be tempted to say you've been slipping my cupcakes into
your purse for later, but just look at that belly of yours; you're practically
groaning with repletion.�


 


�And how could I ever disappoint you?� Mallory responded
blithely, �Though I do have to admit, after the fifth dozen or so, I did begin
to wonder if I was pushing myself just a bit too far. But then, I remembered
you're minding this place all by yourself for a few days, and who knows what
Mara would do to you if she came back to find that customers had been forcing
you to throw out unfinished desserts?�


 


�Mmm, what indeed?� Chrissie asked,
giving her opulent rump a shimmy, �When you put it that way, I'm almost tempted
to find out; I'm sure whatever my punishment, it would surely lead to padding
out my ample figure even more.�


 


�Well if next time I come in I see that you've gone up
another half-dozen cup sizes, I won't even need to ask for the blow-by-blow,�
Mallory said conspiratorially, �Though you know I will anyway, and not a single
detail spared.�


 


�Shush; you're absolutely incorrigible,� Chrissie said,
taking a halfhearted swipe at Mallory with her notepad, �If that's how you're
going to be, then next time you come in I'm going to ask how Sasha enjoyed her
first night with a four hundred pound girlfriend.�


 


�Oh, if you're lucky, maybe I'll bring pictures,� Mallory
giggled, �But I really shouldn't keep the poor girl waiting any longer; she's
been at home all afternoon fantasizing about just how enormous I'll be when I
get home. Here, don't even worry about getting my change; you've earned
yourself a generous tip, and if Mara decides you haven't been keeping this
place in tip-top shape, you can use it to buy some new outfits once she's
finished with you. Anyways, I should let you get down to giving your other
customers some service; have a lovely evening, okay?�


 


Mallory tried, failed, and then tried twice more to heave
herself out of the booth, before finally, huffing and panting she succeeded.
Unlike Chrissie, who carried herself with an ease that belied her weight, she
looked like she was anything but used to her controlling her body this way. She
leaned needfully against every last piece of
furniture within reach as she made for the door, staggering almost drunkenly,
swearing quietly to herself as her well-rounded hips knocked a chair out of her
way, gasping as the edge of a table caught her hard in the belly. I wondered
just how much this woman had put on since she sat down; she was waddling like
she had doubled in weight and in all of her more feminine dimensions in the
space of a few hours, but that was impossible. The drinks list on the table
caught my eye- that had to be it. No matter how much she had gorged herself
today, she had doubtless already been exceedingly full-figured, and the fact
that the all the empty glasses on her table looked like they had brought
milkshakes instead of margaritas was hardly evidence otherwise.


 


I shot a glance as Kelli, who was beaming at me with a
thousand watt smile, then looked back up and saw that Chrissie, smiling just as
radiantly, was already halfway to our table. It was unreal watching her
approach, the nearer she came the more overwhelming she seemed.


 


�Well, good afternoon, I'm Chrissie and I don't believe I've
had the pleasure of seeing you two in here before,� she said with the air of
someone used to making her customers very, very satisfied. She looked at Kelli
intently, �Now, before we go any further, are you just a happy couple who
ducked in off the street for a snack and a cup of coffee, or do you already
know that we're a bit of a specialty shop?�


 


�We're moving out of town tomorrow morning,� Kelli explained,
�He's only here because he likes to make me happy, but I know exactly what y'all's stock and trade is, and I want to experience
everything you've got, or at least enough to keep us both nice and warm on
those cold northern nights we've got ahead of us. What do you recommend?�


 


�Well, it's getting a little late in the day for me to really
give you the works, but let me see what I might have fixed up already that will
make the other girls jealous and keep someone's eyes from wandering,� Chrissie
said, reaching into the cleavage and pulling out her notepad again, then
learning onto our table with an exaggerated sigh, �Sorry, when a girl's got as
much weight up top to carry around as I have, it's important to never pass up
an opportunity to give her back a bit of a rest.�


 


I tried my best to look her in the eyes, but I couldn't help
myself. Her breasts were practically spilling out of her top and onto the table
just inches from Kelli and me, larger than yoga balls and so soft that I had to
fight the compulsion to reach out and give one a squeeze, if only to prove to
myself that this was real. No woman's breasts grow this gigantic. Even the most
extreme implants I'd ever seen came close to the size of Chrissie's twins, and
from the way they bulged against the hard table, their rondure
rising and falling gently as she breathed, her skin flawless and smooth and
inviting- it didn't matter how fat she was everywhere else; if women like this
existed, someone would have told the world about it by now.


 


Kelli, moreover, seemed just as transfixed by the heavenly
globes laid nearly bare before us. She stared at Chrissie's bust with an
expression of- certainly not jealousy, and I don't think reverence is quite the
right word either. If anything it was almost- anticipation. This was getting
stranger by the second, but leaving before I found out what Kelli had in mind
was the last thing I wanted to do.


 


�So, if I may presume to make recommendations,� Chrissie
said, looking first at me and then fixing Kelli with a penetrating stare,
�Might I suggest a beer for the gentleman; you strike me as the kind of man who
appreciates something, hmm, full-bodied, and for you miss, well, let me just
see what I've got laying around that might satisfy your appetites.�


 


�Yes please,� Kelli said without a moment's hesitation, �I'm
sure whatever you can figure out exactly what I'm craving.�


 


�Alright then; you two just sit right here and I'll be back
in a jiffy,� Chrissie said, turning as she stepped away so that she just barely
grazed the edge of our table with her lusciously overfed bottom, before calling
over her shoulder to Kelli, �Oh, excuse me; I guess there's just so much of me
I still don't know how far I out go sometimes. Not that you'd need to know
anything about that.�


 


�Okay, what's going on here?� I asked Kelli as soon as
Chrissie disappeared into the kitchen, �Is this some kind of bakery just for
fat women or something?�


 


�Mmm, and what if it is?� Kelli
asked, having seen far too much of my reaction in the last few minutes for her
to have any doubts about how I felt about such things, �I mean, I've been
living off of cheap junk for months and I've put on like, thirty pounds. I
figure I at least owe myself some real top-quality junk before we leave town.�


 


�I thought you were all gung-ho to join a gym or take up
jogging or something once we get moved in,� I said carefully, sure that she was
playing with me, �Why the sudden change of heart?�


 


�Well, maybe whether I do or don't is going to depend on
you,� she said, casting me an appraising eye, �What do you think of our friend
up by the window with the trashy romance novel and the sweater full of tits?�


 


�Oh, um, her?� I asked, glancing
casually towards the only other customer in the place as if I had only just
noticed her existence, �I don't know, I guess she's, you know, kind of cute, if
you think so.�


 


�Yeah, I wonder how much tighter those jeans of hers can get
before she splits her seams,� Kelli mused furtively, �I almost want to order
her a whole platter of something really rich and then just wait and see if we
can hear the stitches popping from all the way over here- don't you think that
would be fun?�


 


�Well,� I said, trying to be as cagey as possible, �I mean,
if you want to, I'm just here to make sure our last night here in town is
special, so I'm not going to try to talk you out of it.�


 


�Okay, and what about our friend in
the booth over there who just left, with those thick arms of hers spreading out
against that red top and fifty pounds of belly more than her skirt could hold?�


 


�I dunno,� I began feeling increasingly sure that this was
going to culminate in revenge for all my less-than-subtle staring, �I think she
knows what looks good on her better than I do and you know, it's kind of nice
seeing a woman with a bit of a fuller figure not feeling like she needs to
dress like she's ashamed of her body, I guess?�


 


�Oh, don't be coy, you're no good at it,� Kelli said
knowingly, leaning in across the table, �Don't tell me you wouldn't enjoy
spending a little time alone with a woman whose tits were bigger than her head,
listening to them slap against her body while you fucked her. And that belly-
you've been showing mine all sorts of attention lately and I'm just a little on
the chubby side; I bet it makes you hard just thinking of sinking your fingers
into a soft, indulgent tummy like hers and just fondling all that fat until
you're ready to come.�


 


�Well, I like you because you're you,� I insisted lamely,
�And, well, I mean guess a woman with a figure like that would be something
kind of different, but if that's all I wanted we wouldn't be married, I
wouldn't be all excited about starting fresh in a new city and doing all that
together with you.�


 


�Okay, here's your drinks; everything else will be out in
just a sec,� Chrissie said brightly, appearing from nowhere and plunking down a
bottle of some local craft brew in front of me and a milkshake in front of
Kelli in a glass that looked like it had to contain at least a gallon of
strawberry ice cream and cold milk, �Don't mind me; you just carry right on
with your romantic little conversation. Oh, don't let me forget to pop that
open for you before I leave.�


 


With a dramatic flourish Chrissie reached into the depths of
cleavage, nearly up to her plump elbow, before finally drawing out a bottle
opener, leaning over the table so far that her breasts threatened to burst free
from the confinement of her top, knocking over the bottle and giving me a face
full of her mammoth mammaries. They jiggled energetically as she grunted with
exaggerated effort as she opened the bottle, giving a shiver of surprise as the
cap popped off and a spritz of foam sprayed against
her exposed flesh. Chrissie gave a self-assured smile and headed back to the
kitchen, while Kelli smiled at me wickedly.


 


�And what about our ever-so-attentive
waitress here?� Kelli asked, resuming her inquisition, �Where do you
even start with that much woman? Well, *I* know where you'd start; it was
written all over your face while she was fishing around inside her cleavage to
open your beer. I bet that right now you're thinking of sticking your cock
right between her tits and just going to town until every last inch of her
chest is hot and sticky, aren't you? But that's just the obvious place to
start, isn't it? You've always loved taking me from behind when I'm in the mood
for it; can you imagine trying that with a woman like her? Even down on her
hands and knees, I bet she can just let go and lay on her tits like her own
personal waterbed- wouldn't you love to see them quivering helplessly while you
rode her? Her belly must spread out nearly as wide when she's in the right
position; I bet if she could actually force those huge thighs of hers apart
wide enough, you could feel it slapping against your legs as you pounded her.
And those hips; do you think you could even hold on to her like that while you
were pumping her full of cum, if you weren't playing with those obscenely overfattened melons of hers, you'd probably just have to
bury your hands between her rolls and try to hold on to her waist, if you could
even find it. And that's not even the million dollar question: how do you even
inside a woman with an ass like that? I mean, I'm sure once you get her out of
those clothes she's as soft and pliable as Jello; but
you'd still have to go hard if you wanted to get through all that fat and
actually give her what a girl really wants. Well, maybe not as much as some
guys would have to try; I know you've got more than enough to get the job done.
Would you feel good doing that, taking a woman like her and just fucking her
until she was whimpering for mercy, making her come, making her quiver until
neither of you could get out of bed the next day and all she could manage in
the morning was to roll over, bury your legs under her monster tits, and suck
your dick while you tugged on her nipples just to get her all turned on and
frustrated, until she was begging you for more even though she was already so
sore she could barely move. Don't you dare tell me you wouldn't jump at a
chance for that.�


 


�Okay, okay, I- well, I'm not going to pretend like I didn't
notice her- I mean, geez, I'd have to be blind to miss all of *that*, and
it's not like I begged her to slap her boobs down on the table, so don't make
me the bad guy here,� I protested, �What's gotten into you anyways? You usually
don't get all dirty like this until you've had a few drinks and we're alone
together; what gives?�


 


�Sorry, I didn't mean to make you mad,� Kelli apologized,
taking a long drink from her milkshake, draining half the tall glass as I
watched, �I just, well, I guess I just wanted to make sure that you were really
into this kind of thing before I went and did anything- well, anything that I
won't be able to take back later.�


 


�It's okay, I know you've been stressed with school and
moving and everything too,� I said, reaching out and taking her hand, �You're
just acting like- I dunno- like I keep expecting any moment that someone is
about to pop up and shout 'Surprise!', but I still can't figure out what the
surprise even *is*.�


 


�Well, since I'm more than satisfied that I've made the right
decision, one that's going to make both of us very happy, I might as well tell
you,� Kelli said enigmatically, before taking the thick straw in her mouth and
sucking down the rest of her milkshake as she silently smiled at me, �Or maybe
showing you would be more fun.�


 


And with that, she shoved the empty glass across the table
towards me, sat up straight in her seat, shoulders back and eyes twinkling, and
shot me an expectant look. A split-second later I realized what was happening, and I nearly fell out of my chair.


 


�Holy cow, Kelli,� I stammered, �Your boobs- they're- they're
bigger!�


 


�Mmm, aren't they though,� Kelli murmured with pride as she
cupped them in her hands and gave herself a calculating squeeze that made them
bulge sensually from the confines of her suddenly-outgrown bra, �I think I'm at
least a D-cup now, don't you agree?�


 


�I'd say you're probably ready to fill out an E,� Chrissie
said, once more appearing with remarkable abruptness and laying a tray of a
dozen muffins, each one too large for Kelli to hold with one hand and all of
different varieties, in front of my wife, whose eyes went wide as she
contemplated the feast laid out before her, �Though I'd advise you not to go
out shopping for new bras just yet; even a few bites of these will send those
nice little handfuls of yours skyrocketing through the alphabet fast enough to
make your head spin.�


 


�Wait, so you mean that the food here is *that* fattening?�
I asked, my disbelief checked by the fact that Kelli's white blouse was
considerably more snug than it had been a minute ago and she really did look
like she had gained at least a few new inches of bustline since she started in
on her milkshake, �So that woman who could barely stand up earlier really did
gain all that weight just now while she was here?�


 


�Well, at least three hundred pounds or so of it,� Chrissie
said with a laugh, �When she came in she was actually just about the same size
as your girl here. Of course, she knew what she was doing- when she came in
those clothes were practically falling off of her so she'd be decent, barely,
to get home by herself. But why are you wasting your time talking with me? I
think your attention would be better spent attending to this lovely lady right
here.�


 


I looked back to Kelli, and she was already several bites
into the first muffin, a huge chocolate affair with king-size Hershey kisses
instead of chips dotting its surface. Kelli gave me the most seductive look and
took a huge mouthful of it, crumbs cascading down the front of her shirt. Her
breasts fattened and grew as I watched, dumbstruck, swelling out of her bra
like rising bread until they were nearly twice a full as they had been just a
few minutes ago. Beaming with satisfaction, she took a deep breath, and I heard
her cups straining to endure the growing load she had saddled them with.
Playfully, Kelli pulled an empty chair closer to her side and patted it
invitingly.


 


�Why don't you come over here and feed me?� She asked innocently,
�There's no reason I should have to do all the work here. Besides, I think
you'll enjoy the show more if you've got a better seat- and speaking of which,
see what you're missing all the way over on your side of the table?�


 


Kelli stood up. I felt dizzy. It wasn't just her breasts, she
was filling out everywhere. Her once-modest little belly now bulged with at
least another fifteen pounds of fat, and her hips, which had never been
particularly curvy before, now flared out slightly, but ever so suggestively
broader than her waist. Slowly, indulgently, she lifted her arms over her head-
how could I have missed noticing how much thicker they had already become?- and gave a slow turn. Her butt was incredible. It wasn't
just that it was growing too, but for the first time since we'd met it didn't
look like it had mostly been shaped by the confines of an office chair. Now she
was round and plump back there, looking from this angle less like a grad
student with a penchant for junk food and more like an extra from a Sir
Mix-a-Lot video.


 


By the time she was back in her seat, I was already at her
side, another muffin already in-hand. As she plopped her shapely rump into the
chair, she leaned forward and practically buried her face in the muffin, biting
off more than I would have imagined she could fit in her mouth. She leaned
back, savoring every moment of this as she lazily chewed and swallowed. It was
like an entire six-hour Thanksgiving feast was packed into that one nourishing
mouthful, her belly forcing the gap between her skirt and top to open wider,
her hips inching slightly closer to the edges of her broad seat, her breasts
quavering with gentle insistence as they swelled, her cherry-colored areolae
peeking above her meager cups and all too easy to see as her shirt was
stretched out further and further to contain her ballooning endowments.


 


�Mmm, enjoying the show?� Kelli asked, endlessly pleased at
the sight of me so enthralled with her expanding figure, �Aren't you happy I
called you over here for a front row seat?�


 


�Do you even have to ask?� I said, mesmerized as she picked
up one of the few remaining chunks of the muffin and popped it into her mouth,
�I guess I'm just wondering whether this is just the first act or whether
you're getting close to the climax already?�


 


�Climax, here in the bakery in front of Chrissie and
everything? You dirty boy,� Kelli scolded me, wagging a finger in my direction
and showing that her arms had just the slightest hint of a jiggle now, �That's
for when we get home tonight, of course, though you might be able to talk me
into some rising action on the way back if you can find a quiet place for the
van to pull off. But to answer your question, as far as I'm concerned, this is
still just the overture.�


 


�Well, if that's what you've got your heart set on, you'd
better pace yourself,� I said, hefting the muffin I held and marveling at how
unnaturally dense it felt, �Here, why don't you just sit back and let me feed
you for a little while?�


 


�Oh, please do,� Kelli breathed, leaning back in her chair,
eyes closed and mouth open wide and waiting as I broke off a decent chunk of
the muffin, this one was blueberry, and carefully pushed it past her lips.


 


She murmured pleasure as I fed her, shuddering with little
tremors of bliss as every swallow rendered her more voluptuous. Kelli chewed; I
could hear the elastic of her skirt-band gently stretching as her belly grew
fuller. She swallowed; the top button of her blouse burst off and ricocheted
off the table before rolling away into some distant corner of the shop, as I
gazed in wonder at the lush vista of cleavage Kelli's expanding dimensions had laid partly bare. I wanted more; I wanted to see her
bustline swell until it tore her top to shreds. I wanted to see her breasts,
naked and pale, quivering submissively as they were glutted with flesh, so huge
they rested on the table before her, so heavy that they slapped against her
thighs, her belly when she finally, stuffed to the very limit, reluctantly
pushed herself away from the table. I couldn't wait; I pushed another third of
the muffin into her mouth. For a moment I worried I had given her too much at
once; Kelli kind of gagged a little, surprised to find her mouth so full, but a
moment later she gave a sigh of longing and began to swallow it down as fast as
she could chew.


 


As she ate, her belly began to bulge out over the top of her
skirt, just a couple of inches at first, but tantalizing to behold. I reached
down with my free hand and gave it a squeeze, that ripening crescent of self-indulgence
that spread from one hip to her other. She was soft; I could already just sink
my fingers into the yielding burgeoning richness of her middle, and she
trembled at my touch, a quiet cry catching in her dessert-crammed throat. She
swallowed the last of it down, her bosom developing as if she were pregnant and
all the maternal gains of that condition were being forced upon her body in the
span of a few minutes. Her breasts became more alluring enlarged, rising higher
and higher out of her cups, until with a jolt they popped out of her bra
entirely, leaving it little more than a band wrapped around her chest, serving
no purpose beyond making her breasts push against the confinement of her blouse
a little more insistently, and digging in against her sides where I could see
that Kelli was beginning to develop nascent rolls of fat.


 


She opened her mouth again; I still held nearly half the
blueberry muffin. I didn't hesitate, and plunged the entire thing beyond her
waiting lips. This time she was ready.


����������� 


Kelli moaned sensually, staring at me lustfully as she bolted
the mouthful down as fast as she was able. Her breasts, already larger than
cantaloupes, swelled in response, her blouse constricting tighter and tighter
around their fattening girth until I wondered how she was able to even breathe.
A moment later the problem took care of itself as *Pop!*, another button
shot across the table, permitting her bust to expand comfortably outwards, her
cleavage deepening, and her entire bosom wobbling enticingly as the bulk of her
breasts settled in a couple inches lower than before, now nearly resting
against the upper reaches of her indulgent belly. 


 


As if in sympathy with its neighbor to the north, there was a
loud snap as the lowest button on Kelli's blouse gave way as well, her
blossoming belly taking advantage of this new freedom to advance further out
onto her lap, the waistband of her skirt now completely hidden beneath its
supple and ever-growing weight. As she gasped and choked on her mouthful,
Kelli's hands shot to her bare midriff, eagerly kneading its pliant burden, as
she shuddered as if she were already on the brink of climax. Her belly was
rising, I realized, not only due to its own growth, but because her thighs were
thickening beneath it, becoming sleek and fat as whatever power imbued
Chrissie's cooking forced them to accept their just share of added weight.


 


I picked up a third muffin, this one dripping with some kind
of caramel, in anticipation for the very second that Kelli swallowed the last
of her present morsel. She was already more delectably buxom than anything I
had ever dared to dream she might become, and if this was after only two
muffins, how spectacularly voluptuous would she be after supplementing her
figure with the eight more that yet remained for her enjoyment? Just how
impossibly womanly, how sensually immense would she be by the time we left
tonight? Surely Kelli would burst out of her top entirely before long, maybe
even before she was done with the very treat I held in my hand; after ten like
this though, just how busty would she be? I tried to imagine her with breasts
bigger than her head, then bigger than beachballs,
quivering naked and ponderous as she crammed down the last bite, and my
imagination failed me. I tried to envision her with hips twice as broad as her
shoulders, her ass so supremely overfattened that it
stuck out like a shelf behind her, jiggling and swaying seductively with every
awkward step she took. And her belly, just how big was Kelli going to get in
front? Was she going to waddle out of here looking like she was merely nine
months pregnant with twins, or was she going to end up like some of those girls
I'd seen online from time to time, with a belly so indecently lavish that it
filled her lap completely when she sat down, and hung nearly to her knees when
she stood? 


 


I knew that Kelli could gain every last ounce of that, and
I'd only want her more, but for a brief moment, I wondered if that was really
what *she* wanted too. Sure, I knew right now she wanted to gain weight,
and so far the results were absolutely stunning, but then again I imagined that
she couldn't possibly be much over two hundred pounds right now, not waifishly thin, to be sure, but hardly unnatural,
especially for a girl as tall as her. Would she be so eager to keep lading it
on as that number grew though? No matter how sublimely proportioned Kelli
remained, would she still be begging for more as she passed three hundred
pounds? As tall as she was, at four hundred pounds she would have to expect people
to stare and whisper when she went out in public, especially since she was on
track to have a figure like someone's demented dream of a living fertility
idol. Five hundred pounds, and she'd be gigantic. It
made my heart pound just to imagine her that huge, thinking of walking in on
her in the shower at that size, or stepping into the
kitchen to find her in a pair of too-tight panties as an undersized apron as
she cooked up breakfast for us. Six hundred pounds, was it even possible? If
Kelli managed to stuff down every last crumb on the table could she really end
up that massive? Would we have to get our apartment specially redone just so
she could fit through the doors at that size? I thought about waking up in the
middle of the night to the voice of my wife begging for my touch, her breasts
swollen to obscene dimensions, her opulent hips spreading wide across the
sagging mattress, her plush belly rolling and bouncing like a stormy sea from
the moment I entered her until long after I shot myself inside her and we both
lay there, hot, exhausted and satisfied. 


 


I knew what I wanted. If we had been alone, I think I might
have even been willing to wait to fatten Kelli up even more just for the
pleasure of having her right here, right now, but was I forcing her to go along
with all this just to slake my own desires? My answer wasn't long in coming.
Kelli swallowed the last bit she had been working on, her rosy areolae
beginning to peek out from her overburdened blouse as the gap down its middle
steadily widened.


 


�Ooh, that's it, feed me hard; don't wait for me to swallow,
just force it down my throat!� she moaned, grabbing at my wrist and pulling the
next muffin closer, �Come on, don't be gentle; show me that you want this as
much a I do, that you can't wait to have me as fat
and curvy and willing as I can possibly get; I don't want my mouth to be empty
enough for me to say another word until you've stuffed me with every bite on
this table and this chair is ready to collapse under me!�


 


I didn't need more convincing than that; I raised my hand and
crammed the muffin I held into her mouth. Crumbs tumbled across the tablecloth
as I forced it into her mouth, and large, sticky drops of caramel fell thick
and rich into Kelli's ripening cleavage as she surrendered any fealty to good
manners and simply ate as if her life depended on inhaling every last bite as
gluttonously as possible. Even as she chocked and gagged at the huge mouthful,
I could tell she was determined to gorge herself as hard as humanly possible; I
could hear the seams of her top creaking as every last calorie she consumed
instantly added to her burgeoning voluptuousness. Her belly, indulgently soft
and jiggly, poured past the overtaxed waistband of her skirt, her navel lost in
the deep roll forming and deepening across her lush middle, while the dark
material that barely contained her modesty below the waist stretched farther
and farther, it's color fading to tan as Kelli's thighs thickened, her hips
broadening until they spread broad enough at last to fill the
generously-proportioned chair in which she sat.


 


Kelli swallowed it down as fast as she could; I was amazed
she was even able to breathe, not only due to how obsessed she was with eating,
but because the weight of her chest was plainly increasing at a scandalous
rate. Kelli's breasts were blowing up like balloons; every time she swallowed
the seemed to gain another cup size, expanding from overflowing handfuls to
plumped-up udders the size of her head, two more buttons bursting off her
blouse in less than a minute, the remaining dew that held her top closed now
buried between her bosom and belly as her top took on the look of something
worn by a plus-sized porn star playing the part of a prodigiously well-endowed
secretary, her breasts bulging out wider than her chest, piling up in the
restrictive confines of her blouse until their quivering upper hemispheres rose
higher than her collarbone. 


 


I pushed the last chunk of muffin into her, and Kelli
shuddered with satisfaction, her arms now so plump that her short sleeves clung
to her like overstuffed sausage casings, the way her arms bulged out just
beyond their ends suggesting that the moment she was freed from their
constrictive embrace, she was likely to gain several more inches of padding
there, and quite possibly more. She moaned softly as she swallowed, as if it
was all she could do to keep herself from ripping off her skirt and finding out
how best to reach the swelling tenderness between her fattening thighs, or
perhaps just stripping down until she was naked, and throwing herself, naked,
willing and expectant onto the table, desperate for me to ravish her. She
wanted to be bigger though, softer, heavier, fatter, whatever pleasures her
recently-won shapeliness might hold, Kelli labored in hope of far more
impressive wages in return for her devotion to gluttony. 


 


The last bite vanished down Kelli's throat as she licked her
lips, craving every last crumb that might further feed her expanding figure,
and she slowly opened her eyes, looking at me with satisfaction commingled with
insatiable desire.


 


�Oh, but you know how to show a girl a good time; I only hope
you can keep that up once we're back at our place later tonight,� Kelli teased,
�So, before you stuff me with the rest of these and *really* give me the
kind of body that can keep a fella warm at night in
those long norther winters, how about a little
glimpse at just what all your hard work has accomplished so far?�


 


She didn't need to wait for my answer; Kelli already knew me
too well for that. With a lascivious smile, she pushed her seat away from the
table, stood up, looking for one tantalizing moment like all the weight she'd
put on was going to sent her toppling right over, boobs-first into the table,
and then tentatively placing one of her feet on the chair, leaning over it as
she reached for the hem of her skirt.


 


�I know you've already gotten more than an eyeful of how big
and fat my breasts are getting, though believe me, you'll be seeing *vastly*
more impressive mountains and valleys than that by the time the night is over,�
Kelli teased, �And I'm sure you've noticed the plump little belly of mine
you've enjoyed playing with these last few months has grown to such delectable
proportions while you've been stuffing me nearly too fast for me to handle, but
maybe you'd like a little sneak preview of some of what you haven't gotten a
good look at since I sat down at this table.�


 


She leaned forwards, her ass jutting out behind her
enticingly; I had known Kelli was fattening up back there just like she was
everywhere else, but this exceeded my wildest expectations. Her thick hips
pushed out wider than her shoulders, and her ass was so huge that I could see
her panties through the overstretched fabric of her skirt, round and jiggly
even imprisoned within her too-small clothes. Kelli smiled, grabbing the hem of
her skirt and hiking it up, her full breasts weighing heavily against her lush
thigh, her breath catching in her throat as her fat belly rubbed against it. 


 


As she pulled up her skirt, Kelli revealed a pair of legs
almost too voluptuous to believe, her calves fattening up dramatically as they
rose towards her knees, already thicker than her thighs had been just an hour
before. She puffed and panted as she hiked her skirt past her knee; it was
awfully tight already, and bent over like she was, Kelli was having trouble
breathing. The way she gasped for breath was strangely arousing; as for much weight
as she had gained already, she couldn't possibly have been more than two
hundred fifty pounds; and I could just imagine her by the time she'd truly had
her fill tipping the scale at double- no, triple her present size- so
helplessly voluptuous that just getting from the bedroom to the kitchen and
back would leave her exhausted and out of breath, nearly trapped in bed, every
last shred of clothing stripped off to help keep cool, naked, chest heaving,
and desperate for my touch.


 


Kelli managed to work her skirt up a little higher; I could
hear stitches snapping in protest as she bared an ever-growing vista of her
exquisitely-bolstered figure. Her thighs were spectacular; nowhere near as
immense as Chrissie's, to be sure, but at least twice as broad as I remembered,
sleek, pale, and, from the way that Kelli's gripping fingers sank into their
surface, soft and pliable in the extreme.


 


�Mmm, so- do you- like what you've seen so far?� Kelli asked
flirtatiously, struggling still to catch her breath, �If my skirt weren't quite
so tight- ooh, I could really give you a show- but that'll just have to wait
until later- whether that means back at the apartment- or just until you feed
me enough to make be explode out of my clothes- is going to be up to you-�


 


I could hardly wait. I reached for another muffin, imagining
Kelli growing fatter and fatter until she really did burst out of her clothes,
pale, shivering, and ready, when I was distracted by the sound of heavy
footsteps against the tile floor as Chrissie sauntered up to our table.


 


�Well, has everything been satisfactory tonight?� she asked
solicitously, reaching into her cleavage and producing a notepad and pen,
�Would you like me to run off and fetch you a box to take the rest of that home
in while you're getting your wallet out? I promise everything we bake will be
every bit as potent tomorrow morning as it is tonight.�


 


�What? Sorry, no, we're not getting up to leave just yet,�
Kelli hastily assured her, trying to readjust her skirt for a bit more modesty
and plopping herself down in her chair, �I was just, um, you know, showing off
what your cooking can do for a girl's figure; I was thinking we'd be at least
another hour before we're ready for the check. That's okay right? I mean,
you've got plenty of tables open still; if you've got some kind of rule about
it I can totally order a cup of coffee or maybe a pie or two.�


 


�It's not that at all,� Chrissie said with an indulgent smile
as she gestured towards the rest of the bakery, which was quite empty except
for us, �It's just that we close a little early when my boss, Mara, is out of
town and I've got the whole place to run all by myself, and it's time for me to
shut the place down for the night. Sorry, I try to get the word out on Facebook and everything for all our regulars, but there are
usually one or two newbies that don't get the news in
time. We'll be open tomorrow in time for lunch, I promise. And besides, if you
take home the rest of those muffins and eat them, I bet you'll put on at least
another two hundred pounds- maybe two fifty- in all the most delightful
places.�


 


�Wait, we're moving away tomorrow morning,� Kelli pleaded, �I
don't know when we'll be back and we- I don't think I can force myself to leave
after just having tasted everything you have to offer. Do you have anything
you're just going to throw out tonight? I'll pay full price for it if you let
us take it home, just as long as it works like these muffins do.�


 


�Oh, sweetie, I'm afraid I didn't whip up quite my usual
supply since I knew we'd be closing down early,� Chrissie explained
sympathetically, �I mean, I might have a few things back in the fridge that I
could wrap up for you, but I've got a feeling you're craving a bit more than
just that tonight.� 


 


�Yes, please,� Kelli insisted, rising to her feet and looking
Chrissie deep in the eye, barely an inch between their chests, �I know this
probably sounds crazy, but ever since I heard of you, or this place, I haven't
been able to get it out of my head. I want to gain more- I need it- I don't
think I can be satisfied until I'm every inch as gorgeously self-indulgent as
you!�


 


�And you want to gain that much weight all in one evening?�
Chrissie said, stepping back with a nervous giggle, though something in her
voice held an echo of respect, �Not a lot of girls can handle that much all in
one sitting, and I don't have nearly enough in the larder to fill you up to my
size, but I do enjoy watching a woman test herself, and I guess I'll be here
for another hour or so anyway cleaning out the cr�me tank anyway- Oh! Hang on a
second-�


 


�Why? What is it?� Kelli asked eagerly.


 


�Just an idea, if you're up for it,� Chrissie said with a
smile, �I might be able to help you get a bit more buxom tonight after all, if
you're feeling adventurous.�


 


�Oh, yes, anything you tell me to do,� Kelli agreed, almost
too enthusiastically.


 


�And how about you?� Chrissie said,
turning her attention towards me, �Do you trust me to take good care of your
little wife here and return her to you in a condition that both of you will be
pleased with, even if it does take some growing used to?�


 


�I just support whatever she wants to do if it makes her
happy,� I said, before Chrissie's piercing stare compelled me to be more
forthcoming, �And yeah, not to sound weird or anything, but if Kelli walks out
of here even half the size you are, that would be pretty incredible.�


 


�Well then, it's settled,� Chrissie said, like genie
preparing to grant an unusually large wish, �You come with me and we'll see
just how much of your fantasy I can fulfill in the next hour or so, and *you*,
just wait here; there are some things that us girls need a little privacy to
work on properly. Try to be patient; I promise she'll be worth the wait.�
