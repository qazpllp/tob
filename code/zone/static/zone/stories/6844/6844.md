ROOMMATES: ALTERNATE UNIVERSE

\*\*\*A Note For Newcomers\*\*\*

For those who have never heard or read about Roommates, I highly
recommend looking into it.

This was a story written based on the characters originally brought to
life by 99Breaker and CRUBAT.

CRUBAT was an incredible help throughout the writing of this long
running series of stories that spanned over 5 years.

Its a project I am incredibly proud of, and I\'m happy to share it here
in full.

Check them out and support them. Without them and their encouragement, I
would\'ve never gone forward with this.

Enjoy!

CH 1: WELCOME TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD\
\
"Alright Niss, I\'m out. I\'ll see you when I get back. We can go up to
the gym then." Nissa looked up at her busty blue haired friend and
nodded, her peach locks bobbing slightly. \
\
"Have fun at Danny Ds." Sakura scoffed a bit\
\
"Yeah, well\...I\'ll try I guess. Enjoy your day off Niss." Nissa gave
Sakura her trademark sweet-as-honey smile in response.\
\
"Won\'t be as fun here without you though, Kura. Is Mano still asleep?"
Sakura nodded and sighed.\
\
"Yeah, knowing her lazy bones. Either that or she\'s doing\...other
stuff in there. I dunno, I knocked and she grunted something. She must
be busy. I wouldn\'t bug her." Nissa nodded and waved at her friend as
she closed the door. As soon as the door shut, she made her way over to
the remote. She turned on the TV watched her favorite program.\
\
After the program had ended, she shut the TV off, and went over to the
stereo. She hit the power button, then  turned the channel knob, finding
her favorite pop channel. Bobbing around the house, swaying her wide
hips left and right. She jiggled and shook, her E cup breasts wobbling
about in her loose pink T-shirt. Her stretched booty shorts managed to
cover her only to her upper thigh. Usually Nissa wouldn\'t be caught
dead in such a wardrobe, but it was her day off, and she was comfortable
like this in her home. She wanted to let loose a bit, letting her hips
wobble back and forth, her impressive bubble butt hopping up and down to
the beat of the song. The cotton white booty shorts made slight creaks,
protesting at the presence of her two foot wide hips. \
\
She began singing along, her lovely singing voice matching along side
the singer on the radio. If anything, she sounded better than whoever
the heck they had. After five or ten more songs, a commercial played,
and Nissa decided it was time to rest. She flopped onto the couch, her
CD sized jugs knocking against her chin briefly, then settling upon her
ribcage.\
\
"Whew. Not a bad workout." She smiled, satisfied with her self contained
party. She looked over at Mano\'s bedroom door, which she could see from
the living room. "I hope I\'m not bothering Mano though\..." Just then,
she saw a bag of some kind on the table, out of the corner of her eye. A
small, green plastic bag had appeared, as if from nowhere. "Hmm? I
didn\'t notice that\...did Sakura buy something yesterday and not tell
me about it?" She plucked it up from the table gently and looked at it.\
\
"Ooh! Candy!" Nissa said with an excitable grin. She went to open it,
but stopped. "Hmm\...Kura might have gotten it for herself\..." She
thought for a moment, eying over the package. It seemed to be a packet
of small, cube-shaped gummy candies. All sorts of flavors. Strawberry,
Cherry, Peach, Mango, and Watermelon. Nissa held them for a while, eying
them nervously, trying to hold back temptation, but it was just too
great.\
\
"Hmmm\...I don\'t think Kura would mind if I just had\...one or two\..."
With that thought, it was settled. Nissa took the bag by the sides and
made a small tear, looking inside the package. After close inspection,
she saw that the only flavors were pink and yellow-orange. She looked at
the flavor key.\
\
"Aww, only watermelon and peach? Hmph\...oh well. They should still be
tasty!" She said as she pulled one of each flavor out and popped them
into her mouth. She rolled the gummies around in her mouth a few times
before chewing into them. As soon as her teeth bit into their surface,
they exploded with flavor. Nissa\'s eyes lit up, her body tensing for a
split second before relaxing onto the couch. "Mmm\...wow, these are
amaaaazing\..." Nissa said, her mouth still finishing off the flavorful
sweets. They tingled in her mouth for a moment, and she looked down at
the bag, the small colorful cubes calling out for her to consume them.
"\...I\'m sure Sakura wouldn\'t mind if I just had\...a few more\..."
She pulled out a few more, this time eating one at a time. One
watermelon, its juicy and sweet taste spiking inside of her mouth. She
smiled and chewed, wiggling her huge butt a bit in her seat as she
relished in the flavor. Soon she popped the peach one into her mouth,
then she absentmindedly picked up another small handful. Then another.
And another. \
\
No time seemed to pass as Nissa swiftly savored the juicy confections.
She then looked back into the bag and stopped in place, noticing
something.\
\
"Oh shoot! I ate so many! Half the bag is gone\...!" She inspected it
further, noticing that all the cubes left had the same yellow-orange
color. "And there\'s only peach left! Oh, I messed up! Bad Nissa!" She
hung her head, and sat the candies back onto the coffee table. She stood
and began sulking over to her room, disappointed in herself for losing
control over her appetite. She threw herself chest-first onto her bed,
her perky E-cups being the first thing to land, her juicy backside
jiggling furiously for a few seconds after she had settled. She lay
there for a few moments, but quickly rolled onto her back.\
\
"Hmm\...I should make it up to her! Yeah! I\'ll just go down to the
store and get her some more! Maybe find some coconut ones, if they have
any\...she would like those\..." Nissa stood and went to her closet, a
confident smile back on her face, ready to pick out her outfit for the
outdoors, when suddenly\...an odd feeling started to pulse throughout
her body. "Ooh\...what in the world\...?" Nissa took a glance down at
her body, stepping away from her closet. A gurgle was starting to pick
up in her stomach, and she placed her hands gingerly upon it, rubbing
slightly. "Hungh\...I must\'ve eaten too many\...I suppose that\'s what
I get for\...oof\..." She clenched her eyes in pain as a sensation
quickly spread from her stomach and throughout her entire body. She
began shaking a little as the pain soon turned into a pleasant tingle.
Her grip on her stomach softened, and she brought her hands back down to
her sides. "What\'s\...going on\...?" She asked herself softly. \
\
The answer made itself clear. The tingle was soon starting to turn into
a warm, pleasant heat, centering on two areas: her breasts and booty.
She brought a hand up to her left breast and gingerly held it. As soon
as it made contact with her pink shirt, which sank onto the bare flesh
of her breast, she let out a gasp, a soft spike of pleasure pulsing
throughout her. "Oh\...oh what is that\..." Nissa did her best to figure
out what was going on, but no answers came to her. The heat continued to
build, and the tingling feeling escalated to almost\...pleasurable.
"Oooh\..." \
\
Nissa\'s eyes widened and she brought her hand quickly up to her mouth.
Did she just\...moan? She looked quickly back down to her body. Each
breath seemed to lift her chest into her shirt. Up and down\...up and
down\...up and\...up\...and\...\
\
"OH MY GOODNESS!" Nissa yelped as she watched her bosom slowly rising
behind her loose pink t-shirt, taking up more and more space by the
second. Her once big but manageable E-cups began to swell up further
into F-cups, getting even more enormous. Nissa was at a loss for words.
All she could do was watched wide-eyed at her bosom as it grew
bigger\...and bigger\...and bigger\...and\...\
\
"WAAAHHHH!" Nissa let out another panicked scream as she felt a shooting
stream of pleasure shoot into her butt. Waggling her bottom slightly,
swinging it right left, right left, she felt it begin to jiggle along in
time\...but also, in another way as well. She flipped her head to look
behind herself, only to see her butt puffing up by the second. "Not you
too! Ohh\...no\...oh no! Sakura! Mano! I need\...helllllp\...!" She
mumbled as her breasts hit G cups and continued, getting as big as
softballs. She brought her hands to her bottom and squeezed, forgetting
the episode from before, and felt the same familiar pleasure shock
ricochet through her insides. It forced another moan out of her, Nissa
beginning to sweat a bit under all the sensations racking her body. She
fell to her knees, her plump rear squashing into the back of her thighs,
continuing its assault into her tight white shorts. Her shirt soon
became skin-tight, the threads now beginning to let out soft creaks in
protest of her new sweater meat. \
\
She felt a grumble begin to form in her bosom. Then, it also started in
her ass. "Unnhh\...what\...what is thAAAHH-" She had her answer as her
breasts rocketed forward 6 inches, getting as big as medicine balls
within seconds. Her ass followed suit, getting even bigger than her
titanic tits, her hips widening and her thighs getting thicker to
accommodate her juicy ass flesh. "Nonononononono!" Nissa shook her head
as both sides of her resumed their growth. She bit her lip and shut her
eyes tight, the sensations still racking her body. "Stoooop\..." She
could only sit there and feel the growth consume her body as her breasts
swelled further and further, her body being lifted up by her incredibly
supple and puffy booty\...\
\
Just then, the front door opened, Sakura entering the living room. \
\
"Jesus\...what a day\..." She walked over to the kitchen table, kicking
off her white tennis shoes and leaning over. Just as it seemed her boobs
couldn\'t hang enough, a river of change and coins began to pour from it
like lemonade from a pitcher, into the jar in front of her. Even with
the thought of this being quite a bit of currency for one day, Sakura
still wore a face of annoyance. "Just HAD to play \'boobsketball\'
today, didn\'t they, those drunken\..." she continued to mumble grumpily
to herself as she noticed something out of the corner of her eye. A
little green bag of some kind. \
\
As soon as her cleavage was empty of all the bulky change, she dipped
her hand in to do one final check within her glorious G cups, then
jiggled her boobs a bit to make sure there were no stragglers hanging
on, doing one final inspection. She removed the last of her tips. Bills
of varying quantities. Ones, fives, tens, and a twenty. "Well\...someone
was generous\..." Sakura said with a sarcastic bitterness. Her trademark
Danny Ds t-shirt now free from any of the offending change, she bent
down to her tube socks, drawn up past her knees, and removed a few more
bills that she had stuffed down them herself. She let out a sigh. "Not a
bad day, I suppose\..." She then took notice of the green bag once more,
picking it up to inspect it. \
\
"Candy\...? Did Niss buy this or something\...?" She looked around the
living room. "Wait, where is Niss?" She looked down the hallway to see
Nissa\'s door closed. "Hmph\...must be sleeping\...how lazy\...I told
her we were going to the gym today\..." She shrugged and opened the bag,
inspecting the candy within. "Ah well\..." She found only the same
flavor within, yellow-orange cubes and only a small few were inside.
"Aww\...only peach\...? Could\'ve left some other flavors
Niss\...jeez\...oh well, beggars can\'t be choosers, I guess\..." Sakura
leaned the package upwards, letting the last few cubes dump into her
mouth all at once. Chewing as she flopped down onto the couch, her tight
uniform boy-shorts riding up her legs slightly as she took a load off,
she chewed on the candies for a moment, wanting to relax before she got
into her gym clothes. The sweet peach flavor filled her mouth and she
smiled, chewing slowly to truly enjoy the flavors that emitted from the
candies.\
\
"Mmm\...I\'ve never had these before\...I\'ve never even seen them in
the stores\...they must be new\...so good\..." Sakura picked up the
package once more, taking a look at the label. Surprisingly, there was
none. It was merely a green package that said the flavors on the front.
No brand name, no fun little picture, nothing. She flipped it on the
back and found no nutritional facts, no ingredients. She raised a
suspicious eyebrow. "That\'s\...weird\..." She shrugged and continued to
enjoy the candy, tossing the empty packaging aside. She swallowed,
letting out a light "ahh!" as her sign of approval. "Now\...to get
sleepy head from out of bed\...we really need to work out more to get
that butt of hers under contro-" She stopped midstep and felt a rush of
some sort hit her. A gurgling filled her stomach. She paused and looked
down. "Oooh\...man, were those poisoned or something\...?" \
\
Suddenly, she heard a rustling noise, as well as muffled moans, coming
from the other end of the hall. She walked over to the opening of the
hall and looked down it. \
\
"Nissa? Is that you?" Sakura asked, staring down at the other end of the
hall. She saw Nissa\'s door open. But all she could make out of in the
doorway were two large, bright pink-and-flesh colored orbs, squishing
into the wood frame. Sakura merely stared at it in confusion for a
moment, until\...\
\
"K-KURA?! IS THAT YOU?!" Nissa\'s timid but frantic voice sounded out
from behind the two massive spheres in the doorway. Kura was
dumbstruck.\
\
"Holy shit Niss\...what happened to you?"\
\
"I\...I don\'t know! I need help! Hurrry\~" Nissa mewed a bit in her
sentence. Sakura sighed a little at her friend, thinking she had gotten
caught into yet another one of Mano\'s magical bust-enhancing traps. \
\
"I swear, if she is behind this, she\'s gonna seriously pay\...its the
fifth time this week!" Kura went over, grabbing onto the supple flesh of
Nissa\'s over-inflated jugs. She heard a soft moan come from the other
side of the wall of boob, and she chuckled slightly. "Don\'t get too
excited on me, ok Niss?" Even from the other side, Kura could predict
that Nissa\'s face was probably as red as an apple. \
\
"I-I\'m s-s-sorry Kura\...its just\...it feels\...weird\..."\
\
"You mean \'good\'?" Sakura teased her a bit as she pulled on her boobs
hard. After a few seconds of pushing from Niss and pulling from Kura,
there was a definitive \*POP!\*, and Nissa fell forward, Kura falling
onto her rear. But Niss only made it about two inches forward before
becoming stuck again. She looked behind her.\
\
"Oh\...come on\..." Sakura laughed again, then brought her hand up to
her forehead.\
\
"Jeez Niss\...now we\'re REALLY gonna have to go to the gym after
this\...ahaha!"\
\
"Kura! Shuuuush! I need heeeelp!" Nissa continued to half-whine,
half-moan as she wagged her butt inside the door frame, trying to get it
free. Kura got around her titanic, and still growing, boobs, and grasped
onto her just as massive tush. After a few pulls, there was another
\*POP!\*, and Nissa came tumbling down on top of Kura\'s plump thighs,
her beach ball sized boobs squishing into her. \
\
"Niss\...you\'re gonna have to get up at some point\..." Nissa shook her
head out of her daze, then began pushing herself off of Kura, and
waddled her way into the living room. Sakura made her way over to her,
studying her up and down.\
\
"Jeez\...they\'re still going too\...any idea how this happened?" Nissa
cocked her head to one side and brought a single index finger to her
chin and thought.\
\
"Umm\..." Sakura pinched the bridge of her nose, but still chuckled a
bit. \
\
"Alright, what have you been doing today?"\
\
"Well\...I watched some TV\...listened to some music\...danced a
little\..."\
\
"Ah! Mano must have put some kind of enchantment on the stereo!" Kura
put the pieces together as she made her way over to the small portable
stereo. \
\
"You think so?" Nissa asked, her shirt and shorts making audible creaks
and groans under the growing pressure of her ballooning assets.\
\
"Pssh\...I wouldn\'t be surprised\..." Kura continued to study it
carefully as Nissa looked around the room, noticing the empty green
package on the ground. \
\
"Oh! I also had some candy today! Was it yours? If it is, I\'m sorry I
ate so many. I couldn\'t help myself!"\
\
"That\'s alright, Niss, I know how you are about swee-" Kura stopped
mid-sentence, what Nissa had said taking a second to sink in.
"Wait\...what\...candy\...?" Nissa pointed to the package on the ground.
Sakura looked at it, then at Nissa, then at herself.
"Oh\...God\...please don\'t be tha-" Her eyes went wide and her hands
flew back to her posterior as she felt it start to tingle.\
\
"Shit. Shit. SHIT! NO! IT WAS THE CANDY!" Sakura groaned as she felt her
butt slowly billowing outwards into her tight black uniform
booty-shorts. She rubbed her cheeks up and down as they pushed outwards
into her palms, her soft flesh getting fuller and rounder with every
passing second. "This is bad\...ooohhh\...how big are they gonna get?"
She looked back at Nissa and gawked. Nissa was leaning down on her
breasts, panting heavy as her boobs reached the size of yoga balls, and
her ass being the size of large beach balls, her wide hips and thighs
all keeping up the pace along side them. "Oh\...well that\'s\...not
good\..." \
\
More and more, her butt swelled and pushed outwards, and she began to
hear a soft \* shriip \* sound. "No\...not my shorts!" Kura worried as
her uniform shorts began to tear at the seams in the wake of her
volleyball sized cheeks. \
\
Suddenly there was a sharp sound of tearing clothes as Nissa\'s shirt
finally became nothing more than shreds. \
\
"GYAAAAAAH!!" Nissa shouted, attempting to bring her hands to her
nipples, but they were too distant for her to reach. A worried and
embarrassed look on her face, she looked over at Sakura, whose butt was
still growing at a breakneck pace. It was soon so big, Kura could no
longer stand. She flopped onto her backside with an "oof" and sat there,
a grumpy look on her face. "Wh\...what do we do now Kura\...?" Nissa
asked, a hint of desperateness in her voice. Sakura sat in silence, her
eyes closed in frustration as one of her eyebrows twitched. Then, she
let out a scream.\
\
"MANO! GET YOUR ASS OUT HERE RIGHT NOOOOOOW!" \
\
As if on cue, Mano\'s door burst open, and the mischievous red-haired
deviant came sauntering out into the living room. Unlike her now
ludicrously proportioned roommates, Mano boasted very little in her
proportions: average D cups and very little curve in her backside. She
wore a sly grin on her pale face, wearing her black yoga pants and
maroon tank top.\
\
"Yeeeesss?\~" Mano asked innocently in a sing-song sort of way. She
snickered when she made it to the center of the room, looking back and
forth between Nissa, her ass and breasts about the size of her whole
body, and Sakura, who was not far off from Nissa in terms of booty. "Oh
wow! That stuff really worked! I didn\'t know they would get this big!
Holy shit!" Mano let out a long laugh as Sakura gave her a deathly
glare.\
\
"I knew you had something to do with this\..." Sakura mumbled. Mano got
up to her face and patted her on the huge bottom.\
\
"Oh?" Mano stuck out her tongue. Nissa moaned as her breasts continued
to rub across the floor with their growth.\
\
"Can you make it stop now Mano\...for Christ\'s sake\...I think we\'ve
gotten big enough\..." Mano stepped over to Nissa and pressed both her
hands into her large flesh pillows. Nissa let out a moan, trying her
best to repress the naughty noises emitting from her.\
\
"Manoooo! Stoooop!" Nissa pleaded, feeling Mano tease her boobs with her
fingers. Mano merely snickered again and backed up from her. \
\
"Why do you ladies look so upset? You always seemed to love your boobs
and booties so damn much\...I give you even more to love and you just
seem to get so damn upset\..." She shook her head and let out a soft
"tsk, tsk, tsk".\
\
"I\'ve never asked to be bigger than what I already have, Mano, dammit!
I\'ve told you over and over again, I\'m JUST FINE with how big I
am\...or how big I WAS, I guess\..." Mano snapped her fingers, and both
women felt their bodies come to a halt. Nissa and Sakura let out a sigh
of relief.\
\
"God, you are NO fun! No fun at all!"\
\
"FUN?! Messing with our bodies behind out backs is supposed to be fun?!"
Mano let out a laugh.\
\
"It is for me! Haha! Look at these things! They\'re so soft looking\..."
She began lifting one of Nissa\'s massive breasts, then dropped it,
letting it jiggle uncontrollably. \
\
"Ooof! Don\'t touch them Mano, please\..." Nissa cried out in protest.
She began to turn a shade of red, and Mano noticed this.\
\
"Feeling hot, Miss Niss? I can help with that, you know\..." Mano
snapped her fingers and suddenly, a small bucket filled with ice
appeared. Nissa saw it and started shaking her head. Mano grinned and
took out an ice cube, chucking it deep into Nissa\'s wide expanse of
cleavage. \
\
"EEP!" Nissa jostled slightly, still rendered immobile by her immense
masses. Mano chucked in another, then another, seeing Nissa\'s giant tit
flesh undulate with each landing of an ice cube. After a few more, she
then went and flipped the bucket over, all the ice cascading onto
Nissa\'s enormous bosom.\
\
"AHHHHHH!!" Nissa let out a loud, but adorable yelp of protest as the
ice cubes plopped down onto her breasts. She began to shiver a bit as
the ice cubes started to melt into her flesh.\
\
"Mano! Cut it out! Stop messing with her!" Mano shot Sakura a glare,
then cracked a smile, walking over to her while pulling out her cell
phone.\
\
"Aww, you jealous Kura?" Sakura growled at Mano slightly as Mano looked
over at the table. She saw the jar of change, as well as Sakura\'s cell
phone. She deftly grabbed both in one fell swoop, and looked back at
Sakura\'s engorged badonk. \
\
"Don\'t\...you\...dare\..." Sakura threatened, knowing well she was in
no position to make threats. Mano paused for a moment, looking at
Sakura\'s overly-taxed booty shorts, on the verge of falling to shreds.
She shrugged, then pulled forward the fabric as far as she could (which
wasn\'t that far), hearing it tear a bit more on the sides. With that,
she dumped all of Sakura\'s earnings for the day down her shorts, and
quickly threw down her cell phone as well, snapping the waistband back
down onto her booty. "MANO! You\'re SO gonna pay for this!" Mano held up
a finger as she pulled out her cell phone.\
\
"Hold on, I gotta make a call real quick\..." She dialed and waited,
until suddenly, a rattling vibration started emitting from Sakura\'s
shorts. Her ass jiggled and wobbled from the vibration in rhythm to the
ring. \
\
"STOP! OOOOOH THAT FEELS SO\...." Mano let out a long laugh as she
continued her call, listening as the change trapped between her shorts
and a soft place let out a soft jingle. Sakura wiggled involuntarily as
the vibration persisted unabated. \
\
\* knock, knock, knock \*\
\
Mano\'s laughter and tormenting was interrupted by a knock on the door.\
\
"Who the hell could that be\...?" Mano wondered. She put down the phone,
Sakura letting out a labored breath as her butt came to a slow jiggly
halt. Mano stepped around the two giant masses of flesh that were Nissa
and Sakura and made her way to the door, slowly opening it. After
peeking through the crack she opened, she fully swung the door ajar,
seeing that no one was there.\
\
"Grr\...damn pranksters\..." Mano slammed the door and turned around,
back to her plumped up proteges. What she saw took her by surprise.\
\
"Well, well, well\..." A woman lounged on one of Nissa\'s massive boobs.
She was tall, a bit taller than Sakura was when she could stand. She
wore glasses, and had her dark red hair in a ponytail. Dawning a black
and red corset, she tapped her one of her feet against the floor,
breaking the dumbstruck silence. "Its\...Mano, isn\'t it?" Mano just
stared for a moment, unclear of what was going on.\
\
"Wh\...what the\...who the hell are you? How did you get into our
home?!" Mano shouted in shock. The woman stood from Nissa\'s fleshy
mattress sized breast. \
\
"My name, my dear Mano, is Tiffany." Mano stepped back over to the
woman, making her way back over to the living room, keeping her eye on
the woman the whole time. Sakura and Nissa sat there in silence, unsure
of what to do now that a stranger had invaded their home.\
\
"What business do you have here?" Mano said with a point of her index
finger. Tiffany pointed back.\
\
"You, my dear. You are my business today." Mano stared at her blankly.
"Let me explain a bit of who I am." She took a seat on the much more
conventional chair in the living room. "I am what we call a
\'spellcrafter\'. My job, in a nutshell, is to create magical spells
that wizards, warlocks, and witches, such as yourself, can use\...for a
price." She picked up the wrapper from the floor and levitated it,
twirling it just above her hand. "I created almost every single bodily
enhancement that you have ever used. That anyone has ever used. No
matter how easy or complex, whether it be a tome, charm, spell, potion,
enchantment, you name it, I made it." The wrapper slowly crumpled into a
ball. She gently tossed it over her shoulder. Mano continued to stare at
her, not sure of what to think.\
\
"How is that even possible\...?" Tiffany let out an soft laugh.\
\
"I may not look it dear, but I am older than your grandmother. Your
grandmother's grandmother, more likely. Hell, maybe even her
grandmother." Mano gaped at this. This woman looked like she was the
exact same age as her and her friends. "Now then, the reason why I am
here\...may I ask why you are abusing my magic on such a frequent
basis?"\
\
"A\...abusing? How am I abusing it?" Mano said, flabbergasted at
Tiffany\'s sudden switch of attitude.\
\
"Well, my dear, I can sense when a large amount of my magic is being
used in a particular location. You see, my magic is a part of me, a part
of my soul. I can sense when it is being over-used\...and it has been
done so in spades when it comes to these ladies right here\..." She
gestured towards the bloated bodies of Sakura and Nissa. "You see\...its
alright if someone abuses my magic, as long as they eventually learn
their lesson from it, or if it is by complete mistake. That is
understandable. But you\...you know what you are doing to these poor
girls. And you never learn any better of it." Mano scoffed.\
\
"Pfft! What is there to learn? First of all, these are my friends, they
don\'t mind if we\...have a little fun once in a while."\
\
"At our expense\...?" Sakura said, still a bit breathless.\
\
"Shush!" Mano quipped back. Tiffany gave Mano a harsh glare. \
\
"Its usually none of my business what happens to magic when it is sold
from my store\...from there its buyer beware\...but\..." Tiffany took a
look at both Nissa and Sakura. Kura could see a flash of sympathy appear
in Tiffany\'s eyes, as if old memories came to surface for a brief
moment. "\...this is unacceptable. As the creator of this magic, I
won\'t let it be abused\..." \
\
"What kind of shitty business model is that? Car dealers don\'t care if
you crash their cars, why should you care if I\'m-"\
\
"THAT\'S ENOUGH!" Tiffany stood, a sudden outrage behind her voice. Mano
cringed in fear a bit, intimidated by Tiffany\'s powerful aura. Tiffany
let out a sigh, cooling off a bit. "This is my business. I could care
less about the mundane business practices of everyday humans\..." She
stepped towards Mano, who lifted one of her hands in defense, prepared
to cast a spell. \
\
"Don\'t get any closer! I\'m not afraid to use this!" Mano threatened.
Tiffany smirked, then let out a long laugh.\
\
"My dear\...do you really think that any of the magic you use will truly
effect someone like me?" Mano looked back between Nissa, Sakura, the
Tiffany, a bead of sweat forming on her head. She then snapped her
fingers, sending a green spark of magic towards Tiffany. It hit her in
the chest, and there was a moment of silence. Tiffany giggled.\
\
"That tickled!" Mano gave her a harsh stare, then sent another spell
flying, Tiffany smacking it away from her this time, the spell flying
into the couch and dissipating. "That all you got, dear?" Tiffany
teased. Mano growled in frustration, then sent spell after spell,
hurling them into Tiffany. Every one was deflected, sent into odd
angles, Tiffany knowing exactly which ones did what, to where. Suddenly,
Mano sent one out of nowhere, taking Tiffany a bit by surprise. She
deflected it, and it nailed Sakura right in the chest. Mano, Tiffany and
Nissa just stared at her, her already massive G cup breasts beginning to
quiver\...\
\
"Whoops!" Mano said with a facetious tone. They all watched as Sakura\'s
breasts quickly plumped up several more cup sizes. H cup, I cup, J cup,
the size of basketballs in little to no time at all. Tiffany watched and
started to boil in anger as Mano laughed her ass off.\
\
"Alright\...enough of that." Tiffany let out a snap, and a blinding
white flash occurred. Sakura\'s breasts stopped at the size of beach
balls. She turned on her heel to face Mano, a fiery passion of fury in
her eyes. Letting out a quick bolt of energy into the ground, Mano could
do nothing but watch as a pair of hands formed from the carpet beneath
her and took her by the legs.\
\
"HEY! LET GO OF ME!" Mano struggled with the strong grip of the
anomalous hands sticking up from the floor. She then looked back at
Tiffany and raised a finger, preparing another spell. Tiffany once again
snapped her fingers, a blue light emitting from her and flowing into
Mano, who shivered slightly. She tried to retaliate, but found no magic
forming from her fingers. "What\...what the hell? Why can\'t I\...?" She
tried all sorts of spells, but nothing would work. Tiffany let out an
evil chuckle.\
\
"That was a dowsing spell, hun. It negates any and all magic that you
can possibly cast for a set period of time. Now then\..." She stepped up
close to Mano, who had given up her fight with the invincible hands
holding her in place. \
\
"I thought you only did bodily magic\..." Mano sneered.\
\
"I only MAKE bodily magic\...I know much, MUCH more than that, I can
assure you\..." She ran her finger across Mano\'s soft, smooth body.
From her shoulders, down her side and down onto her legs. She let off a
seductive air as she made her way back up, resting her finger on the
center of Mano\'s chest. Mano could do nothing more than watch, her
energy drained. "Let\'s have fun with this one, shall we\...?" Her
finger suddenly radiated a bright yellow light. Mano grunted in response
as a strange warm sensation circulated through her bosom. \
\
"Wh\...what did you do to me\...?" Tiffany stepped back and watched as
Mano\'s hands started to twitch, slowly making their way back up her
body. "What am I\...I\'m not\...doing this\...?" Mano said in confusion
as her hands continued their ascent up her form and began grasping onto
her squeezable, perky D-cups. As soon as they made contact, she threw
her head back and let out a moan. "Oooohhh\...what is\...going on\...?"
Then\...suddenly\...\
\
\* BWOOMP! \*\
\
Mano\'s breasts shot out two inches into her hands in no time at all.
She dropped her hands immediately, studying the effects, looking down
the collar of her tank top. She was stacked. More stacked than she had
ever been. Her cleavage looked incredible. She felt so constricted in
the now very tight tank top, as it now rose a bit from the sudden
expansion, a sliver of her belly now on display. "Oh\...what\...? What
is\...going on\...?" She felt her hands begin to rise again, and she
took notice, thrusting them back down. \
\
Tiffany let out a laugh.\
\
"You figured that out pretty quick! Guess you\'re not as airheaded as
you seem!" Tiffany stepped over and poked one of her now swollen
breasts. Mano let out a gasp, but was relieved when no expansion
occurred. "Only when under the influence of your own fingers, my dear.
Let\'s see how good your resolve is. In the meantime\..." She turned to
face Sakura, obviously exhausted from all the growing she had done
today. Tiffany studied her for a moment, rubbing her hands softly across
her flesh in an investigatory manner. "Ah, I know what did this\..."
Tiffany muttered to herself. "She put a hex on an edible\...an advanced
one at that\...but still rather primitive compared to some of my other
ones\..." She heard a slightly nervous squeal as Mano\'s hands started
shakily hovering towards her bosom. "Easy fix!" She waved her hands over
Sakura\'s bottom.\
\
In a matter of seconds, Kura\'s bottom began to deflate almost
instantaneously, losing a whole foot in a matter of seconds, in her hips
and thighs as well. Next was her boobs, which took a different reversal
spell. After it was cast, they also began to shrink down to smaller
proportions. She made her way over to Nissa.\
\
"SHIT! UNNNHH!!" Tiffany turned her head to see Mano grabbing onto her
now G cup breasts. She chuckled again.\
\
"Almost there, dear. Almost\..." She faced Nissa, casting a similar
reversal spell onto Nissa and watching as her breasts and ass reduced by
inches. Inches became feet as she returned to a much more manageable
size.\
\
"Th\...thank you\...Tiffany, was it?" Nissa asked breathlessly, standing
from her kneeling position.\
\
"Yes indeed, my dear. It was a pleasure\..." There was a glint of
mischief in her eyes, but Nissa and Sakura took no notice to this.\
\
Meanwhile, Mano had ballooned up to H cups, her cleavage spilling out of
the neck of her shirt, straining it to the max.\
\
"YOU BITCH! TURN ME BACK TO NORMAL!" Mano shouted as she whipped her
hands away from her breasts. Tiffany turned to her and wagged her finger
to her face. \
\
"Mm, mm, mmm! That\'s not how it works! You need to learn a lesson my
dear, and that is the best way I know to teach them\...but just in
case\..." She snapped her fingers once more, the hands of the floor
disappearing. But before Mano could compose herself, a strike of
pleasure coursed through her, and she went glassy eyed. Her mouth opened
wide, but no sound came out. Her breasts surged forward a few more
inches, getting to the size of J cups. She collapsed to the ground,
laying softly on her brand new chest pillows.\
\
Nissa and Sakura laughed, but couldn\'t help but feel slightly worried
about their friend.\
\
"Is she\...going to be ok\...?" Asked Nissa.\
\
"She\'ll be fine Niss\..." Sakura said, stepping over to her. She handed
her a t shirt that was lying on the nearby couch. Nissa quickly donned
it, covering her bosom, when she noticed something\...off\...\
\
"Hmm\...I still feel a little\...big\..." She said, wiggling her butt a
bit, watching it jiggle around. Tiffany snapped and they both suddenly
were decent, covered up on both the top and the bottom. Sakura looked at
her, puzzled.\
\
"Why didn\'t you do that before I\...?" Tiffany shrugged.\
\
"Came to mind when you gave her the shirt." Sakura nodded, studying her
body. She too thought something was slightly off.\
\
"Yeah, I agree Niss\...I still feel kind of\...bloated."\
\
"Oh, that\'s because I didn\'t take it all off, dears." Nissa and Sakura
both looked at her in shock.\
\
"What?!" They both asked in unison. Tiffany snickered at their
reaction.\
\
"Well, my dears, even though I do sympathize with your plight, my
services do not come free. So, if you want to work the rest of what you
have off, as well as pay off for the magic that I provided you, I\'m
going to have to ask you to work for me, at my antique shop. I just
opened up, actually, and I need all the help I can get." She winked at
them both, then made her way to the door, telling them the address. "And
I expect to see you there dears\...or else the effects of my reversal
will wear off and it will be\...very permanent, I\'m afraid\..." Nissa
and Sakura both stared at her, unsure of whether they should be thankful
or fearful. They looked back over at Mano, her over-inflated tits
lifting her off the floor slightly. They then looked back over at
Tiffany.\
\
"Well\...erm\...welcome to the neighborhood then!" Nissa said
cheerfully, with a slight tremble to her voice. Tiffany smiled and waved
at them.\
\
"Thank you dears. I expect to see you bright and early tomorrow morning
at my store. 8:00. Understand?" They both nodded as she snapped her
fingers, disappearing into a cloud of dust.\
\
Nissa studied herself, her breasts somewhere around a G cup, and her
booty two inches wider and larger than it usually was. She let out a
sigh. She looked back at Sakura, who was now hefting what now looked to
be a pair of I cups, perky, but still very soft looking, they were
slightly larger than her head, around bowling ball sized. They both
sighed at their predicament. Sakura shurgged.\
\
"Well, at least we got someone at our side." She slapped Nissa on the
behind, and Nissa went red, letting out an "eep!". "And who knows? We
may finally be able to get that butt of yours under control! Haha!"
Nissa looked at her friend and let out a soft giggle of her own. \
\
"Grgg\..." Mano groaned and lifted herself up slightly from the ground,
only to slam back onto the floor from the weight of her titanic tits.
"Fuck\...these are heavy\..." Sakura stepped over to Mano with ease, her
breasts bobbing back and forth, their weight seeming to have no effect
on the blue haired babe.\
\
"Yeah, well now you know how it feels, don\'t you?" Mano grumbled, then
looked up from her shelf of a bust. \
\
"When I get a hold of that Tiffany woman\...she\'s gonna pay\...big
time\..." Just then, the ever so slight sound of small footsteps entered
the room. At the end of the hall stood the half foot tall imp Crubat,
his batlike face facing Mano\'s unmoving cleavage, larger than he had
ever seen before. He looked back over at Nissa and saw her now
exaggerated hourglass figure, then at Sakura, who was almost bursting at
the seams in her tight uniform tank top, the Danny Ds logo almost
obscured beyond recognition.\
\
Moments passed as the girls stared at the Imp, and he stared back. He
suddenly left the room without word\
\
"That\'s weird, he usually says some stupid-\"\
\
Crubat reappeared, this time wearing a tiny snorkel.\
\
\"Stand back\" He announced, holding both wings outwards towards Mano\'s
helpless tits. \"I\'m going in\" \
\
CH 2: Tiffany\'s Shop of Oddities

\*\*Day 1: Welcome In\*\*\
\
"You gotta be kidding me with these things\..." Mano awoke with a groan,
her gigantic breasts piled on top of her, making it hard to breathe. Her
J-cup monsters, as big as basketballs, kept her pinned to the bed for a
moment. "Fuck, these are heavy\..." Mano muttered as she mustered up the
strength in her arms and back to lift herself into a sitting position.
She succeeded, her breasts looming only inches from her lap. She sighed,
jiggling them up and down with her hands for a moment. "A day in the
life of Kura, I guess\...how fun it is, being the tit monster\..." she
said with a scoff, rotating herself so her legs hung off the bed, her
breasts flopping about inside her pajama top. It had only been one day
since Tiffany had paid a visit. Mano was not even close to used to them
yet.\
\
She stood, then almost immediately fell flat onto her plush bosom with
an "oof!" She sat there for a moment, her head resting on her palm as
her other hand rapped its fingers against her soft flesh, sending
ripples across the surface of her boobs. "When I get my hands on that
Tiffany bitch\...she is SO gonna get it!" She stood as well as she
could, wobbling slightly over to her bookshelf, poring over the various
spell books and tomes to find the solution to her situation.\
\
"Gotta be something\...think, Mano\..." She racked her brain for a
minute, then finally, the spell came to mind. "Of course! Ehehee\...the
reversal leech\...its a tough one\..." she muttered to herself as she
pulled out the book it was in. She took careful wobbled steps back over
to her bed and sat, opening the book to the proper page. "Aha! There we
are\...reversal leech\...time to get some of this off of me and onto
someone else\...just gotta imagine them\..." She thought for a moment,
wanting to put it onto Tiffany. Her eyebrow twitched. "Probably not the
best idea\...she would probably like it anyways\..." She looked at the
book again, then a devilish grin crossed her face. "\...the person with
the monster tits around here should be Kura\...that\'s how its always
been, anyways\..." She imagined Sakura in her head, with boobs larger
than her own. A green light began to emit from the book.\
\
"Yes! Work your magic!" Mano said with a cheer, bobbing on the bed a
bit, her breasts letting out heavy wobbles in response. Then, suddenly,
just as she thought it would go into effect, it flashed a bright red and
she felt a sudden spike of pleasure hit her bosom. "OHHHH SHIT!" Mano
yelled, collapsing inward and gripping her boobs. They gurgled slightly
for a moment, then suddenly ballooned a cup size, reaching K cups, her
basketballs now overinflated.\
\
"YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDING ME!" Mano shouted to no one.\
\
"I\'m afraid not dear\...hehehe\..." Mano nearly fell off the bed, but
managed to stop herself by some sort of miracle, by gripping the edge of
the bed. There was Tiffany, staring at her from the other side of the
bed.\
\
"How the fuck did you-" Tiffany wagged her finger at her.\
\
"I\'m magic. Do we really need to go through this song and dance again?"
Mano sulked a bit, but kept her evil glare fixated on Tiffany. "Nice try
with that little trick there. You really think I couldn\'t detect you
using MY magic? I swear, I told this to you yesterday, did it not sink
into your thick skull?" Mano reached out to punch her, but whiffed as
Tiffany stood from the bed. Mano collapsed onto her sweater pillows.
Tiffany let out a laugh as she watched Mano struggle to get up.\
\
"You REALLY need to work on dealing with those, dear. Ever wonder how
your blue-haired friend works with them? She\'s had practice. She worked
on her body. That\'s how, even now, she has full control and mobility. I
suggest you start working out or something, hun. Its the only way
you\'ll be able to walk again\...properly. Hehehe\..." She walked
around, Mano still face down on the bed, breasts underneath her body,
her rear stuck up into the air. Tiffany sought the opportunity, Mano\'s
black lace night shirt brought up far enough to reveal her entire
backside, covered only by some black lace panties. She gave it a quick
smack, letting out a seductive snicker.\
\
"UNH! Keep your hands off my ass you bitch!" \
\
"Tch. Dear, I don\'t believe you can be giving orders right now." She
traced her fingers across the slowly forming red mark of her hand on
Mano\'s left butt cheek. Mano waggled it slightly, still trying to heft
herself onto her now sore bottom. "I suggest you get used to the way you
are, my dear. It isn\'t going to go away. Keep trying to fix it and
you\'ll only make it worse. This is your only warning\..." She headed
for the doorway and stood. She turned back to her briefly and smiled. "I
think I\'ll go greet the other girls. Do you mind? Of course you
don\'t." She opened the door and walked out into the living room, seeing
Kura and Nissa already getting ready for the day.\
\
Nissa sat on the couch, putting the finishing touches on her outfit. A
light blue sweater, trying to cover her new busty F-cup figure, as well
as a pink tiered skirt that went to her knees. Sakura was in the
kitchen, finishing up her breakfast, wearing a white tank top, as well
as some black yoga pants. Her breasts seemed especially tight in her
tank top, the cleavage from her engorged I-cups spilling out of the
collar. Both looked over at Tiffany, taken by surprise from her walking
out of Mano\'s room.\
\
"Oh! Uh\...h-hi Miss Tiffany\..." Nissa said nervously, not meeting eye
contact with the spellcrafter. Tiffany let out a light, warm laugh and
waved to them both.\
\
"Hello dears. We ready for the first day of work?" Both smiled and
nodded.\
\
"Ready as we\'ll ever be, I suppose\..." Sakura said nervously.\
\
"Oh you\'ll be fine dears. I know you\'ll be just fantastic to work at
my store\...big assets or not!" She gave a wink and went for their door.
"Let\'s be on our way then." Both of them nodded and followed, walking
over to the store.\
\
A small shop on the corner of a not too distant block from the two
women\'s apartment was their destination.\
\
"Here we are!" Tiffany said in a cheery, sing-songy voice. She opened
the door for the ladies and they stepped in. What they saw was a very
cramped, but common looking antique shop. Various cabinets displaying a
plethora of old-looking trinkets and knick-knacks. The aisles were
formed by the furniture-tables, chairs, vanities, bookshelves, armoires,
and so many more. She waved them past the reception counter near the
front to the center of the store.\
\
"Now, it may look like a lot, dears, but there is a decent organization
to this place." She directed to one small section, crammed full of
merchandise. "I keep a lot of potions and such here." They looked up and
down the little cubby. Vials, small pots and mason jars filled with
various colored liquids filled the shelves and curios. She gestured to
the next section. "This is the jewelry section, lots of valuable stuff
here, so be careful. And keep an eye on it." She pointed to the next
one. "Here we have the bookshelf section\..." She walked over, with
Nissa and Sakura in toe, as they went over to the four rows of
bookshelves. The shelves were taller than all of them by a good foot,
and they went on for a good few yards. "As you see\...I have a lot of
books\..." Sakura and Nissa nodded in wonder, taking in the sheer amount
of written works around them. \
\
"Wowie, you\'ve got your own personal library here!" Nissa said, her
head craning to look upwards to the upper parts of the shelves." Tiffany
nodded.\
\
"You could say that, dear. Its all organized, but needs re-organization
every day. So that\'ll be your first job for the first few days. Helping
me organize these. Now then, still a little bit more to go\..." They
followed her to the next part of the store. "Final section here is the
miscellaneous\..." She lifted up a unicycle to illustrate her point. "I
just keep the things that don\'t fit in the other sections, or in the
various displays in the aisles, here. Works out well enough." They made
their way back to the check-out counter and Tiffany looked at them for a
moment.\
\
"Now then, before we continue too much\...I believe I can help you a bit
for the day. I know that maneuvering can be a bit tricky
with\...generous proportions\...so\..." She snapped her finger and a
purple aura radiated into the room, and soon dissipated. Nissa and
Sakura felt a brief warmth hit them as their breasts and asses both
deflated about an inch, back to their normal sizes.\
\
"Now, this only applies in here, dears. As soon as you exit, the curse
is back on. I\'m going to take it off for good in a week, after I feel
you\'ve paid it off to me. OK?" She looked at them both, the question
more like a statement with no point in rebuking. They both nodded.
Tiffany smiled. "Good. Now then, time for work. I\'ll man the registers,
you two be helpful in the aisles and clean up those bookshelves how I
mentioned before. Alphabetize the best you can, alright?"\
\
"You got it!" Nissa said, bouncing a bit on her feet, happy to have her
old form back. Sakura merely nodded, still a tad bitter for being held
captive in the store by Tiffany, who used her body as currency. But she
just shrugged it off her mind and headed with Nissa over to the
bookshelves. It could be way worse. She wasn\'t stuck laying on boobs
the size of a mattress. So that was nice.\
\
They made their way over and looked over at a stack of books lying near
the bookcase, and began the mundane task of putting them in the right
order. After about an hour, Nissa began to yawn.\
\
"Ugh! Kura, I\'m so boooooooored!" Nissa complained. Sakura nodded.\
\
"Yeah, well, not really that much fun for me either Niss. But its what
we gotta do to pay off our debt to Tiffany. She did save our asses,
after all. Its really the least we can do." Nissa sighed and nodded.\
\
"You\'re right\...as usual\..." Nissa looked at a few of the books,
opening them for a moment and looking inside. "I wonder what\..."\
\
"Don\'t touch those!" Sakura slammed it shut in Nissa\'s hands. Nissa
yelped in shock, looking up at her friend with her bright green eyes.
"Tiffany is a super powerful magical being\...we have no idea what these
books could do to us\...if we\'re not careful, we could\...sprout an
extra pair of arms, or\...turn into a fish, or\..." Sakura\'s mind
drifted to the incident the other day with Mano and shuddered. "Let\'s
just\...focus on putting them away for now\..." Nissa nodded and they
resumed their work\
\
Hours passed. They had their lunch and continued their seemingly
limitless amount of putting book after book onto shelves. The day
finally ended. \
\
"Bye bye dears! Thanks so much for your help!" Tiffany waved them out
kindly. As soon as they stepped foot out of the store, both their
breasts and their asses puffed up an inch, making their clothes creak
and stretch. Nissa felt up her booty with her hands in her now tighter
skirt.\
\
"Oh man\...I don\'t want my bum this big anymore Kura\..." Sakura nodded
and poked her bigger bust.\
\
"I\'m with you there Niss. Just gotta get through the week. Then we\'ll
be back to normal." Nissa nodded and they both headed home to rest up
for the next day at work.\
\
\*\*Day 2: Meet Whit\*\*\
\
"Everything alright dear?" Tiffany called from the end of one of the
tall aisles. Sakura looked back and nodded, continuing her new job for
the day: polishing knick-knacks. \
\
"Yeah. Almost done with this section, then I\'ll be\...halfway done with
my job\...maybe\..." She let out a small sigh. Tiffany noticed this and
stepped over to her, putting a sympathetic hand on her shoulder.\
\
"If you need a break dear\...feel free to do so, alright?" Sakura
nodded, noticing Tiffany\'s genuine smile.\
\
"Thanks\..." She wanted to be suspicious of this behavior, but\...she
couldn\'t be. She watched as Tiffany sauntered off towards the
bookshelves, where Nissa continued to organize various books. Tiffany
had split the two ladies up for the day to see if they could work well
separately. So far, Sakura seemed to be doing well.\
\
Tiffany stepped to the opening of the aisle of bookshelves to see Nissa
reaching up to a high shelf, trying to put a thick, leather-bound book
back. She got high on her tippy-toes, her breasts beginning to push
lightly into the bookshelf. Try as she might, she couldn\'t get it where
she wanted it. She leaned back down and sighed. After a few moments, she
noticed Tiffany out of the corner of her eye.\
\
"Oh! Uh\...hello Tiffany\...I was just\..." Tiffany laughed a bit, and
stepped over to Nissa.\
\
"Dear, if you needed a ladder, just say so. I know you\'re the taller
one out of the bunch, but these shelves are high up even for the average
basketball player." Nissa giggled at this remark as Tiffany snapped her
fingers, a rolling ladder appearing, leaning on the shelf. Nissa jumped
a bit as the faint smoke settled around the object.\
\
"Oh woah! Just like in the movies!" Nissa hopped jovially on her feet,
sending her perky breasts on a jiggle-spree. \
\
"Yes, well\...they have them in real life too, dear\...but anyways, feel
free to use it. Just be careful, alright?" Nissa nodded and climbed onto
it, determined to put the book in her hands in the right spot.\
\
Meanwhile, Sakura was still putting the finishing touches on the
section.\
\
\'Ah, just about there\...\' she thought to herself. \'\...this isn\'t
so bad. Cleaning up after a place like this. It isn\'t exactly as lively
as my other job\...but\...I kinda like that. No drunken perverts to
throw coins into my jugs\...\' She got a bit lost in her thoughts and
knocked one of her massive breasts into one of the display cases. It
rocked back and forth, and Sakura glanced up in surprise, taking hold to
stabilize it. Before she could, something fell from the top of it and
landed directly into her expanse of cleavage.\
\
"Eep!" After making sure the display was completely stable, she looked
down at her bosom. Lodged inside her two orbs of flesh was an orange
object. It seemed to be made of yarn, but she couldn't see the whole
thing. She reached in and pulled it out, and it was revealed to be a
small doll of some kind, hand woven out of thick, durable yarn. \
\
"Aww, its like Sack Boy!" Sakura giggled at her video game reference and
continued to observe the doll. Its largest feature was its head. Bigger
than its torso, it was a sort of burnt orange color, with two small blue
eyes, two strings of darker colored yarn for eyebrows, as well as a yarn
formed on the bottom of its face in the shape of a smile. Its body was
small and short, and the same color as its head. With two long arms that
reached a little bit past its short torso, it had no hands, but instead,
rounded off nubs at the end of its thin arms. It also had two stubby
little legs. And to top it all off, it wore a small blue and white scarf
around its neck. Sakura finished observing it and smiled.\
\
"Ooh, this is so cute! I gotta show this to Niss after I\'m done\...for
now\..." Sakura opened up the waistband of her dark blue booty shorts
and slid it on the side of her plump booty, snapping the waistband
around its small torso. She resumed her dusting, almost completed, when
she began to feel a strange wiggling emanating from her shorts.\
\
"What the\...?" She took a look down to see the source of the commotion.
Her eyes widened when she saw the doll wriggling free from her shorts
and popping out, floating just nearby her.\
\
"GAHH! I can\'t keep it up in there!" The doll yelped in a tiny,
slightly high-pitched, but still male-sounding voice. Sakura and the
doll just stared at each other for a moment in awkward silence. Sakura
held out her index finger and slowly pushed it forwards, tapping
slightly onto the sack doll\'s small torso. The doll responded, bringing
his nubs to her finger, observing her delicate digits with his small
blue eyes. They both stood there like this, observing each other in
quiet, until Sakura finally reacted.\
\
"OH MY GAWD YOU\'RE SO CUTE!" Sakura yelled, pulling in the floating
anomaly and pressing into her large sweater puppies.\
\
"Hehe\...this is more like it\..." He rubbed his small head into
Sakura\'s soft tit flesh as Sakura pressed him inwards. She eventually
let go, letting him stay there a few moments before floating back up.
"You\'re not surprised by me?" Sakura shrugged.\
\
"I\'ve got a friend who has a bat\...imp\...thing at home, so I\'ve seen
worse." The doll scratched his head, then shrugged. "So what\'s your
name, lil guy?" \
\
"Its Whit." He said with a smile, continuing to float around her. \
\
"Whit huh? How\'d you get that kind of name?" Whit floated up to a shelf
and sat, looking down.\
\
"Well, it had to do with the first thing I saw when I was born. I looked
over at Crimson\'s shelf and looked at her books-"\
\
"Wait\...who is Crimson?" Whit looked at her confused, then smacked his
face softly with one of his nub-hands. \
\
"Whoops, I meant Tiffany. Sorry, I call her that." Sakura nodded.\
\
"So you\'re her\...?"\
\
"I\'m her best friend." Whit smiled at this remark. "Now what\'s your
name, Miss?" Sakura laughed a bit at being called \'Miss\', as no one
really had done that before.\
\
"Its Sakura. Sakura Mizuumi." Whit nodded in confirmation, then floated
back over to her, holding out one of his long arms.\
\
"Well its nice to meet you." Sakura looked at his arm for a moment, then
giggled, taking it by her index finger and thumb, shaking lightly. "Is
it ok if I call you\..." He looked up at her cyan hair and blinked, then
smiled. "\...Blue?" Sakura eyed him curiously, then nodded.\
\
"Sure."\
\
"Yay!" He jumped down into her cleavage and sunk in, letting the walls
of juicy flesh surround his body. Sakura laughed and wiggled around,
Whit\'s body tickling her boobs. After a few moments of this, Sakura
began to hear a tapping noise of some kind. She looked up and saw
Tiffany in the opening of the aisle, a disgruntled look on her face.\
\
"I see you\'ve met Whit\..." \
\
"Uh\..." Whit said nervously, then popped down in between Sakura\'s
breasts all the way. This only further agitated Tiffany, who was now
almost growling in irritation.\
\
"WHIT! Get out here!" Whit raised his head slowly out of Sakura\'s
cleavage, then squirmed out, popping out of the tight space and floating
over to Tiffany, head hung low.\
\
"Aww, go easy on the little guy, Tiff\..." \
\
"He knows better\..." She held an index finger up to his face and
scowled. "Don\'t you?" Whit nodded and sat on Tiffany\'s shoulder. She
let out a sigh at this, patting him softly. He smiled again, as did
she.\
\
"Wow\...that was a quick make-up\..." Sakura muttered.\
\
"Its hard to stay mad at this little guy\..." Sakura was still a bit
confused by the whole thing, but just went with it. "He means a lot to
me after all\..." Sakura noticed some sort of pang of pain hit Tiffany.
She saw it in her eyes. But it passed quickly and she was smiling again.
"Wanna go meet my other employee, Whit?" Whit stood to attention at this
statement.\
\
"You mean she WORKS here?" Tiffany laughed loud at this. \
\
"Yes dear, they\'re here for another 5 or 6 days to work off a debt."
Whit thought about this, his stubby hand up to his mouth, then his limbs
flew up again, his eyes somehow widening.\
\
"And you mean to tell me that there is ANOTHER one working here?!" Whit
said with obvious excitement. \
\
"I\'ll introduce you\...but you behave yourself, alright?" She rubbed
his chin with her forefinger, and he nodded. "I don\'t think we\'ll have
too many issues with Nissa\...Whit\'s more of a boob guy, anyways\..."\
\
"Well, Nissa isn\'t exactly flat chested\..."\
\
"Yes, well, compared to you dear, her and I both look a little less
impressive in that field. Hence this little perverts reaction." She
poked Whit again in the stomach, and he let out a quick giggle like the
Pillsbury dough boy, as a joke. "I do appreciate his limits though. He
can\'t stand being inside pants or panties. So I\'ll never have to worry
about that\...at least he kept that gentlemanly part about himself\..."\
\
"Wait\...what do you mean\...\'kept\'?" Tiffany waved it off as she made
her way over to Nissa.\
\
"Too long of a story, dear. Now then, come with me over to Nissa, you
did just fine. Its break time anyways, lets go tell Niss\..."\
\
\*\*Day 3: Potion Making 101\*\*\
\
Sakura and Nissa stepped inside the shop, their boobs and butts
shrinking just a little as they entered. Nissa smiled.\
\
"Ah\...I can\'t wait until its always like this\..." She rubbed her
booty, still rather massive.\
\
"As soon as we get all this done, we\'re gonna be working out more.
Getting that thing under control."\
\
"I know, I know Kura\...you\'ve told me a million times!" Nissa pouted a
little, and Sakura responded with a slight smirk.\
\
"Most women would kill for a booty like that, dear." They heard a voice
say from the other side of the shop. Both their eyes darted to the other
side of the shop, Tiffany making her entrance from one of the back
rooms. "I don\'t see how its too much of a detriment." Nissa blushed a
bit, bringing her two index fingers together in a nervous fashion.\
\
"W\...well\...its not too bad\...b-but\...I keep knocking it into
things\...and my\...m-m-m\..." Tiffany walked over, leaning over on the
counter, her chest leaning downwards, displaying the plethora of
cleavage she had spilling out of her corset.\
\
"Your what, dear?" She asked, having an idea of what the answer was.\
\
"M-my\..." her voice fell to a faint whisper. "my panties are always so
tight\..." Tiffany brought a hand to her ear and cupped it, leaning in
jokingly.\
\
"What was that about panties?!" Tiffany shouted. Nissa instantly went
red and flustered, shuffling from foot to foot. Tiffany merely laughed.
"Alright dears, time for something a bit different. My potions have been
selling relatively well lately, so I\'ll need you both to come with me."
They both made their way over, Kura leaning to Nissa\'s ear. \
\
"I swear, I haven\'t seen a single customer come in her since we
started\..." \
\
A sudden orange blur appeared and landed right between Sakura\'s boobs.
She let out a soft yelp as the sack doll turned and smiled at her,
waving a bit as he pulled himself out of the walls of cleavage, resting
on the supple mass of breast. Sakura smiled patting him on the head.\
\
"Hello there Whit. Nice to see you again." Whit grinned.\
\
"Hello there Blue. Hello Miss Peach." He waved over at Nissa, who
giggled at her nickname and waved a single finger back at him. \
\
They made their way deeper into the section, the room being dark, lit
only by dim candlelight in the corners, and around the center on the
table that rested there. Tiffany drew the curtains closed behind them as
she prepared.\
\
"I like it dark. Sets the mood." She resumed setting up, pulling out a
black cauldron from under the table, and heading over to the cabinets on
the other side. Nissa and Sakura stood there, a bit cramped, Sakura\'s
boobs rubbing against Nissa\'s arm. Nissa paid no mind to this, though,
as she was pretty much used to it. They stood in silence for a little
bit, Whit floating up and off Sakura\'s boobs (most likely because
Tiffany was in the room), until she had everything she needed.\
\
"Now then\...today the shop will be closed for a bit, in preparation for
the new potions\...and I need your girls\' help. You\'re essentially
going to be learning how to brew potions." Both girls\' eyes went wide
at this. They had never even gotten close to this kind of stuff. They
had seen Mano doing occasional potion work, but she always pushed them
out of her room as soon as she noticed them.\
\
She laid the ingredients on the table. Some sort of root-like object,
some shredded peelings that looked like they were from an odd sort of
fruit; a moldy looking piece of meat, and a vial of clear liquid.\
\
"Well this looks\...appetizing\..." Sakura said with a sarcastic bite.
Whit chuckled a bit at her statement.\
\
"Its not supposed to be healthy dear. These potions are for very special
purposes. The ones I want you to brew are these\..." She handed them a
book with certain highlighted pages, pointing out the ingredients and
instructions. They both nodded as she headed out. Se turned to them
before she had left completely.\
\
"Oh, don\'t worry about getting any on you, dears. These ones are safe
for the skin, I made sure of that. Just don\'t ingest large quantities
of them, ok?" Nissa and Sakura nodded, letting Tiffany exit completely,
leaving them to work. \
\
"Alright\...we need to put this in first\..." Sakura held up the vial
and uncorked it, letting it spill into the cauldron. Nissa nodded,
continuing to read the instructions. \
\
"Which one is\...Sich\...sick\...shick\..." Nissa struggled to read the
ingredient printed in the book. Sakura leaned over to see the word.\
\
"Sichoph\...Jesus, is that even a word\..." Sakura leaned over to read
it a bit more, Whit floating back down to look at the book as well.\
\
"Ah, Sichopheranerian root." They both looked at Whit, who stared at
them with his blank stare smile of innocence. "What? Don\'t think I
would have this down by now?" He chuckled and pointed to the mass of
tangled roots. "That\'s the one. Toss it in. Do be careful when making
this one, it makes weird things happen if not made properly." Nissa
nodded and Sakura took a pinch of the roots and tossed them in. They
kept at it, adding ingredient after ingredient, until it was complete. \
\
"Ooh! Ya did good ladies!" Whit nodded and hovered around the potion.
"Basic moisturizing lotion. Its like lotion for your beautiful boobs!"\
\
"Ah, so she specializes in pharmaceuticals as well?" Sakura asked the
orange sack boy. He shrugged.\
\
"I guess. She does a lot of stuff. She focuses on one thing, and
that\'s\...well, I bet you two can guess." Nissa laughed nervously, then
looked at the potion.\
\
"So its done\...?" She asked, looking back up at Whit.\
\
"Well, in its current state, yes, but\..." He floated over to the
cabinet and pulled out a strange white sphere. "I know something that
can make this super special!" He dropped it in and the brew began to
bubble, letting out pops and spats. It was soon boiling over.\
\
"Uhh\...Whit\...just what did you d-" \
\
SPLAT!\
\
The potion exploded all over the two girls, soaking them from head to
toe. They both let out a shriek as they felt their bodies getting
progressively warmer. \
\
"WHIT! WHAT THE HELL?!" Sakura yelled, grabbing at the mischievous
little poppet. He looked at them with concern and worry.\
\
"Oh goodness! I\'m so sorry! I really mean it, I had no idea it would do
this! Shoot, I must have grabbed the wrong orb\..." He went over to the
book and looked through it.\
\
Meanwhile, Nissa was nudging Sakura with her elbow, trying to grab her
attention. Sakura looked over, still annoyed from Whit\'s foolish
actions.\
\
"What\'s up Niss?" She glanced over at her, seeing her shake and
tremble, her booty beginning to rock back and forth, her boobs jiggling
in her shirt.\
\
"UHH\...I\'m not doing any of that Kura\..." Sakura\'s eyes widened as
she looked at herself, seeing similar effects hit her own self. Her
boobs seemed to wobble and jiggle back and forth on their own, as if
possessed by their own mini-earthquake.\
\
"WHIIIIIIT!!" Sakura tried to step over, but noticed her ass was swaying
left and right. She couldn\'t control herself. Her body was hot and
bothered, and needed to move at all costs. She shook it left and right,
her hips swaying to an unheard rhythm.\
\
Nissa joined right in, her movements becoming more and more provocative
by the moment. She was blushing hard, a look of complete horror spread
across her face.\
\
"KURA! Why\...why am I doing thiiiiiis?" She whined as she popped her
hips back and forth, her tremendous shelf of a booty jiggling this way
and that.\
\
"CUZ WHIT IS A CARELESS MORON, THAT\'S WHY!" Whit turned to face Sakura,
a look of genuine self-disappointment in his small blue eyes. Sakura
looked back, now feeling a bit guilty at her outburst. She continued to
shake left and right, her boobs now straining her tight tank top with
their constant movement.\
\
"Oooohhh\...I\'m sorry Whit\...I didn\'t mean it\..." Whit shook his
head and went over to them.\
\
"Well, you are kind of right, Blue. I really am sorry\..." Sakura waved
him over the best she could, her dancing now completely unhinged.\
\
"Its alright Whit\...really, I\'m not hurt or anything\...it could\'ve
been worse\...I could have\...I dunno, turned to stone or something?"
Nissa bumped her wide load into Sakura\'s own posterior and they
rebounded a bit, catching their balance and continuing their endless
dancing. "Damn! I only dance like this when I\'m at the club\..."\
\
With that, Tiffany came barging through the curtain, glancing at the
girls\' predicament. They stood there for a moment, Tiffany eying as
they shook around, bobbing this way and that to no music. Tiffany looked
at Nissa, then at Sakura, then at Whit, then closed her eyes. After a
moment of more silence, Tiffany broke it.\
\
"BAHAHAHAAAA!" Tiffany began to laugh hard and loud, buckling over from
her screams of jovial expression. "YOU TWO LOOK SO SILLY RIGHT NOW!" She
resumed her her relentless cackle as Sakura and Nissa watched helplessly
in their hyper-active states.\
\
"Yeah\...we know Tiff\...can you, ya know, MAKE US NORMAL?" Sakura
yelled at her, Nissa, still red as a tomato, her eyes closed shut,
keeping her hands closed in delicate fists.\
\
"Aww, and ruin the fun so soon?" She winked. Sakura merely shot her a
harsh glare, her breasts bouncing up and down, hitting her chin over and
over. Tiffany sighed and snapped her fingers. "Fine, fine\..." And with
that, they stopped immediately, letting out pants of exhaustion, leaning
over, resting their hands on their thighs. "You two are in for a fun
time if you keep messing about like this."\
\
"We weren\'t\...the ones\...who did it\..." Sakura said in between
breaths. Tiffany looked up at Whit and scowled, but winked soon after,
waving him over. He complied, floating over and resting on her
shoulder.\
\
"Well then, let\'s hope this luck keeps up then. I\'ll keep him out so
you two can finish your work correctly. Try not to cause any trouble
that this little guy hasn\'t already wrought, ok?" She stepped out,
leaving Nissa and Sakura to their mission.\
\
"Yeah\...let\'s just\...be careful\...from now on, what do you
say\...Niss?" Sakura asked, gradually getting her breath back. Nissa
nodded, smiling at her friend as she stood back up, ready to finish
their work.\
\
\*\*Day 4: Curiosity\'s Consequences\*\*\
\
"This way ladies, there\'s something new I would like to show you."
Nissa and Sakura followed Tiffany towards the bookshelf section of the
store. Seven different rows of bookshelves stretched down to the other
side of the store. In the center, between shelves 3 and 4 was a large
space, with a round table and a few chairs. On the table were a few
stacks of varying books, some large and thick, some smaller and thinner,
like a pocket book. "Today, dears\...you will be learning magic." Nissa
and Kura both turned to Tiff with varied expressions of confusion.\
\
"Umm\...how, exactly, when we aren\'t\...witches
or\...spellcasters\...?" Sakura asked hesitantly. Tiffany looked at her
and giggled lightly, but in and understanding way.\
\
"Spells can be used by any kind of person, any mortal. It is the magic
within the spell that matters, and that is created by spellcrafters,
such as myself\..." She gestured to the books on the table. "I picked
these out myself. They contain spells of various types. You are free to
choose whatever spells you like from them and attempt to learn them.
They are beginners\' books, so they shouldn\'t be all that hard to
figure out." She stepped away from them, heading back to the front
counter. "I have business to attend to. You ladies go on and have fun. I
want you to be able to defend yourself against that Mano friend of
yours, so this will be handy when you\'re no longer under my
surveillance. Have fun! And don\'t touch any of the other books, ok
dears?" \
\
"Got it Tiff!" Sakura called out to the now non-present Tiffany and went
over to the various leather-bound novels. "I\'ve always wanted to learn
this sort of stuff\...Mano never let me near any of her things\...well,
at least while she was around." She opened one and began flipping
through its pages. Nissa joined her, and started to look through one of
her own.\
\
"Magic always sorta\...freaked me out a little\..." Nissa said with
apprehension. Sakura nodded.\
\
"Well, I don\'t blame you. The most you\'ve been exposed to is the stuff
that messes with your body\..." Sakura snickered and pointed an index
finger around Nissa. "Especially the junk you keep in your trunk." Nissa
blushed at this statement, and subconsciously rubbed her large posterior
with her hand.\
\
"I\...can\'t help that I have a large bum, Sakura\..." She looked a bit
down with this remark, and Sakura noticed, setting the book and looking
over at her friend.\
\
"Hey\...don\'t worry about it, alright. Tiffany\'s making sure that we
never have to worry about this sort of stuff ever again. I know
you\'re\...not comfortable with that caboose of yours. I don\'t blame
you, I\'m carrying a lot more up top myself, Niss\..." Sakura wobbled
her boobs in her T-shirt, causing it to groan in its semi-tightness.
"\...but we\'ll work something out, alright? We\'re gonna get it under
control so you never have to worry about it\...bumping into guys or
knocking over things ever again, alright?" She let out a final kind
smile. Nissa sighed in relief and nodded, beginning to leaf through the
books. \
\
They looked through various pages and books, looking for things that
piqued their interest.\
\
"Ah! Here\'s a neat one!" Sakura pointed out a spell in a rather small
brown leather book. "Telekinesis. You know, like psychic powers?
Alakazam style?" Nissa giggled and nodded looking over at the book. \
\
"It looks\...simple\..." \
\
"Well, I think its supposed to be. Tiff picked these out for a
reason\...I think they\'re beginner books\...let\'s try this out\..."
Sakura noticed that a cup of tea was resting on the table the whole
time, a spoon still in it. She looked over at it and tried rotating her
finger concentrating hard. She looked back at the book and read the
instructions. "Says here it just takes focus\...willpower\...and
practice\...there are some initiating words of some kind to bring the
abilities out in a person\...we also need\...the conscious thought and
belief that something like it can exist\..."\
\
"So\...we can\'t doubt that we can do it?" Nissa asked, still staring
over at the mug.\
\
"I think so\...and if I have seen anything\...I know for a fact that
magic exists\...so psychic powers might as well be real too\..." Sakura
said casually as she stared at the mug. A few minutes passed as she
stared at the mug, swirling her finger, waiting for something to happen.
Just as she was about to take a break and come back to it, the spoon
nudged to the side. Sakura perked up at this, her bored eyes suddenly
full of interest. She continued her efforts, staring more and more
intensely on the spoon inside the mug. After a few more minutes, the
spoon was moving, very very slowly around the mug. It took a whole five
minutes for the spoon to make one lap. Nissa merely watched, awestruck
by this.\
\
"C-can I try\...?" Sakura nodded, pointing out the spell to her. Nissa
read it, then  looked over at the mug. She tried the same thing,
twirling her finger. The spoon suddenly shot out of the mug and into the
air, nearly hitting the ceiling. Nissa yelped, watching it come crashing
back down to the floor. Sakura looked at her with sheer shock on her
face.\
\
"Wow\...damn, Niss, how\'d you do that?" Nissa looked back, the look of
shock mirrored on her face. \
\
"I\...I don\'t know\..." Sakura pulled the mug closer to her and
observed it. It was still full to the brim with tea.\
\
\'I wonder if this is still ok to drink\...\' Sakura thought to herself.
She shook her head, not wanting to chance it. She set the mug back down,
resuming her search.\
\
They looked into telekinesis, its powers seeming limitless and the most
interesting. Nissa sort of shrugged off the shock of her ability and
resumed her search. The one that stood out the most to her was animal
communication. Sakura observed a few more, water and electrical
manipulation being of most interest to her. She read a particularity
fascinating spell, and tried it out, snapping her fingers. To her
surprise, a small spark of electricity came out of it, but it made
almost no sound. Nissa didn\'t even notice, she was too engrossed in her
reading. Sakura kept this discovery to herself and resumed reading.\
\
After an hour or two of reading and studying, Sakura heard a faint
rustling from nearby.\
\
"Hear that?" Sakura asked Nissa. Nissa looked up, now paying attention
to the sounds around her. After a few moments, just as they were about
to resume their readings, Sakura noticed a familiar figure hovering
above the bookcases.\
\
"Whit! What are you doing over there?" Sakura called out. Whit whipped
around, surprised to hear Kura\'s voice. He then smiled and calmed,
hovering over to them, book in hand, struggling to float with the
weighty novel in his nubby mitts. \
\
"Ah, hello Blue, Miss Peach." Nissa smiled and waved back with her
finger, as she usually did. "I was merely getting a few books for
Crimson. Not sure if its this one, or\..." He left the book on the table
and floated back over to the shelf, resuming his search. Nissa brought
her eyes to the new addition to the table and lifted it, bringing it
over to her. Sakura kept looking over at Whit, finding him adorable as
he struggled to pull out one of the weightier publications.\
\
Nissa opened the novel, curious to see some of the spells that it
contained. It seemed a lot stranger than the ones they had on their
table. A lot of various languages she couldn\'t read or understand, but
most of it was in English. Sakura finally turned back to Nissa, Whit
floating away with the book he thought was right, and noticed Nissa
flipping through the pages of the alien book.\
\
"Niss!" Sakura shouted, slamming the spellbook shut in her friend\'s
hands. Nissa jumped, then looked up at her friend, her guilty-puppy dog
emerald eyes shining up at Kura. Sakura sighed, then shook her head.\
\
"God, you don\'t even know what this has in it! We are ONLY supposed to
use the ones that Tiffany wanted us to, nothing more\..." She stood, and
began to take it over to the shelf. As she made it halfway over, she
couldn\'t help but let her curiosity begin to poke at her mind. She
stopped, opening up the novel to the middle. "Then again\...I wonder
what this one even has in terms of spells\..." She looked at the strange
spells, reading one randomly from the page, description and all.\
\
"\'Magic Experiment by Tiffany: Stacked High and Low. High for the
reader, low for the friend. Minor. All that needs to be done is to read
the name of the spell and it-\'" Sakura\'s eyes widened as she felt
herself go hot. She slammed the book shut, rushing over to the bookshelf
and shoving it into place. She stepped back over to the table quickly
and  rested her hands on the back of the chair, trying to act calm, but
feeling a tingling starting to take hold of her bosom.\
\
"Uhh\...Kura\...is everything alright\...?" Sakura nodded, forcing a
smile on her face, but a bead of sweat rolled from her temple down the
side of her face.\
\
"I uh\...might have\...made a mistake\..." She tried to say it in as
much of a composed manner as she could.\
\
"What kind of mistake Kura\...oop!" Nissa\'s head whipped to her behind
as she felt it begin to pulse a bit with warmth. "Uhhhm\...Sakura\...my
bum feels really\...weird\..."\
\
"Yeahhhh\...about that\...I may have kinda\...sorta\...read off a spell
that\...does\...stuuuuuf\..." Nissa eyed her friend curiously.\
\
"What kind of stUU-" She felt the chair groan as her booty puffed out a
millimeter on both sides. She instantly turned three shades of pink,
each one darker than the next. "KURAAAA!" Sakura stared down at her
colossal bust as it stretched forward. Ever so slowly, her breasts
pushed outwards into her already skin tight T-shirt. Her breathing
became labored as heat shot through her whole body. She wasn\'t growing
that big or that fast, but it felt like nothing she had ever felt
before. \
\
She collapsed onto the chair, unable to bear her own weight with her
weak, wobbling knees. Nissa clenched her fingers into her hips as they
flared out, millimeter after millimeter, becoming rounder and more
pronounced by the moment. "UNNH! This is the opposite of what you
promised Kura\..." Sakura looked up from her puffy breasts, now
beginning to strain the buttons of her blouse, and at her friend, whose
bottom was noticeably larger, but not by much.\
\
Nissa\'s skirt began to tighten around her thick thighs and plump
bottom, her cheeks getting thicker and juicier by the moment. Sakura
suffered the same fate in her bosom, her shirt beginning to stretch
upwards, revealing her tight belly. \
\
As soon as the growth arrived, it had ended. Both girls had packed on a
good inch onto either side of them. Nissa\'s rump had gone from
cantaloupes to basketballs, with Kura hitting an I cup, as big as she
was when she was outside the store. She shook her head in horror. \
\
"TIFFANY!" Sakura called out into the store. Instantly, their boss
appeared, pushing up her glasses and looking the girls over. She sighed
and laughed softly.\
\
"I told you not to touch other books, dears. Goodness, I didn\'t want to
have to save you again. Too much excitement from either of you."\
\
"Can you get us back to our old size?" Nissa asked , her cheeks spilling
over the sides of the chair. \
\
"Of course dears, it shouldn\'t be an issue. Which book did you read the
spell from, hm?" Sakura began walking over, taking out the green book
and handing it over to Tiffany. The instant it landed in Tiffany\'s
eyes, they went wide in fear. "Oh\...goodness\...dear\...it h-had to be
this one\...didn\'t it\..."\
\
"What do you mean?" Nissa asked, trying to stand, still adjusting to the
added weight in her butt.\
\
"This\...is one of my earliest spell books that I ever
wrote\...and\...well, to put things simply, I\...can\'t get you back to
normal." Both Nissa and Sakura\'s hearts dropped at this news.\
\
"B-but\...why\...why not?" Sakura asked, flabbergasted.\
\
"Well\...you see\...back when I first started out I\...was never really
good at reversals or\...reduction spells. Reduction spells are
impossible to use on my permanency spells. They only make things
worse\...oh dear, this is bad\...my early spells wrought all sorts of
havoc\...for all I know, those things are ticking time bombs\...and
there\'s nothing I can do to stop them\..." Sakura and Nissa looked at
themselves. Sakura felt horrible, the guilt sweeping across her in
waves.\
\
"Is there anything you can do\...?" Tiffany stood there in silence for a
bit, then shook her head, resting her hand on Sakura\'s shoulder
comfortingly. \
\
"I can look into this one and make sure nothing worse can come of it.
That\'s all I can really do. Maybe make a sealing hex to keep any
adverse effects from happening. But as far as size\...they\'re\...stuck
like this\...I\'m so sorry dears\..." Sakura flopped down on the chair,
her I cup boobs wobbling about, causing her shirt to strain a bit.  \
\
"Its\...its my fault anyways\...I shouldn\'t have read it in the first
place\..."\
\
"I shouldn\'t have even opened it Kura\...I\'m sure I didn\'t help
either\...I was reading it some too\...I just got lucky that nothing
happened\..." Sakura sighed, her palms on her forehead.\
\
"I didn\'t want us to get any bigger\...we were big enough already\..."
Tiffany scoffed a bit.\
\
"Ladies, the size you are at is noting to mope about." They both looked
up at Tiff, who had a defiant look in her eyes. "You hardly grew at all,
for goodness sakes! It could have been MUCH worse than this, remember
that! An extra inch hasn\'t killed anyone. You can still walk around
just fine, now can\'t you?" Nissa stood and tried walking. More flesh
wiggled in her skirt than she was used to, but other than that, she was
fine. She nodded and smiled a bit.\
\
"Yeah\...you\'re right\...I guess we did get off sorta lucky."\
\
"This book contains spells that make you grow bigger than houses. Even
bigger than that! So count yourselves lucky that this is as big as you
got." Tiffany winked, returning the book to the shelf. Just as she did,
the orange sack doll came rounding around the corner, flying directly
into Tiffany\'s exposed cleavage.\
\
\'MRRF!" He shouted into her tit flesh. Tiffany laughed, pulling him
out.\
\
"I bet you had something to do with this, didn\'t you?" Whit looked
over, noticing the flesh spilling out of Sakura\'s collar, and Nissa,
who, in his eyes, still looked relatively normal. He looked back over at
Tiffany and raised one of his woven eyebrows.\
\
"You can\'t prove NUTHIN!" He shouted. Tiffany scowled at him, shoving
his head down her chest and squeezing her boobs together. He wriggled in
half-protest as Tiffany walked away, waving over at Nissa and Sakura.\
\
"Feel free to stay the night ladies while we get things sorted on your
bodies. I don\'t want you leaving this magic force field until we know
what\'s going on with you, alright?"\
\
Nissa and Sakura stayed the night in one of the many back rooms, which
contained bunk beds. Nissa took bottom while Sakura took the top bunk.
Nissa looked up above her, hearing the springboard slightly creak under
the weight.\
\
"Sakura\...?" She asked softly.\
\
"Hmm?" Sakura responded sleepily.\
\
"Do you think\...we\'ll be ok\...?"\
\
"We only have to work here 3 more days, Niss. What\'s the worst that
could happen, alright?" Nissa drew the sheets up over her breasts and
sighed, shifting on her large, round rump.\
\
\'This feels exactly how it does whenever I leave\...just as big\...but
when we leave\...its gonna get even bigger\...at least until we\'re done
here\...\' Nissa turned to her side, feeling her booty jiggle softly as
she planted herself firmly on the mattress. \'Even then\...I really hope
that I don\'t get any bigger\...ever again\...\' She kept this thought
in mind as she drifted to sleep.

\*\*Day 5: Wardrobe Malfunction\*\*\
\
"From what I can tell, there aren\'t any residuals left inside you right
now\..." Tiffany noted as she finished waving a glowing hand over both
Nissa and Sakura. "At least, none that can be identified easily\..."
Sakura stared down, her cleavage going on for longer than she preferred.
She could only imagine what would happen when they exited. The thought
made her shudder, which in turn made her breasts bobble about in her
tight blouse.\
\
"So\...how exactly did you get us back to normal before if you can\'t do
reversals?" Sakura asked out of curiosity as Nissa sat back down, her
butt having a full scan from Tiffany\'s magic hands. She seemed to have
a look of embarrassed discomfort as it happened.\
\
"Well\...alright, I should probably get a bit more technical. The way I
craft my spells now, they have some very important guidelines:
causation, effects, and reversals. Back when I was first starting out, I
was obsessed with growth and was never really concerned with reversals.
So, the very first\...100 or so books I made had spells crafted with
only causation and effects in mind. Think of it like this dears: Each
spell has its very own reversal attached to it. Some I can do with the
wave of my hand, some are a bit more complicated and require a bit of
figuring out. Those were in my middle years of creating spells. I
wasn\'t completely good with reversals, as I am now." She went over to
the computer on her register and prepared to open the store.\
\
"So\...you can\'t get rid of any of this? What if we had a reduction or
something?" Tiffany looked over and raised an eyebrow to this.\
\
"If big breasts were such an issue, why hadn\'t you gotten them reduced
in the first place, dear?" Sakura raised a finger and began to speak,
but stopped mid-thought.\
\
"Well\...um\...they never bothered me all THAT much\..." Tiffany
smirked.\
\
\"Face it dear. You LOVE the attention you can get from those." Sakura
blushed, but crossed her arms under her shelf of a bosom.\
\
"Hmph. As if getting ogled by guys on a daily basis is fun. Getting
dollar bills and coins thrown down my cleavage\...guys drooling all over
me\...no thanks. But\..." She looked back down at them, a look of worry
on her face. "\...I never HATED my body. I\'m not gonna lie, I do like
these things\...because they\'re mine, y\'know? Most of them
anyways\..." Tiffany smiled genuinely and nodded.\
\
"I wish I could say the same dear. It is something special when you can
grow them naturally as big as you were when I found you. I was surprised
that the reversal I used back in your home left you THAT large." She
looked over at Nissa, who was subconsciously rubbing her bottom. "I
sense some apprehension from you dear. Are you not a fan of such a
prodigious posterior?" Nissa shook her head a bit.\
\
"I\'ve\...never liked my butt, Tiffany. It always gets in the way\...and
its hard to buy pants and stuff that fit\...and I feel like\...like\..."
Nissa trailed off, not wanting to say. \
\
"Like\...?" Tiffany asked, motioning her hand in a circular motion,
egging Nissa to finish her thought.\
\
"Like\...guys just see me as a walking bottom rather than a..well\..."\
\
"A whole person?" Tiffany finished for her. Nissa nodded. With a wave of
her hand, Tiffany scoffed and gave Nissa a comforting gaze. "Dear, those
are the men you have to avoid, anyways. Not all of them are like that,
trust me." She glanced at the computer again and sighed. "Oi, I love
having heart to heart talks, girls, but we need to open up. We\'ve had
this conversation already, kind of. Do your best today, alright? Clean
up the back a little bit, we\'ll take a break from magic for the time
being." The girls nodded and went to complete their assigned duties.\
\
The day went by, nothing too out of the ordinary occurring. At one
point, Sakura went over to check up on Niss, who was reaching up to put
something on a high shelf. Her tight skirt raised just enough so a tiny
portion of her panties, as well as the bottom bit of her booty, stuck
out just a little. \
\
"Oi, Niss! Pull your skirt down some, we don\'t need any werewolves
coming out in the store. Its weird enough here as it is." She stuck out
her tongue and winked, and Niss looked down at herself, surprised. She
dropped the book she was putting up, letting it slam against the ground
as she quickly pulled down her tight skirt as much as she could.\
\
"Th-thanks Kura\..." Nissa said, her face hot with embarrassment. Sakura
laughed a bit, trying to lighten her mood. \
\
"Its no problem Niss\...let\'s just get through the rest of this week,
alright? Then we can go back to\...semi-normal, I guess\..." She looked
down at her white button-up blouse, the buttons straining to stay
together, small thin diamond-shaped holes forming in the upper and mid
portions of it. She sighed, then resumed her careful cleaning of the
various knick-knacks.\
\
Finally, the day came to an end, it seeming to go rather slow for the
girls, compared to all the insanity occurring for them in the past week.
They said their good-byes to Tiffany and walked out the door. As soon as
their feet hit the outside pavement, they began to feel warm, and it
wasn\'t from the sun.\
\
"Brace yourself Niss\..." Sakura whispered to her friend. They had
experienced this sensation 3 times prior to this, since they never left
the premises yesterday, but every time it felt almost different. This
time they had much more flesh to be built upon. Sakura\'s breasts
wobbled and bubbled before letting out a soft groan, her boobs pushing
out of her t-shirt like they were being pumped with air. Three of her
top buttons popped off immediately as they reached J cup in size, the
size of bowling balls. "Shit\...ugh\..." Sakura moaned in protest as the
top of her nipples puffed out of the top of her bra, able to be seen
easily. "Well\...that\'s just\...fantastic\..." Sakura said with a
bitter sarcasm. She also felt her pants get tighter, but since she had
no other growth down there that was out of the ordinary, her pants held
up just fine.\
\
Nissa began wiggling her butt in protest as her skirt rode up even
higher, a good inch of cheek now on full display. \
\
"Eep!" She yelped in protest, tugging on her skirt as she tried to hide
her massive badonk, which was as big as two medicine balls getting
hugged tightly together. Sakura gawked in surprise at Nissa\'s now
indecent exposure.\
\
"Jeez, Niss, why were you wearing that thing in the first place? You
have plenty of pants to wear!" Nissa shook her head, her eyes opening
from their harsh squint, the growth subsiding. Her chest had also pumped
up an inch, but as with Sakura and her butt, because there had been no
additional growth in that department, there was no such struggle. This
didn\'t excuse the tremendous booty that Nissa was now packing, her
wardrobe gone from mildly suggestive to scantily clad.\
\
"I couldn\'t find any! I dunno why but all I had in my closet were
skirts. I thought you were doing laundry today or something\..."\
\
"Mano\..." Sakura muttered her name as if it was a curse word. She
tapped her foot on the ground in frustration.\
\
"Wh\...what do we do now?" Nissa asked, not daring to move from the
spot, keeping her bottom facing away from the street.\
\
"Well\...go home I suppose\..." Sakura said, still aggravated about the
situation they were put in.\
\
"B-b-but\...oh, I know we were close by, but still\...why did we have to
walk\...?" Nissa asked, still keeping her hands tight on her skirt,
trying to cover as much as she could with what little clothing she had.\
\
"Ugh, screw this\..." Sakura went over to the shop doors and rapped on
the door. "TIFFANY!" The door immediately flung open, Tiffany\'s head
poking out from the opening.\
\
"Yeeeess-oh\...oh my\..."\
\
"Yeah\...we\'re gonna need some new clothes\..."\
\
"Well\...erm\...I don\'t know if-"\
\
"PLEEEEEEEEASE TIFF! Everyone can see my undiiiiies\..." Nissa whined,
hopping from one foot to the next, her booty undulating to and fro to
the rhythm. Tiffany scratched her head in thought then waved them in.\
\
"Alright, alright, come back in, let me look to see if I have
anything\..." Nissa and Sakura stepped back inside, their bodies
shrinking back down an inch, much to their relief. Tiffany bumbled
around a bit in her backroom, and after a little bit of time, walked
back out with two articles of clothing.\
\
\'For you, dear\..." She handed Sakura a dark blue corset. Sakura looked
back at her, raising an eyebrow. "Look, this is on short notice, so take
it or leave it." Tiffany rebuked her with a huff. Sakura sighed and
nodded, taking it in hand. She stepped over to Nissa and handed her a
pair of white yoga pants. \
\
\'Yaaaay!" Nissa cheered in glee, snatching them from Tiffany\'s hands.
Sakura looked over at Tiffany again with her eyebrow arched.\
\
\"Couldn\'t have found a more\...flattering color?"\
\
"What did I JUST say about short notice?" Tiffany said, a hint of
annoyance in her voice. The girls shrugged off their insecurities and
went to the back room to don their outfits. Nissa assisted Sakura with
the corset getting all the ties in place. Despite it being a purposely
tight piece of clothing, it fit like a glove. Nissa gladly disrobed her
skin tight, super short skirt in favor of\...skin tight yoga pants. They
clung tight to her hips, leaving nothing about her booty to the
imagination. \
\
"How does it look Kura?" Niss asked, posing innocently. Sakura smirked a
bit and nodded.\
\
"Well, if anyone can pull off white yoga pants, its definitely you
Niss." Nissa smiled at her friend\'s compliment and picked up her skirt,
ready to leave.\
\
"Now then, before you leave ladies, let me do a bit of something\..."
Tiffany said, waving her hand over the girls. "There. Now when you walk
out and grow again, the clothes should grow along with you." 

\
Sakura and Nissa both thanked Tiffany. Tiffany reminded them that she
needed those clothes back eventually, and with that, they left. Once
again, as they stepped out, their clothes tightened against the amassing
flesh, Sakura\'s breasts getting pushed up and outwards with her corset.
After a few moments, however, the clothes stretched back out and over
their bodies, covering everything comfortably again.\
\
"Whew\...let\'s go home\..." Sakura said as she began to walk down the
street, with Nissa right next to her. "I\'m kind of glad Mano went out
for the night to see a friend of hers\...it\'ll give us a bit of a
break."\
\
\"She hasn\'t been too bad lately, Kura\..." Nissa pointed out.\
\
"Ha, yeah, its cuz she knows she has a loaded magic gun pointed at her
boobs if she tries anything. That\'s the only reason she\'s been nice to
us lately." They continued their walk to their home, it only taking
around 10 minutes. They began their ascent up the stairs when Sakura
began to look down at herself.\
\
"Hey Niss\...you feeling\...funny at all\...?" Sakura asked, a hint of
worry in her voice. Nissa looked down and rubbed her engorged booty a
bit.\
\
"Well\...now that you mention it\...my bottom is kind
of\...tingling\..." \
\
"Crap\...that isn\'t a good sign\..." Sakura worried that it may be
those "residuals" Tiffany mentioned starting to stir up inside their
bodies. "Get inside, we\'ll see what\'s going on then\..." The jiggled
their way upstairs and closed themselves in. As soon as the door had
shut, Sakura felt an explosion of euphoria hit her, her boobs shooting
forward at least three inches.\
\
"HOLY SHIIIIIT!!" Sakura fell to her knees, gripping onto her boobs as
they lurched forward more.\
\
"AHHHHHH!" Nissa screamed as her butt suddenly shot out as well, her
yoga pants making creaks of protest trying to cover all the amassing
flesh. "K\...kura\...what is happening to ussss\...?" More and more tit
flesh poured out of Sakura\'s corset, her boobs now impossibly huge,
getting to the size of watermelons-the kind you would find at county
fairs.\
\
"Ohhhhhh\...maybe Tiffany\...OH\...maybe she missed something\...?" She
felt more and more pleasure stir up inside of her as her breasts
continued to push out and around, becoming more and more bulbous every
passing second.\
\
"Ohhh\...I can feel my panties teaaaaaring Kura\..." Just as she said
it, her bottom ballooned another four or five inches, causing a distinct
"snap!" to be heard as Nissa went a deep shade of scarlet. "MAKE IT STOP
SAKURA!" Nissa pleaded as her booty went on a relentless surge
outwards. \
\
Sakura was suffering under the same fate, her corset beginning to
strain, then readjusting to the huge size, then straining, then
readjusting, over and over until her breasts were as big as beanbag
chairs.\
\
"TIFFANYYYY!" Just as Sakura shouted it, Tiffany appeared in a puff of
smoke nearby.\
\
"You rang, de-HOLY MOTHER OF-" Tiffany responded, trying to be clever
but caught completely off guard by Sakura and Nissa\'s gargantuan sizes.
"Did\...did that roommate of yours\..." They both shook their heads.\
\
"N-no\...at least, we don\'t think so\...she\'s been gone all day\..."
Tiffany walked up to them both, observing them with her magic hands.
After a few moments, she slapped her forehead with the palm of her
hand.\
\
"Well\...that was a stupid mistake on my part\..." Sakura looked at
Tiffany just as her boobs began to reach past her knees.\
\
"Wh-what do you\...?"\
\
"Its the clothes. I gave you enhancement clothes on accident, in my rush
to cover you up. It was in the back\...I thought I kept them back there
because they were, you know, NORMAL clothes in case of
emergencies\...sheesh, I haven\'t messed up this bad in a while\..."\
\
"So\...you can change us back then\...? This isn\'t because of the curse
we already had\...?" Nissa asked as her booty spread out across the
floor, no longer able to stand because of its massive girth, reaching
the size of two beach balls.\
\
"Well\...kind of\...here was the big mistake on my part: they were
already enchanted to make you grow, and they only stop and go back to
normal when they rip off\...but\..."\
\
"You enchanted them so that they stretch over us!" Sakura shouted in
realization, her now yoga ball sized breasts beginning to lift her off
the ground, her corset still somehow managing to stay on her body.
Tiffany waved at them both, a strange aura surrounding them for a brief
moment.\
\
"That should do-" She was drowned out by some incredibly loud ripping,
Nissa\'s pants shredding in and instant. She felt threads rubbing across
her bare bum as one after the other struggled and snapped, more and more
holes appearing across her booty every second, until finally, it was
nothing more than shreds on the floor.\
\
Sakura\'s corset followed suit, the ties on the back giving out from top
to bottom, one by one, not untying, but completely ripping out of the
holes that they looped into. But her breasts still gave one final push
outwards, Sakura moaning loudly in pleasure as it finally completely
came apart, her breasts as wide across as a common sofa.\
\
"My goodness\...well\...that should do it\..." Nissa and Sakura sat
there panting as their bodies gradually shrank back to their previous
sizes. "It seems stacking one spell on another enhanced their magical
capabilities. The more magic I used on the clothes, reversal or
otherwise, tended to fuel the growth. Verrrry interesting\..." Tiffany
took out a notebook from her cleavage and began writing her observations
down. "I\'ll keep that in mind when creating more of those kinds of
clothes.\
\
"Wait\...was that really an accident\...or\...?" Sakura asked
breathlessly, staring up at Tiffany with tired eyes. Tiffany looked back
with a wink.\
\
"Maybe. Maybe not. Who knows? I know I never do!" She stuck out her
tongue, and with that, she snapped her fingers and vanished with a puff
of smoke. \
\
"I\...really can\'t wait until this is over\..." Sakura muttered. "How
about you Niss? How you holding up?" Sakura looked over to see Nissa
passed out, her butt still shrinking down to its old size. She leaned
back peacefully on it as it deflated. Sakura chuckled.\
\
"I guess it has been a tiring week\..." Sakura leaned forward on her
boobs and yawned. They were still pretty massive and were deflating
rather slowly. "Guess I\'ll have these for a while anyways\...they\'re
nice and warm\...mmm\..." \
\
She drifted to sleep alongside Nissa, as the final days of Oddity Shop
work were now within reach.\
\
\*\*Day 6: Cashiering & Betting\*\*\
\
"I\'m just glad I could find some pants to wear today\..." Nissa told
Sakura as they walked into Tiffany\'s shop once again, their curves
reducing by just a little as they stepped in. Sakura was outfitted in a
dark blue T-shirt, straining to hold together, as well as a pair of
faded blue jeans, a rip in one of the knees. Nissa, on the other hand,
was adorned in a tight pink sweater and dark purple yoga pants, trying
her best to hide her curves, something she hadn\'t been able to do for
the past few days.\
\
"I had a feeling Mano was pulling some kind of prank on you\...hiding
all your clothes in her closet\...God, she is so immature
sometimes\..."\
\
"That friend of yours again?" Sakura and Nissa both looked over at
Tiffany, who was still setting up the shop, turning on the registers and
getting them ready. \
\
"Yeah, she\'s kind of stooping a bit low these days\...hiding our
clothes and stuff\..." Tiffany laughed at this.\
\
"Goodness, I can\'t believe she\'s the same age as you ladies\...she
acts like a juvenile. But as long as she\'s not using my magic, I have
no right to intervene, really." Nissa went over to a wooden chair and
sat, causing it to creak under her massive tush, the edges of her cheeks
spilling out over the tiny frame of the chair. Sakura leaned on the
counter, and looked over at Tiffany as she hurried to set up the
registers.\
\
"Hey Tiff\..." Sakura tried to get her manager\'s attention as she
flipped back and forth to various screens.\
\
"Hmm?" Was Tiffany\'s response.\
\
"How come you\'ve never made us cashiers within the time we\'ve been
here?" Tiffany\'s eyes raised up to meet Sakura\'s at this statement.\
\
"Well\...I\'ve always been able to hold down this part pretty well. We
have been getting a lot more customers lately, even if you haven\'t seen
them yourselves, dear\..."\
\
"I\'d love to try selling some of the stuff, rather than just cleaning
and sorting it!" Nissa spoke up from her chair with a smile. Tiffany
smirked a bit, still tapping away on her keyboard.\
\
"Yes\...well\...its easier said than done, dear. Running a shop like
this isn\'t a walk in the park-"\
\
"What, are you saying we\'re not up for the challenge?" Sakura said,
flipping her body so that it faced the counter, a harsh look on her
face.\
\
"I was never challenging you in the first place dears! I\'m just\...much
more experienced than you two\..."\
\
"Hey, I work at a place that requires constant attention and
multitasking to get anything done-"\
\
"You mean that tit bar up North? \'Timothy Two Tits\' or whatever?"
Sakura laughed at this, then shook her head.\
\
"Danny Dees, Tiff\...and yeah, I\'ve worked there a year\..."\
\
"Well, you\'re welcome for the leave time dear. It seems like such a
great place to work" Tiffany said with obvious sarcasm. Sakura
shrugged.\
\
"Its what I could get at the time. They worked with my hours and I
got\...decent pay\..." Sakura lost eye contact with that remark. Tiffany
noticed this and grinned.\
\
"A tittie bar and a shop like mine are two different universes, dear.
You wouldn\'t stand a chance, even with all that\...erm\...\'training\'
of yours\..." Sakura\'s glare returned as she took this as a mild
insult.\
\
"Oh yeah? I bet Niss and I can raise the same amount of cash that you
make on an average day! Easily!" Tiffany\'s eyebrow arched and her grin
became wider.\
\
"Ohh? A bet, eh? How about we make it\...interesting, shall we\...?"
Sakura wavered a bit at Tiffany\'s sauciness, but tried her best to keep
her resolve.\
\
"How so\...?" Nissa stood and went over to her friend.\
\
"Kura\...careful\..." she whispered in her friend\'s ear, knowing full
well Sakura shouldn\'t lose her temper around an powerful magical
being\...cuz that\'s just common sense, after all.\
\
"Alright, let\'s place some stakes\..." Tiffany thought for a moment,
then pulled out her small notebook from her cleavage and opened it,
pulling out a pen from the spiral three ring binding. "How about\...for
every customer you fail to sell to\...that is, walks in and out without
buying a single item\...you grow\...let\'s say, half an inch to your
busts?" Nissa let out an audible gulp at this stake.\
\
"Ok, but, if we do sell to someone, no matter the price, we shrink down
the same amount." Tiffany nodded.\
\
"Fair enough. You won\'t be able to go smaller than your current sizes,
I\'ll have you know." Sakura nodded, looking down at her straining blue
T-shirt, her bowling ball sized boobs pushing it to the limit.\
\
"Deal." Nissa let out a light "phew" hearing Sakura\'s side of the bet.\
\
"Wait a moment\...one final stake\..." Tiffany circled around the
counter and went over to the two, looking at their curves, then to their
faces. "If you raise as much as I do in an average day, it\'ll all go
away, no questions asked\...but\...if you fail to do so\...you keep
whatever you gain\...forever" Nissa\'s eyes went wide and the panic hit
her again.\
\
"Deal!" Sakura said with added vigor.\
\
"Kuraaaaa\..." Nissa muttered worriedly in her friend\'s ear.\
\
"We got this Nissa\...this\'ll be a piece of cake, ok?" She whispered
back in her worried, peach-haired pal. "Two against one, we\'ll sell
plenty, alright?" Nissa nodded, still a bit worried about this
proposal.\
\
"OK\...deal\..." Nissa said to Tiffany with a mild tremble in her voice.
Tiffany clapped her hands together and smiled.\
\
"Wait." Sakura said as she thought more about the bet. "If we win\...you
gotta grow yourself." Tiffany raised an eyebrow at this.\
\
"You think I don\'t LIKE growing dear?" Sakura faltered a bit at this
statement, but tried pressing on with her side of the bet.\
\
"Fine\...then Nissa and I both get to pick whatever we want from the
store and use it on you tomorrow\...Whit will help us figure out what
works where. And if it has permanent effects, you\'ll just have to go
with it." Tiffany shuffled her feet a bit at this, but still nodded.\
\
"Fine then. Stakes are set." Whit floated down from a bookshelf,
eavesdropping on the whole conversation.\
\
"Fascinating stuff, ladies. How about I be referee in this little sport
of yours?" He said with a hint of deviousness. "I make sure everyone\'s
playing fair. No shoving money into the till or stealing from customers.
I\'ll count the money up after its all over, just to make sure Tiff
doesn\'t fudge numbers-"\
\
"Like I would, Whit!" Whit giggled at Tiffany\'s reaction and floated
down to her bosom, patting it a few times.\
\
"You know as much as I do that this is your ideal size\...you\'d destroy
anyone who would try to change them\...or sabotage their
plans\...hehehe\..." Tiffany went a light shade of red, pushing her
glasses up the bridge of her nose.\
\
"Oh\...alright\...fine, you can ref Whit\...but don\'t you mess with
anything while you\'re doing it!" Whit smiled and floated over to Sakura
and Nissa. \
\
"Trust me Crimson\...either result of this bet will be\...very
entertaining for me\...heheheee\..." He said without shame. Nissa went a
bit red at the idea of some pervy sack doll staring at her boobs, and
crossed her arms across her chest in an attempt to hide them. \
\
"Alright\...let\'s open up then\..." She walked over to the door,
stopping between Niss and Kura as Whit floated over to the registers.
She leaned in close to them and lowered her voice. "he\'s not usually
like that, by the way. I think he just loses his senses when exposed to
too much tit flesh. So don\'t pay much mind to him right now\...he\'ll
adjust eventually." She resumed her trip to the door and switched the
sign from closed to open.\
\
The bet was on.\
\
Sakura waved Nissa over to the register and began planning.\
\
"Alright, you know how to run a cash register, right?" Nissa looked at
the small, computer-like device and shrugged.\
\
"Umm\...I haven\'t used one, but\...I think I can figure it out\..."
Sakura studied it and saw it to be pretty basic. Buttons that were
clearly marked "TOTAL", "ENTER", "CASH", "DEBIT/CREDIT", as well as
others were displayed. \
\
"I\'m sure you\'ll be fine Niss. Now then, for the first half of the
shift, before break, you control the registers, and I\'ll work the
floor. After break, we swap places. Sound ok?" Nissa nodded and they
went into action, though no one had entered yet, so they had to stand
around a bit, Nissa cleaning up the front a bit and Sakura adjusting the
aisles as necessary.\
\
"You gave yourself quite the challenge, Blue." Whit called down from the
top of a display. "Even though you haven\'t seen it, Tiffany is quite
the sales lady. Its not gonna be easy to meet her sales." \
\
"Pssh, it can\'t be THAT hard to sell this stuff\...girls go crazy after
cheap jewelry all the time, anyways."\
\
"You are aware that people know that this is a magic place right? Women
and men alike come here to get that \'magic boost\' to their bodies. To
some people, its nothing more than an ordinary antique store\...but to
many, its the place where their apparent dreams come true\..." He hopped
down onto Sakura\'s boobs and landed with a "plop", her bosom bobbing
about in response. "\...and most of the time, they get more what they
are bargaining for." He winked, then floated back off of her chest and
onto the top of a bookcase, playing dead as he heard a chime ring, a
person entering the store.\
\
Sakura rounded the aisle and greeted the customer. It was a couple. One,
a flat chested but very cute blonde woman with her good-looking
boyfriend.\
\
"Hello! Welcome in!" Nissa said with her trademark sweet smile. The
woman\'s boyfriend nearly tripped over his own feet when he caught sight
of Nissa, her massive hips swaying left and right as she stepped over to
the registers, continuing her cleaning. Soon, Sakura had made her way
back to the front to greet the new customers.\
\
"Is there anything we can help you with today?" The man\'s eyes almost
fell out of his head at the sight of Sakura, much to the annoyance of
his girlfriend. He managed to notice her glare and collected himself,
clearing his throat.\
\
"Yes, well\...we had heard from a friend of mine that you sell a certain
type of\...charm here\..." The woman explained, keeping an eye on her
boyfriend to make sure he was behaving.\
\
"Well\...we sell many types of charms here\...is there anything specific
that I can help you find?" The woman a shade of pink and looked away for
a moment, then crossed her arms across her chest nervously. Sakura took
notice of this and nodded. "Ah, I see. Come with me." With that, they
were off into another section of the store to find something suitable. \
\
They stepped over to the jewelry section, Sakura eying the many various
knick-knacks and items -- jewels, porcelain figures, wooden totems, and
so much more. The man picked up a ring and showed it to his girlfriend.
It was a solid band of blue, smooth like marble.\
\
"How about this babe\...?" The woman took it and looked at Sakura.\
\
"So will these\...help\...?" Sakura looked at the ring and scratched her
head.\
\
"Well\...I can\'t say that every single thing in here will make
you\...better\..." Sakura tried to remain vague out of respect of the
woman\'s embarrassment. "But\...I can say that many, many of the things
do\..."\
\
"Can I test it\...?" Sakura shook her head.\
\
"The concept of \'you test it, you buy it\' sort of applies, I\'m
afraid."\
\
"Why\'s that?" The woman asked with a suspicious glance.\
\
"Just a rule my manager holds people to." The woman gazed at the ring.\
\
"Are returns possible?" Sakura nodded.\
\
"After 30 days of ownership, you can return it.\
\
"Weird\...don\'t you mean before?" Sakura shook her head.\
\
"Different sorts of things, so there\'s different rules." Sakura was
glad that Tiffany had told her all this stuff the first day. She\'d be
lost with all these questions without it!\
\
Meanwhile, back at the front of the store, a woman walked in. Long, red
hair and a peaceful disposition, she stepped in, looking around the
store.\
\
"Hello! Welcome in!" Nissa greeted her. The woman smiled and waved back,
not off put by Nissa\'s figure. Then again, her lower half was hidden by
the counter. The woman poked around a bit, not looking anywhere in
particular, then swiftly exited.\
\
\'Shoot! She must not have been inter\...\' Nissa\'s thoughts were
interrupted by a light grumble in her boobs and booty. \'Oh no! Its
starting\...\' She felt them puff out just a little, her clothes
straining just a bit outwards, giving audible creaks.
\'Oooh\...hopefully that doesn\'t happen anymore\...I gotta try
harder\...bring out the saleswoman Nissa!\' With new fueled
determination, Nissa anxiously awaited the next customer.\
\
Sakura suddenly clenched onto her bosom as it puffed out a solid inch,
her shirt climbing up her stomach, its hem now near the very top of her
jeans. \'Shit\...we must\'ve had a window shopper come in\...\' The
couple took no notice as they were debating the price of the ring with
one another. At last, they came to a decision and made their way up to
the counter after browsing a bit first. They paid for the ring, then
exited, obviously excited to try it out.\
\
Nissa and Sakura both waited to deflate, but nothing happened.\
\
\'What the hell? Tiffany! You\'re not holding up your side of the deal!"
Suddenly, Whit flew over, landing on Sakura\'s bust once again. \
\
"Remember, the deal is that EVERY customer has to pay for something.
That\'s the spoken agreement. Since the man didn\'t buy anything,
technically, the two parts of the bet negated each other." Sakura rubbed
her swollen bottom and frowned. Sakura groaned in frustration.\
\
"Fine. We\'ll be more careful then."\
\
Continues continued to occasionally trickle in. With every one that
entered, Sakura or Nissa were able to pull off some sort of charm.
Sakura displaying her bosom casually and saying that she was "living
proof", Nissa with her cheery disposition and innocent charm was able to
win over men and women alike. Soon, they were selling to people at a
pretty consistent pace, had lost what little they had gained on their
bodies, and wee growing no more.\
\
"God, we are KILLING it, Niss!" Sakura said with a smile, the day only
half over. Break time was near, and it was almost time to switch
positions.\
\
"You guys certainly learn quick. You picked up some skill out of
nowhere! I\'m really impressed, you two." Chimed Whit, who still rested
on a high shelf.\
\
"Thanks Whitty." Nissa beamed over at him, and he nodded, smiling back
at her. Soon, break time came, and they switched places afterward, Nissa
now on the sales floor, Sakura on the registers.\
\
"Pssh, man, this till is SO easy compared to Danny Dee\'s system\..."
Sakura said with a smirk, getting familiarized with the buttons. A few
more customers walked in. Another couple, and a few men in thick jackets
with their hoods on. Sakura eyed them curiously, saying nothing. "You
should probably keep an eye on them\...they look kind of sneaky\..."
Sakura muttered over to Nissa, who nodded and made her way to the shady
looking characters. She tried to make herself look casual, fixing up
some of the books while keeping an eye on the two men. But as she did
this, she couldn\'t help but notice that their eyes were more fixated on
her than the merchandise.\
\
"Need help with that, lady?" One of them asked her in a gruff voice as
she attempted to put a book back in the shelf. Nissa shook her head.\
\
"No thank you, I believe I\'ve got it\..." She pushed them back in, her
booty jiggling slightly as she lifted herself up, trying to get further
up. \
\
"Man, Tom wasn\'t kidding when he said she had the biggest rear he had
ever seen\..." Nissa could barely heard it, and she didn\'t want to
believe he had said it, but he had. Se immediately flushed and paused,
but tried to get back to distracting herself with the books, going for
ones that exclusively went on middle shelves. She heard them step
towards her, the men having an awful stench surrounding them that Nissa
couldn\'t describe.\
\
"You sure we don\'t need help lady? We can\...give you whatever you
need\..." The man said with a creepy smile. \
\
"N-no\...I\'m fine\..." Nissa said back uneasily, getting a bit nervous
around the two off-putting men. They were still drawing closer, putting
their arms out a bit, reaching towards Nissa and her massive\--\
\
\*\*THWAP!\*\* \
\
A small stone was sent flying into the back of the man\'s head, just
hard enough to knock him over. Nissa let out an "eep!" and stepped out
of the way. At the end of the aisle was Sakura, a look of contempt
across her face.\
\
"Hey! We don\'t allow the likes of you in here! Take off right now!"
Sakura said, enunciating the "right now" as much as she could. The men
stood and rushed towards the end of the aisle, not even looking back at
Sakura. He brought his friend with him, and neither said anything more,
making their way out in no time flat. As soon as they stepped out, the
warmth came over Sakura and Nissa as they felt their bodies both expand
outwards. Nissa\'s behind ballooned out and inch, and broke through an F
cup in no time, while Sakura\'s breasts seemed to be putting her shirt
under traumatic pressure, reaching K cups, rivaling soccer balls.\
\
"Oof\...why the hell is your ass growing\...and why am I getting so
big?" Sakura asked, rubbing her large bosom in confusion. Nissa
shrugged, just as confused.\
\
"We can ask Tiffany\..." As she said this, Whit flew over, landing on
Sakura\'s chest. \
\
"Afraid not, ladies. Tiffany is off the grid for the day. In the back
preparing some potions and charms to sell. Just get to the end of the
day on your own, ladies!" He patted Sakura\'s breasts one last time,
letting them jiggle about before floating back up to the shelves, not to
be seen by either of them.\
\
"Great\...no answers until later, I guess\..." Sakura looked back up, a
passion in her eyes. "Let\'s finish this day strong, Niss!" Nissa nodded
rapidly, then raised her fist like Sakura.\
\
"Right!" They both went back to what they were doing, getting customer
after customer. Some were couples, some were single women or men with
varying reasons. Some were just passing by and wanted to look to see
what they had. \
\
"Ooh, these would be cute together!" Nissa pointed out, handing a woman
a jade necklace and bracelet. The woman nodded, agreed with Nissa and
bought them both without question.\
\
"Jeez Nissa, I never thought you were such a saleswoman." Sakura
remarked, watching Nissa sway back and forth over to the bookshelves.\
\
"Hehe, I\'m just being honest." Nissa said as she continued to fix up
the store. "There\'s so much in here\...and I just see things that work
together. Stuff that I kinda like, stuff I think look good on other
people."\
\
"Well, you are the fashion model." Sakura said with a wink.\
\
"I\'m a photographer first, Kura." Nissa corrected her. "I like modeling
and all, but I got into it for the photography." Sakura laughed at her
friend\'s mild seriousness.\
\
"I know Niss! I\'m just saying you have an eye for design, that\'s
all." \
\
"Oh! S\...sorry\..." Nissa laughed nervously and blushed.\
\
Suddenly, two women walked in. Both were fairly heavy, and looked very
unkempt, hair frazzled and skin riddled with scars. \
\
\"Alright, we\'re only in here for a little while, ok? You can look
around, but don\'t touch anything!!" One of the women shouted over as 10
or 15 teenagers stepped in behind them. Nissa and Sakura\'s stomachs
dropped, their nerves now at fever pitch.\
\
"This\...might not be good\..." The young\'uns spread across the store
into various aisles, looking over the merchandise. The two women seemed
to be poring over some of the jewelry, trying to find something that
they didn\'t think was "disgustingly tacky". Nissa and Sakura just stood
there in worry, not knowing exactly what to do. One of the women looked
over t them and nearly lost her eyeballs from how much they popped out
of her head.\
\
"Hey Lucy! Get a load of this!" She shouted over to her friend. They
both waddled over, breathing slightly labored even though little to no
effort had been put into walking.\
\
"Goodness\...look at these bimbos\..." One of them remarked to her
friend. \
\
"God, what is this, a hooker convention in a antique store? Weird
combination\..."\
\
This took Sakura off guard. People actually talk like this about others
when they were standing in front of them?! Even at Danny Dees, she had
never encountered this. This made her blood boil. Nissa stared at them
with a distant, shamed look on her face, every sentence they muttered at
each other while looking around the store, pretending that the ridiculed
couldn\'t hear them, made her recede more and more into a distant sort
of mindset.\
\
"What the hell do you think you\'re doing?!" Sakura finally spoke up.
"You can\'t talk about my friend and I like that! Just who the hell do
you think-"\
\
"Ooh, look at you all high and mighty!" One of them stepped over close
to Sakura, her big belly bumping against Sakura\'s I cups (they had sold
enough for them to both go back to base size). "You bimbo types are all
the same: try to act all deep and emotional, but you\'re nothing but
shallow sluts inside."\
\
"You tell em Lucy! I grew up surrounded by you harlots all throughout
school. Was always the same."\
\
"Step off! You don\'t know us!" Sakura spat back, now getting incredibly
frustrated. The children that accompanied them continued to run around
the store, ignoring the scene entirely. \
\
"Bimbos like you are all the same! Shallow, sex-driven,
show-offs\...thinking you\'re better cuz you got a big pair a titties-"\
\
"And a beer gut is SO attractive, isn\'t it?" Sakura turned her head to
see Tiffany saunter out, an irritated look on her face, but still
wearing a smug sort of smile. \
\
"Well shit! We gots us another one! I guess this place doubles as a
titty bar-"\
\
"Ladies, I own this establishment. If all you\'re going to do is poke
fun at my employees, I insist that you get out immediately\..." She
stepped up to one of them and gave them a death stare. "\...or I\'ll
have to use force\..." She smacked her in the fat belly and it jiggled
about.\
\
"Oh rea-" the woman suddenly smacked into the floor, her belly now
incredibly heavy out of nowhere, her legs no longer able to support her
girth. "What the hell\...did you do\..." Tiffany lifted the woman\'s
chin and looked back into her eyes.\
\
"My dear, beauty comes in all sizes. But it only comes from care.
You\'ve made it quite obvious about your rebellion towards physical
beauty, both inside and out. I believe that revokes your ability to
judge it. I suggest you leave before you cause you or your friend
anymore harm-"\
\
"GET AWAY FROM MAH SISTER!" The other woman roared as she picked up a
chair, ready to slam Tiffany over the head with it. Tiffany merely
snapped her fingers, the woman suddenly bloating up like a ball, her
arms and legs receding into the girth. Her hands and feet stuck out of
her like stubs and she rolled onto her back. Tiffany\'s eyebrow twitched
in annoyance.\
\
"Its obvious that you two\...neanderthals\...have no right to even be
inside of my store. I suggest you leave immediately. And take
your\...children with you." The kids were now paying full attention,
seeing their "parents" being transformed had them all transfixed and
slightly afraid. Tiffany snapped her fingers and the women returned to
normal. Without a word, they beckoned their children to them, worried
looks across their faces, and huddled their way out of the store.\
\
Sakura let out a sigh of relief, happy that Tiffany had appeared to
assist them. Nissa was still shaken, but shook her head and snapped out
of it.\
\
"Thank you Tiff\...I\'m sorry that happened\..." Tiffany sighed as well,
picking up the chair the other woman had grabbed and returning it to its
place.\
\
"Not your fault dear. I\'m surprised by the audacity of such people in
this day and age. How blunt and rude they can be. Its really gotten
worse over the years\..." She looked back at Sakura and Niss and shook
her head, pushing her glasses back up the bridge of her nose. "You two
alright?" Both of them nodded. Something suddenly occurred to Sakura.\
\
"Wait\...we failed to sell to like\...15 people, how come we didn\'t
grow?"\
\
"Also, why is my bottom growing, I thought it was just supposed to
happen to my boobies?" Nissa pointed out, squishing her index fingers
into her plump E cups.\
\
"Ah, well, you see, I was doing some research and\..."\
\
\*grumble\*\
\
"Huh?" Sakura looked down at her chest and saw it wiggle all on its own,
shaking and lurching inside her too-tight T-shirt. "Oh that can\'t be
gOOOOHH-" Her boobs suddenly pushed out several inches, straining her
shirt to the max. \
\
"EEEEEEE\...!" Nissa let out a high pitched squeal as her breasts
ballooned, her hips flared outwards and her ass puffed forward. She
wobbled backwards as inch after inch of flesh was added onto her body.
"OOOOH GOODNESS! SO MUUUHCHH\..."\
\
\*creaaaak\...\*\
\
Their clothing audibly protested the rapid growth as Sakura\'s breasts
grew past basketball in size, then medicine balls, more and more
outwards. Tiffany merely watched and giggled, sitting down on the chair
behind her and enjoying the show.\
\
"My my, you girls sure do love to have fun, don\'t you?" \
\
"Mmmmm\...it feels\...make it stoooop\..." Nissa begged, her panties
riding up her bottom and slipping up her butt cheeks. Her yoga pants
climbed higher and higher up her legs, more and more fabric used to
covering her wide hips and fat cheeks. They were as big as bean bag
chairs and still growing by the second. Her breasts weren\'t nearly as
large as Sakura\'s, but were about as big as they were at Sakura\'s base
size: H cups. And still growing more and more.\
\
Sakura\'s growth had hit overdrive. They were now bigger than Nissa\'s
ass and into novelty beach ball territory, then yoga balls. She plopped
onto the ground as her t-shirt, which was merely a strip across her
nipples at this point, finally gave weigh, tearing at the seams as she
moaned in pleasure. Nissa swiveled her big booty around and knocked over
a potted plant nearby, causing it to smash on the ground. Her yoga pants
had finally tore all the way apart, leaving nothing to the imagination.
She brought her hands over herself to keep herself decent as her boobs
reached the size of basketballs.\
\
"Careful ladies! Don\'t cause me too much damage! I don\'t want to
charge you more." Tiffany said with a sly smile. "Or do I\...?" \
\
On and on the girls\' curves flourished, Sakura\'s boobs now as big as
her own body, Nissa\'s hips nearly 4 feet wide with a booty to match.
She had flopped down upon it in exhaustion.\
\
"THIS IS THE SECOND TIME WITHIN TWO DAYS TIFF!" Sakura shouted as her
breasts began to lift her small body from the ground. Tiffany
snickered.\
\
"You were the one that wanted to bet, dear, not me." Sakura hung her
head, knowing that Tiffany was correct. Soon the growth had slowed, and
had come to a stop. They laid there for a moment, a thought dawning upon
Sakura in fear.\
\
"Oh God\...I hope we sold enough\...or else\..."\
\
"Or else life is going to be rather difficult for you two, isn\'t it?"
Tiffany finished for her, going over to the store door and switching the
sign to closed. She walked back over to the registers and pulled them
out, handing them over to Whit.\
\
"Your turn Whit. Go on and count what they got.\
\
After a few minutes of waiting, Sakura and Nissa planted to the spot,
Whit had finally tallied the money, and spoke up the results.\
\
"Today we earned \$11,960.22!" Sakura and Nissa looked up, with a
hopeful glint in their eyes.\
\
"Is that\...a lot\...?" Tiffany began to snicker, which soon evolved
into a huge laugh.\
\
"I\'m afraid not dears\...on an average day, I make around \$12,000.
Just ask Whit." She leaned onto one of Sakura\'s breasts and sighed
peacefully. "I\'m afraid you two lose. Don\'t worry, I\'ll reduce you so
you can walk again\...but you get to keep most of what you-"\
\
"Actually, Crimson\..." Whit chimed in, floating up and landing on
Sakura\'s enormous jugs. He had been so distracted with the bet that he
hardly had took the time to revel in their massive size. "I believe
you\'re over-simplifying it just a bit. It is true you make that much on
an average day\...but let\'s be fair here: with how many customers they
had, which was\..." He looked over at the computer, then  floated back
over. "57, and we take the average from that\..." Whit continued with
some math jargon, which left Tiffany giving him a stony glare, which he
ignored."Which means that, on an average day LIKE THIS, they made
SIGNIFICANTLY more than you do. By about a grand. So\...they technically
win." Sakura and Nissa both bounced on their excessive flesh jovially,
big smiles on their faces, Sakura letting off an air of "I told you
so".\
\
"Eat that Tiffany!" Kura said with a tone of playfulness. \
\
"Whit\...I hate you\...so so much right now\..." Whit shrugged.\
\
"I\'m just being fair, Crimson. Its what you asked me to do." Tiffany
groaned and snapped her fingers, letting them both deflate in no time at
all. She snapped again and their clothes re-assembled, though they were
slightly smaller on their bodies than they remembered. \
\
"Alright\...fine\...go pick out one thing a piece and you can use it on
me tomorrow\...I also have something to explain to you two afterward.
After that\...you\'re both free." She stepped away to the back of the
store, but looked back with a curt smile. "Oh\...and good job you
two\..." With that, she stepped back into the room, leaving Nissa and
Sakura to look about the store, finding the most obscure items they
could imagine.\
\
\*\*Day 7: The Last Day\...?\*\*\
\
Nissa and Sakura entered the building, their bodies deflating as they
entered. Nissa giggled.\
\
"Last day that that will ever happen\..." Nissa said. Sakura nodded.\
\
"About time\...feels like forever that we\'ve been working here\..."
Sakura said with an exhausted tone.\
\
"Yeah\...its been pretty bad\..." Nissa admitted, making her way to the
back of the store to put away her belongings.\
\
"Well\...not really\..." Sakura joined her, putting her purse down into
a cabinet, but shoving her cell phone down her pocket of cleavage.
"Yeah\...we grew\...but the only stuff that stuck around was the stuff
we did ourselves. Everything else Tiffany was able to get rid of right
away. Yesterday was crazy, but that was mostly my fault anyways\..."
Nissa shrugged.\
\
"This place still makes me uneasy, kinda\...just\...with those guys\..."
Sakura nodded in an understanding way.\
\
"I get it Nissa. I\'m here for you though, alright?" Nissa smiled back
at her friend appreciatively.\
\
"Alright\...well\...let\'s get this over with\..." Tiffany said as she
stepped out into the room. Sakura grinned mischievously as she pulled
out the two items Nissa and her had picked up the other day. "before we
do, I need to tell you both something.\" She sat in a wooden chair and
gestured for the ladies to walk towards her. "I studied those spells a
little more in depth and discovered something\...rather interesting. As
it turns out, the spell made your bodies into a sort of\...magical
sponge. You see, Sakura, the reason your breasts grew so large yesterday
is because any magic directed into them is strengthened by an unending
supply of magic radiation. The same applies to your bottom, Nissa, and
that is why you grew the way you did." Nissa and Sakura nodded
hesitantly.\
\
"So\...what does that mean for us in the future?" Sakura asked. Tiffany
shrugged.\
\
"It depends, really. If you keep away from all kinds of magic, you\'ll
both never really have to worry about it. Your friend Mano is on my
watch list, so I\'m sure you both won\'t need to worry as much about
that sort of stuff."\
\
"I appreciate you doing that for us." Nissa said sweetly. Tiffany shot
her a look.\
\
"Well\...let\'s make something clear here. What I did was not exactly
for you ladies\...it was for my magic. I was tired of seeing it abused.
But\..." She smiled again, then stood, bringing them both together in
group hug. She stepped back and continued, both girls rather confused by
her sudden actions. "I must admit, this past week has been\...rather
fun, really. I haven\'t really had many people to talk to on a regular
basis, aside from Whit. And he can be a bit\...much sometimes."\
\
"Hello Blue!" Whit shouted as he dropped directly into her cleavage out
of nowhere. There was a stunned silence for a moment as Tiffany glared
at him. He stared awkwardly back. \"Wait, Crimson lemme ex-"\
\
"Go to your room."\
\
"It was an accident, I fell-"\
\
"Room. Now."\
\
"Oh cmon Cr-"\
\
"ROOM WHIT!" Tiffany nearly shouted, pointing to the counter. Whit hung
his head and floated out of Sakura\'s bosom, gently dropping into an
open shelf, curling up inside of it, as Tiffany closed it gently.\
\
"Oh\...jeez, Tiff, that\'s a bit-"\
\
"He actually chose it himself. He likes\...enclosed spaces\..." She
pressed her fingers on her temples and collected her thoughts. "Now
then\...I suppose we had a deal\...you\'ve picked your poison, I
assume?" Both Sakura and Nissa nodded. Sakura pulled out a long, silver
staff. It was hooked at the top, with an emerald encrusted on its top.
Tiffany let out a laugh.\
\
"Good job dear! You picked out one of the non-magical things from my
collection!"\
\
"Aw, what? I thought everything was\..." Tiffany shook her head.\
\
"Don\'t be silly dear, I still buy ordinary things from people if the
price is right. Alright, Nissa hun, what do you ha-" She stopped short
when she saw a small, smooth blue rock resting in Nissa\'s hands.\
\
"It looked pretty\..." Tiffany let out a "gulp" as she observed it, and
lifted it from Nissa\'s palm, setting on an end table nearby.\
\
"Had to be one of these\...didn\'t it\..." She closed her eyes and held
it in her hand, directing it towards Sakura, and it let out a glow.\
\
She stifled a moan as her hips flared outwards, causing the chair
beneath her to creak slightly under the added weight.
"Great\...just\...peachy\..." She stood, letting her booty wobble a bit
as it continued to blossom. Tiffany didn\'t have much to show before,
but this was slowly changing by the second. \
\
"What was it supposed to do\...?" Nissa asked as she observed Tiffany\'s
plush thighs getting wider and wider, touching each other more and more
by the moment.\
\
"It\...mirrors the posterior of the target\..." She chuckled, but tried
to suppress another moan as her booty continued to swell. "I chose the
lesser of two evils\...dammit\..." She rubbed her bottom as the growth
slowed down, now the size of Sakura\'s foot-and-a-half wide caboose.
"Had to be a semi-permanent one\...out of all the things I sell\..." She
sighed and picked it up. As she did, she accidentally turned to Nissa,
who had begun moving without her noticing. It let out a glow from her
palm\
\
"SHIT NOOOoooohhh!" Tiffany dropped it to the floor as her butt
continued its growth, getting more and more bloated. Sakura couldn\'t
help but let out a laugh as she watched the spellcrafter\'s booty begin
to make her pants tear. "Stupid rock\...why did I even make one like
thisss\..." Inch after inch was added on, her booty flaring out and
finally causing her panties to become a thong under her tight black
jeans. Her cheeks muffined out of her pants, now letting off a decent
amount of butt cleavage. The threads strained on her pants, holes
appearing on the seams of the legs.\
\
She looked down. Her butt was enormous. Larger than she had ever been in
her butt. She sighed as the last half an inch was put on, her booty now
as impressive as Nissa\'s at 2 feet wide. She was soft and squishy on
two sides, her waist still incredibly thin compared to the rest of her.
She picked up the stone again, now careful enough to set it down in a
cabinet quickly before any more damage was done, and sat back down,
feeling herself wobble a bit as her butt flesh seeped over the edges of
her chair.\
\
"So this is what its like to have your butt, is it dear?" Nissa looked
at her and blinked.\
\
"I\...guess so\...?" Tiffany chuckled, then rubbed the side of her ass.\
\
"Well\...give this a few years or so and it might go away\...that
particular charm has a timer release, where I\'ll shrink back down to
normal over time\...but I borked the timer a bit, and it takes\...much
longer than its supposed to. Guess I\'m stuck like this for a while\..."
She stood again, snapping at the door so the sign switched from closed
to open. "Anyways\...business as usual ladies! Let\'s get to it!" She
ordered, Sakura and Nissa nodding and obeying, cleaning the store and
rotating between cashiers.\
\
The day progressed with no mishaps, a generally relaxing day. No
perverts or horribly rude people. Just a subtle day at the Shop of
Oddities. \
\
The day came to a close, and Tiffany knew she had a few things left to
do before she could let them leave. With a snap of her fingers, Sakura
and Nissa felt their boobs and booties puff out an inch briefly, then go
back down as if they had taken a deep breath.\
\
\"There you are. The debt has been paid. You\'re both free now\..." She
said, a hint of sadness in her voice.\
\
"Well\...thank you Tiffany. We really appreciate everything you have
done for us." Sakura said, walking over and holding her hand out for
Tiffany. Tiffany looked down at it, smiled, then took it, shaking it
firmly. Nissa came over as well, skipping formalities and giving her a
hug. Tiffany gladly hugged back, their generous hips swaying back and
forth for a moment until they separated.\
\
"I was wondering, you two\..." She eyed them up and down, ready to let
out an idea she had been stewing over for a while. "If you wanted\...you
could work here. As paid employees, of course. I\'d meet any job that
you\'re working at in pay, and beat them, really. I could use some
permanent help like you two. What do you say?" Sakura thought about it.
Before she could make up her mind, Nissa chimed in.\
\
"I appreciate the offer, Tiffany\...but\...I\'m sorta working in what I
wanna do right now\..."\
\
"Ah yes\...of course\...photographer for models. I wouldn\'t pass that
up either, dear, I understand\..." She switched her gaze to Sakura. \
\
She stood there, weighing her options. Thinking of all the potentially
dangerous magical things within the store that could cause her permanent
growth\...the weirdos that could shop here\...\
\
"Couldn\'t be any worse that where I am now. And you say I get extra
pay?" Tiffany nodded.\
\
"And medical benefits, of course." Sakura was surprised by this. She
thought for a moment more, then nodded.\
\
"Alright." She said with a enthusiastic smile. Tiffany let out a light
"yes!" to herself. "I\'d love to work here, Tiffany."\
\
"Oh\...excellent! I promise dear, you won\'t regret it!"\

CH 3: After Effects 1

Nissa sighed contently as she sat on the couch, a strawberry smoothie in
hand. She took a sip, picking up the remote and changing the channel to
her favorite channel, one that displayed various current fashions and
trends among celebrities. \
\
"Ah\...its nice having the house to myself sometimes. I love Kura and
Mano and all\...but sometimes a girl just needs time to herself!" Nissa
talked to herself sweetly, taking a few more sips of her home made
smoothie. She continued to watch the program, getting a few ideas of
angles that models could be posed when being photographed, as well as
admiring the various new and interesting dresses that were being put on
display. Nissa took notice of a hot pink one that clung close to the
thin woman\'s body, the hem of the skirt resting on her thighs. Looking
down at her own body, observing her own legs and bottom, its flesh
pouring out across the seat of the couch. She shook her head and
continued to watch the show, taking a few more generous sips from her
smoothie.\
\
The show then went to commercial break. A few car commercials played, as
well as a phone commercial and other local commercials for plumbing and
roofing. Something about asbestos and lawsuits. Then a particular
commercial came on. Nissa had never seen this one before.\
\
"Tired of excess body fat? Do you have trouble getting from point A to
point B without knocking a few others?" It showed a black and whit
b-roll of overweight people unable to perform menial tasks. Nissa
watched on, her stress slowly rising. "Try new Body trim plus! This new
diet plan gets rid of all of that ugly excess body fat that no one ever
wants!" Nissa continued to sip her smoothie, chewing on her straw
nervously as she continued to watch the commercial. It displayed a few
people who had apparently used this weight loss "plan". \
\
"I was carrying SO much excess fat in my stomach and in my butt. It
looked awful. I lost 34 pounds on Body Trim plu-" Nissa turned the TV
off, putting her empty smoothie cup aside. She leaned back onto the
couch in a slump, then looked back down at her butt. Giving her large
booty a frown, she stood and went over to the kitchen. She caught her
reflection in the stainless steel refrigerator, it slightly pulled her
wider than she really was. Putting a hand on one of her hips, she bit
her lip and let out a slight whimper. \
\
"Its not\...that bad\...is it?" Nissa muttered to herself. Shaking her
head, determined to get her mind off of it, she opened the refrigerator
and began to pull out various foods from it: fried chicken from
yesterday, some left over pot roast, some pizza, and some meat loaf. She
opened the freezer and pulled out some more ice cream. Nissa knew she
didn\'t have the most healthy habits. Although it had never gone to her
belly, as it remained perfectly trim and thin, which only further
enhanced her hourglass figure. It never effected her breasts all that
much either. They weren\'t small by any means, being a nice perky E
cup\...but her ass had always suffered. With hips that measured about a
foot and a half wide, and a booty that stuck out like a shelf, Nissa
knew that her diet attributed to such a gargantuan posterior. \
\
But whenever she was stressed or anxious, her comfort was food. And not
just any food: fatty foods. Horribly unhealthy foods. Chips, candy,
burgers, fries, chicken, cakes and ice cream. Sometimes she couldn\'t
stop herself. Hours would go by and she would just eat and eat the day
away. It was never TOO much of an issue -- this was after years and
years of packing it on, and she was trying to exercise more frequently
with Kura. Though lately she had just been watching as she sat back and
danced to the music Kura would play while she worked out. \
\
Today was one of those bad days. That commercial really hit her hard.
The words "ugly" and "awful" had sunk in deep and began nagging her in
her brain. Sakura had told her many times that her butt was nothing
short of the sexiest she had ever seen. But even the thought of guys
staring at them and just seeing her butt and that was all\...it didn't
make her feel much better.\
\
After finishing off the last of the food she had pulled out, she went
and reclined on the couch, her belly sticking out just a bit from her
feast. She knew it would be back to normal by tomorrow, though. She
would pay for it then, she knew, but for now, she felt just a little
better than she did before. And there was no guilt to it, as the food
she ate were merely leftovers, and she had to go out shopping pretty
soon anyways.\
\
Just then, Mano and Sakura had arrived home, walking in, Sakura looking
slightly annoyed.\
\
"I don\'t see how its a contest, Mano\..." Mano snickered as they walked
in, locking the door behind her.\
\
"I\'m just saying, we really need to start a bust Olympics sometime.
Make a bunch of big booby events. Imagine pole vaulting or long jumping
with those things, using them as the landing cushions! Like airbags!
Ha!" Sakura whipped around, setting her shopping bags on the floor.\
\
"Shut it Mano. You\'re lucky you can even move around with those things!
I would\'ve thought that you could at least relate to what I go through
every day\..." Mano shrugged and set her bags down as well.\
\
"I guess. No idea how your spine is still intact. But I\'m sure that
Tiffany bitch made mine heavier on purpose." She said as she hefted her
K cup breasts in her hands and shaking them about, sending them on a
jiggle spree. She set them down gently, as to not fall on her face from
the weight.\
\
"Don\'t call Tiffany a bitch, OK? She\'s actually a really nice woman
when you get to know her. Right Niss?" Nissa didn\'t respond. She had
begun clenching her stomach and wincing. Sakura took notice and walked
over to the couch. "Jeez, you alright Nissa?" Nissa nodded, getting to a
standing position, still crouched a bit, gripping her stomach.\
\
"Ooooh\...I just ate a bit too much, that\'s all. I\'m gonna go lie down
for a bit\..." She stumbled over to her room and shut the door. Sakura
let out a sigh and shook her head.\
\
"Hope she\'ll be alright. She must be stressed about something\..."\
\
"Can\'t imagine what. She was just sitting on her big ass the whole time
we were gone." Mano retorted, pulling out the bras and taking the tags
off.\
\
"You don\'t know that Mano, alright? Something might have happened while
we were out." She stepped over and began to help. "I\'ll ask in the
morning." Mano sighed as well, folding up the bras and setting them
aside.\
\
"Yeah\...guess you may have a point." Sakura was almost surprised by
this statement, but merely nodded. "Want me to check on her?" Mano asked
as she headed to her room to put her bras away. Sakura shook her head.\
\
"Let her sleep it off. She\'ll be better in the morning." Mano nodded
and headed off, leaving Sakura to fold her own bras. It was a bit more
difficult, taking in account her I cup breasts getting in the way, but
she managed to get it done, leaving Nissa to sleep off whatever was
bothering her. \
\
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--\
\
Nissa\'s sleep was restless. She tossed and turned, her body hot and
sweaty. She was wrapped up in a messy cocoon, trying to subconsciously
get them off of her so she could relieve herself of the heat. In this
struggle, she fell off the bed, the sheets finally gone from her body,
and she landed chest first with an "oof!". She laid there a moment, the
sun\'s rays flitting in from the blinds. She opened her eyes groggily,
blinking a few times, then tried to lift herself up. To her surprise,
she couldn\'t lift her own weight, and collapsed back down.\
\
She wrote it off as being tired, and laid there a minute more before
trying again. She still struggled under the weight. \
\
"Unnhh\...was I always this heavy? I know my butt is big, but\..." She
turned to look over her shoulder and couldn\'t believe what she saw. She
let out a loud, high pitched squeal as she gazed upon her now much
larger tush. The stitching of her bedtime booty shorts was ripping at
the seams, and the edges of the legs had crawled up her bottom, making
them look more like underwear than shorts. "Oh God! I didn\'t have that
big of a butt last time I checked\..." She reached back and poked them
delicately with one finger, feeling it sink down into her supple flesh.\
\
"Oh\...I\'m not dreaming am I\...?" She began to rock herself back and
forth a few times until finally rolling back onto her titanic backside.
"That\...that\'s real. That\'s all me\..." She felt tears began to well
up as the situation began to dawn on her. Her butt was enormous. Her
hips had flared out a good two inches or so as well. Nissa shakily got
to her feet, the weight now not as hard to carry when taken through her
large, strong legs. Her thighs were thick and able to handle the weight.
Now that she could stand, she hesitantly walked over to the standing
mirror she kept in her room. She gawked at her reflection, her hips now
broader than her shoulders. She turned to the side and saw her ass stick
out more than half a foot behind her. "This is\...oh my goodness!" Nissa
now had tears rolling down her cheeks. She was already so big before!
And now\...now she was even bigger! All because she had eaten so much
yesterday. But she had eaten like that before and had never gotten this
much gained in one night. How was this even possible?\
\
Sakura soon came bursting through her door.\
\
"Nissa! What\'s going ohmygod!" Sakura yelled as she caught a glimpse of
Nissa\'s now even more monolithic rump. "H-how\...when\...is that
even\...what happened Nissa?!" Sakura managed to sputter out her
question. Nissa shook her head in disbelief, tears running down her
cheeks as raised her delicate hands up, balled into fists.\
\
"I don\'t know\...I just\...I woke up and\...OH KURA!" She wobbled over
to her friend and rested her face on her shoulder, weeping from shock.
Sakura patted her head reassuringly, whispering to her friend to calm
her down.\
\
"There there Niss\...its ok\...just\...breathe, ok? Its gonna be
ok\...its not that bad\..." Nissa choked out a few sobs, then sniffled,
lifting her head and looking back down at herself.\
\
It was obvious that she had packed on no weight to her belly, but down
further than that was an entirely different story -- Her hips, which
were once only a foot and a half wide, now stretched out a little over
two feet. Her cheeks were like a shelf, and stuck out further than the
back of her head. \
\
A thought immediately occurred to Sakura.\
\
"MANO! GET OVER HERE!" They both waited a few seconds, the situations
till sinking in, as Mano finally made her way to Nissa\'s doorway,
groggily looking over, her eyes halfway shut.\
\
"Wuzzat?" Wut\'s goin\' on?" She asked drearily, looking at the back of
Sakura\'s head. Sakura stepped out of the way and held her hand out
towards Nissa\'s rear, as if to display it.\
\
"Explain this." Mano\'s eyes immediately went wide as she stared upon
Nissa\'s grand booty. The accusation then clicked in her mind and she
waved her hands in defense.\
\
"Don\'t look at me! I didn\'t do nothing!" Sakura gave her a harsh
glare. Mano glared back. "Do you really think I would be able to WALK
right now if I did? That Tiffany lady would have made my tits the size
of me if I tried anything else, trust me." Sakura lessened her stare and
shrugged, knowing that Mano was probably right. \
\
"Ok\...well\...what did you do yesterday then, Nissa?" Nissa thought
back for a moment, then blushed a bit in embarrassment.\
\
"Well I uh\...I watched TV for a little while\...had some stuff to
eat\...that was about it\..."\
\
"What did you eat\...?" Sakura asked, needling for more information.\
\
"Umm\...some roast beef\...some chicken\...some pizza\..." She admitted
as she pushed her index fingers together nervously. "Maybe some ice
cream too\..."\
\
"Jesus Nissa! You\'re lucky it JUST goes to your ass!" Sakura brought
her forefinger and thumb up to her forehead and pinched lightly. "Look,
today, you\'re working out with me. We gotta exercise that thing down
before it gets out of hand!"\
\
"But\..." Nissa tried to argue. \
\
"No buts!" Mano snickered at this remark, and Sakura groaned at her
unintentional pun. "Just\...go get ready, ok? Get some yoga pants
on\...you have some that fit, right?" Nissa nodded, and they began their
workout preparations.\
\
After the exercise bikes had been brought out from the spare room, and
all other furniture had been pushed out of their way in the living room,
Sakura turned on the tunes and they began their routine. They started
with stretches and such. They didn\'t have the room (or the cash) for a
treadmill, so the bikes would have to do. Nissa squatted down on the
small bike seat, her ass barely able to fit on it, her soft flesh
pouring over the sides. She whimpered a bit at this, but shook it off,
putting her feet on the pedals and starting to pedal them slowly at
first, then with more fierce determination, getting into the fast paced
workout song playing in the room. She spent about 20 minutes cycling
through, her breasts bobbing left and right as each foot pedaled up and
down, up and down\...\
\
Next were bridges. Nissa laid flat on the floor, beginning to lift
herself from it. The goal was to get her butt completely off the ground
and into the air. Sakura realized that this was probably impossible at
this point, but she still wanted her to try. Nissa lifted her back from
the floor, her bum rising slowly off the ground. Its weight was
tremendous and it took a few tries until she finally got about 80% of
her plush tuckus off of the floor. After a few more reps of this, she
moved onto the next exercise.\
\
"Whew\...Kura, I\'m exhausted\..." Nissa complained slightly, wiping the
sweat from her brow. Sakura patted her on the back and smiled.\
\
"You\'re doing awesome! Just keep it up, ok? Push through the burn!" Lit
up by her friend\'s enthusiasm, Nissa\'s drive to work out was once
again re-ignited. She stood and began lunges, then squats. Leaning over,
she attempted to touch her toes to stretch herself back out and loosen
up again. As her massive behind stretched out behind her, Mano happened
to walk out. She caught a glimpse at Nissa performing several toe
touches and gave a sly glare, unnoticed by the two. She snuck up behind
Nissa as she leaned over. Quietly, carefully, she got
closer\...closer\...until\...\
\
"GRAB ASS!" She lunged her hands forward and pinched into Nissa\'s two
colossal cheeks.\
\
"EEP!" Sakura suddenly sat up and turned around, interrupted from her
squishy, boob-filled crunches by Mano\'s outburst.\
\
"MANO!" Nissa cried out and danced in place, her bosom bouncing about
wildly, her booty swaying this way and that. She rubbed the places where
Mano had pinched delicately.\
\
"Mano, what did I tell you about messing with us while we\'re working
out?" Mano shrugged innocently.\
\
"Can\'t remember. And really, I couldn\'t resist it. She was sticking it
out SO FAR!" She snickered and reached out again, in which Sakura
gripped onto her wrist mid way.\
\
"Mano. No. Please, leave Nissa alone." Mano didn\'t like Sakura\'s
sudden stern tone and pouted, reaching back and folding her arms under
her watermelon sized mams. \
\
"Fine\..." Mano began to walk away innocently, but as Sakura turned her
back, her sneaky grin returned, Nissa still not paying attention, trying
to focus back on working out. Mano stepped over quick, attempting to get
another pinch or two. But Kura caught her out of the corner of her eye.\
\
"DAMMIT MANO! I SAID ENOUGH!" Sakura turned and pointed, a small spark
shooting out from her finger and zapping Mano lightly, much to Sakura\'s
surprise.\
\
"OOF!" Mano stepped away from Nissa, collapsing onto her bottom. "What
the hell Kura? I was just having some fun\...what the hell did you d-"\
\
BWOOMPH!\
\
Mano\'s breasts suddenly jumped up a cup size, a full inch bigger
around, now L cups. She looked down in shock, then back up at Sakura.
Confusion turned to rage. "WHAT THE FUCK KURA?!" She tried to stand, but
the new weight made her collapse onto her engorged tits. "How did
you\...did that Tiffany bitch teach you expansion spells?" \
\
"N-no\...I have no idea\...that was just\..." Sakura looked at her hands
anxiously, then back at Mano, shaking her head. "Ugh! Its your fault for
messing with Nissa anyways Mano! Now get outta here like I asked and
leave us to work out in peace!" Mano managed to heft herself up onto her
feet and shuffled out, still in disbelief of the events that had
occurred.\
\
"I\'ll get you back for this, cow girl\..." Mano muttered under her
breath. Sakura paid no mind to Mano\'s mutterings and resumed her work
out. Nissa did as well, but she couldn\'t help but feel weary. \
\
"Umm\...Kura\...I gotta go\...use the ladies room real quick\...I\'ll
brb\..."\
\
"What did I tell you about text talk Nissa?" Sakura corrected her friend
as she stepped into the hallway.\
\
"I don\'t do it as much Sakura\...I\'m sorry\..."\
\
"It\'s alright\...hehe, I\'m messing with you!" Sakura winked and picked
up some 10 lb dumbbells. "Make it a quick break, ok?" Nissa nodded and
darted off to the restroom. As she finished her "little break", she
began to sneak somewhere else.\
\
Making sure Kura did not see her go in, she crept into the kitchen,
quietly opening the refrigerator and observing the contents within. She
then pulled out a Tupperware container. Inside was a small piece of
chocolate cake, leftover from a few days ago. She stared at it longingly
for a moment, knowing that it was a bad idea to indulge in such treats
whilst working out.\
\
"Ohh\...I\'m so hungry though\...one bite won\'t hurt\..." She opened
the lid carefully, as to not make too much noise, and pulled out a fork
from a drawer. Picking off a small piece, she lifted to her mouth and
savored it, the rich flavor and texture welcomed into her mouth.
"Mmmm\...sooo good\..." She absentmindedly plunged her fork back down
and brought another piece back up into her mouth. Then another. And
another. It was much too delicious for Nissa to resist\...she was on the
last bite\...\
\
That\'s hen Sakura stepped in. \
\
"Sheesh\...gotta get more water-" She stopped in place, seeing Nissa
lift the last piece of cake into her mouth, her eyes closed in bliss, in
another world created by the confection she was ingesting. "NISSA!"
Sakura yelled out at her in anger.\
\
Nissa nearly choked on the last piece as it went down, dropping the
Tupperware to the ground as it landed with a soft \'thud\'.\
\
"What the hell Nissa?! We were working out over there! And you just go
over here and eat a whole piece of cake? You couldn\'t have waited,
what, a few hours? Hell, half an hour?!" Sakura approached her friend
and looked at her with disapproving eyes. Nissa looked back in shame,
trying to avoid contact, her hands folded at her front.\
\
"I\...I just\...I couldn\'t help it\..." Sakura sighed and hung her
head, obviously frustrated by her friend\'s stature.\
\
"Nissa\...I think before you start exercising your body\...you need to
start exercising some self contro-"\
\
Sakura was cut off by a strange tingling in her bosom. "Wha?" Nissa felt
her stomach rumble, the cake already starting to hit her. This rumbling
passed quickly, though, and for some reason passed into her rear, her
booty jiggling all on its own for some reason. But Nissa knew. The
feeling was oddly familiar. Her eyes went wide and her hands went to her
hips\
\
"N\...NOOOUUUUHHH\..." Nissa cried out as her hips began to stretch
outwards, her butt puffing out slowly behind her, the white yoga pants
she had stretching to try and contain all the additional booty flesh
that began to accumulate. Millimeter by millimeter pressed out, Nissa\'
butt shaking mercilessly as it continued its assault outwards. "Why is
this happening? This is\...Sakura, help meeeeee!" Nissa cried out as her
ass began to press into the refrigerator behind her, her cheeks mashing
together as it grazed across the cold stainless steel. She began to rub
it up and down on it, the sensation oddly pleasing to her.\
\
Sakura, on the other hand, had her own problems to deal with. For some
odd reason, her nipples began to get hard. They made apparent forms
through her tight blue tank top. She could feel them pulsate, edging
outwards until they were a full centimeter long each. \
\
"Woah\...what the hell\...?" Sakura asked herself in puzzlement as she
felt her breasts gurgle and churn, a strange gurgling becoming audible
behind her walls of almost endless breast flesh. Soon, they began to
creep forwards, her cleavage lengthening and pushing up out of the
collar. They began to muffin, her already skin tight shirt cutting into
her skin and getting tighter as they continued their assault outwards.
Her bra began to pinch into her shoulders and she winced in annoyance.
"Goddammit\...I just bought new bras too\..." \
\
As fast as it came though, the growth spurt passed. Nissa, left with
little more than two feet wide hips and a juicy behind to match. Sakura
now had titanic J cups, matching Mano\'s old size. They were the size of
volleyballs and looked soft, squishy and pliable, her nipples still at
full attention.\
\
"Well\...\...\.....shit." Sakura cursed as she pulled out her phone from
her cleavage. It was a little tougher to find than she was used to. "You
alright Nissa?" Nissa looked over at her and nodded, still slightly in
shock. She had to lean on the refrigerator just to stay upright. Sakura
then dialed a number and held her cell phone up to her ear.
"Hey\...Tiffany? Its Kura. We need your help for a second\..."\
\
POOF!\
\
Out of nowhere, Tiffany appeared right on cue with a smile on her face.
She looked at them both and scrunched up her eyes, unclear if what she
was seeing was out of the ordinary or not. \
\
"Did you happen to-"\
\
"Yes, Tiffany, we grew again. Can you tell us what is behind this?"
Tiffany looked over them both, poking and prodding into both of
Sakura\'s engorged breasts, then walking over and patting Nissa\'s
backside experimentally. Nissa cooed softly at her touch. Tiff took
notice, smiled, then backed off.\
\
"Will, I don\'t sense any spell auras on them, but I do notice something
else\..." She waved them over to the dining room table and they
followed. Nissa was barely able to wobble over, her behind jiggling ack
and forth way more than she was used to. Sakura made do, being quite
used to boobs of a larger size, the growth not being too exponential.
They both took a seat, Nissa\'s chair making an audible \'creak\' as she
sat all the way down.\
\
"Alright, what happened right before they grew?" Asked Tiffany, wanting
to get right to the point. Sakura glanced over at Nissa, who looked back
meekly, hands fidgeting under the table. Sakura nudged her head in a way
that said \'go on, tell her\'. Nissa sighed, took a deep breath and let
it all out.\
\
"I just\...I got really upset and when I get upset I eat, so I ate a
bunch yesterday and I woke up and I was huge, but\...but I was trying to
exercise and I was getting so hungry and I just\...I just\...uh\...I
ate\...and it was\...I\'m so sorry Kura I didn\'t mean to\..." All the
stress of the past two days seemed to hit Nissa like a freight train at
that moment as tears began to roll down her face. Sakura comforted her
friend, rubbing her back and sighing.\
\
"She\'s\...not the best when it comes to restraining herself\..."
Tiffany chuckled a bit at this.\
\
"She loves to live life to the fullest. Its alright dear, its
understandable." Tiffany said in a soothing voice, brushing a piece of
her crimson hair away from her glasses and back behind her ear. Nissa
nodded, drying her face and shaking it off. "But from what you\'re
telling me, its something that I feared would occur. That spell you cast
upon yourself while working at my store\...it had some nasty after
effects on you. It seems that if you eat too much\...unhealthily, I
would assume, your body will react and grow."\
\
"B-but\...it was only one piece of cake!" Tiffany scratched her head a
bit, but an idea occurred.\
\
"What did you have yesterday then?" At this Nissa fidgeted in her seat
embarrassingly. \
\
"Erm\...well\..."\
\
"Let\'s just say she cleared out about half our fridge." Nissa went red
and rubbed the back of her head abashedly. Tiffany nodded again, then
stood.\
\
"It seems that your rear is a magic battery. This is another after
effect, it seems. It is able to store and release magical energy in
seemingly random intervals. The food that you consumed\...some of it was
converted into magic energy and redirected into your booty there. So,
even though you only had a little to eat today, the eating spree from
yesterday wasn\'t finished and decided to release today\..." She looked
over at Sakura\'s bosom, still glistening with sweat from the ordeal.\
\
"And Sakura, your breasts seem also to be afflicted by this\...\'magical
battery syndrome\', I suppose. You also absorb magic energy that is
thrown at you and convert it into breast flesh." She pushed up her
glasses back up the bridge of her nose with her index finger. "So, the
reason you grew was because of Nissa here\...her body couldn\'t process
all the magical energy being produced and decided to expel it instead of
storing it. And since your breasts also absorb magic energy, they picked
it right up, since you were within a close enough space to take it in."
She concluded by taking out a notepad from her bosom as well as a pen
and jotting down notes.\
\
Mano began to round the corner into the kitchen to pick up a snack, but
as soon as she saw the red hair of Tiffany, she stopped dead in her
tracks. She then looked down, seeing her now much larger backside than
she remembered.\
\
"Holy shit, your ass got HUGE." Mano yelled out of reflex, abruptly
clamping her hands around her mouth after she said it. Tiffany stopped
her notes, then whipped around to face Mano, wobbling slightly from the
weight of her bottom.\
\
\'Still not used to that\...\' she thought, then stepped over to Mano.
She looked at her, Mano trying to put on a courageous, or bored (she
couldn\'t tell which) face, but she could tell she was pretty
intimidated. "Any more comments about my bottom dear? Would you like one
to match?" She smirked and winked, in a half-joking, half-serious
manner. Mano shook her head and left quickly, disappearing into her
room. "Now then\..." She went back over to the other ladies to finish up
her visit.\
\
"So\...Nissa: I would recommend watching your diet, and exercising. Get
your booty and you mind under control. I know you\'re smart dear, it
shouldn\'t be too hard of an issue." Nissa smiled at Tiffany\'s
compliments and nodded. "And Sakura, dear\..." She gave her a worried
look. "Just as Nissa has some\...unwarranted after effects, I fear you
may have them too. Now, whether they are the same or something entirely
different\...I cannot be sure."\
\
"Can you get us back to our smaller sizes\...?" Tiffany shook her head
and both Sakura and Nissa sulked a bit in defeat.\
\
"My magic back when I was younger was\...very erratic, as I have said.
There is no set cure for what you are under. I believe Nissa may be able
to work off her butt. However\...your breasts, dear\...aren\'t going
back down. I\'m sorry." Sakura looked down, the wide expanse of cleavage
on for display, screaming to escape their cloth prison. She nodded and
shrugged, causing her breasts to shake violently. \
\
"I\'ll deal with it, I guess." Tiffany nodded and gave her a reassuring
pat on her shoulder. She stood, going over to the door frame of the
kitchen. \
\
"Must be on my way dears. Kura, you start on the\...?"\
\
"22nd. I put in my two weeks to Danny Dee\'s three days ago." Tiffany
nodded.\
\
"Fantastic! Oh, it\'ll be SO much easier having some help over at the
store. If you ever want to drop by Nissa, feel free." Nissa nodded and
smiled as Tiffany snapped her fingers, disappearing in a cloud of smoke.
They sat there for a moment before Sakura got up, bumping her slightly
swollen bosom into the table, knocking it away a little. \
\
"Ho, ok\...none of that\..." She settled her breasts as they wobbled
this way and that until they finally came to a stop. Nissa stood as
well, being cautious not to hit the table as Sakura did. Sakura looked
her over again. "Jeez Niss\...take my breasts and stuff them down your
pants and we get your butt." She pointed out with a laugh. Nissa went a
tad pink at this remark, but couldn\'t help but laugh with her friend.
"Don\'t worry about it too hard. We\'ll be working double time to get
that thing under control. Deal?" Nissa smiled at her friends optimism.\
\
"Deal!"

CH 4: After Effects 2

Mano giggled as she tip-toed her way into the kitchen. Pulling out the
required equipment and ingredients, she began her mischievous plan. \
\
Taking the Tupperware container in hand, she began to fill it most of
the way with water. She then added the Jello mix, then the "special
ingredient" she had conjured.\
\
"Hehehe\...this should be fun to watch\..." She stirred it all in for
about ten minutes or so, then placed it in the fridge for later. About a
half hour passed until Sakura entered the kitchen, opening the
refrigerator and seeing that some Jello had mysteriously been placed
into it. \
\
"Hmm\...Niss, did you make some Jello?" She called out, but got no
response. "Niss?" She stepped out into the living room, her tight
t-shirt compressing her titanic J cups tightly together, but allowing
them to wobble just a little inside their confines. "Where did she
go\...?" She shrugged and stepped over to the kitchen, grabbing a bowl,
then headed over to the table. "I\'m sure she won\'t mind if I have
some. She\'s supposed to be on a diet anyways\..." Taking a few
spoonfuls from the container and piling it into the small glass bowl,
Sakura helped herself to the red gelatin.\
\
"Mmm! Strawberry! Delish\~" She took in a few more spoonfuls, humming a
heavenly tune. Meanwhile, Mano stood inside her room, Nissa with her,
magically bound on a chair with her motuh tied. Her booty poured over it
easily, and Mano had considered getting a second chair, but decided
against it.\
\
"Maybe this is going too far?" Mano asked the helpless Niss, who
struggled with her restraints. "Ughhh, I\'m sorry Niss, I\'ve just
really needed to vent out some of the ol\' magic energy lately! I\'m
getting bored around here. I don\'t like being bored!" She let out a
sigh in frustration. "And that Tiffany bitch breathing down my neck\...I
know I can\'t use magic these days\...grr\..." She flicked her wrist,
unbinding Nissa from the chair. She let out a gasp and stared at her for
a moment with near watering eyes.\
\
"Don\'t look at me like that. I apologized." Nissa said nothing, but
merely put up her chin and closed her eyes in a refined sort of way,
walking out of the room without giving Mano another glance. Mano looked
on, bewildered.\
\
"What\'s gotten into her?"\
\
Meanwhile, Sakura had consumed her entire bowl of Jello and was busy
washing it in the sink, humming happily. She looked over as she set the
bowl to the side to dry.\
\
"There you are! I thought it was kind of weird that you disappeared all
of a sudden. Did you make that Jello? Its amaaaaazing!" Nissa stood in
the kitchen doorway with her adorable, yet solemn eyes looking on at
Sakura. She shook her head.\
\
"Actually\...Mano made it." Sakura froze in place, her hands halting in
mid motion. "I think she may have done something to it too\..."
Sakura\'s eyebrow twitched. Her fingers slowly curled together into
petite fists. She turned abruptly to Nissa, her face going red.\
\
"Like what?!" \
\
\*plap, bulblub\*\
\
A soft noise emitted from just below Sakura. She looked down, and soon
she had her answer. Her boobs were bobbing and jiggling uncontrollably,
left and right, up and down. Her shirt could hardly contain them. It was
as if they were made of\...\
\
"JELLO TITS! AHAHAHA!" Mano laughed out loud from the kitchen doorway,
pointing at Sakura\'s now uncontrollably wobbly bosom.\
\
"Mano I\'m gonna\...woaheha!" Sakura had to grip onto her breasts to
keep from jiggling, to little avail. Ripples flowed all over them, her
shirt creaking audibly every so often. "Ugh! Change me back! I don\'t
need them this jiggly! As if they weren\'t bad enough
already\...ergh\..." They drooped slightly for a moment, only to rebound
back upwards, almost slapping her in the face. Their elasticity and
unmanageable jostling was taking Sakura by surprise every time she moved
even slightly. \
\
"Pfft, it wears off on its own, jello tits. In like an hour or so! So
get used to it! Hahaa!" She continued her endless laughs at Sakura\'s
predicament, but Sakura soon shot her a harsh glare.\
\
"Alright then\..." Sakura reached her hand into her cleavage, each
individual tit slapping back and forth all over until she managed to
grab what she was looking for. "\...I guess its time to make a call to
\'you-know-who\'\..." Mano\'s laughing stopped abruptly.\
\
"You\...you wouldn\'t\..." Mano muttered, a hint of fear in her voice.
Sakura grinned, glad that power was back under her control. She pressed
the speed dial for Tiffany.\
\
"Its ringing\..." Sakura teased with her malicious grin. Mano let out an
audible gulp, then pulled at her collar, her own juicy L cups testing
the boundaries of her mauve tank top. "Hello? Tiff-"\
\
"Alright, alright! I\'m sorry\...look, lemme make it up to you, ok?"
Mano pleaded a bit, knowing that whatever Tiffany could do would most
likely be bad. And jiggly. Very jiggly. Sakura eyed her curiously,
waiting for her to explain. "Look\...how about we go out to the
mall\...I\'ll get you a coffee or something\...whatever you want, I\'ll
pay, ok?" Sakura smirked, then nodded, knowing she just couldn\'t pass
up Mano\'s \'generosity\'.\
\
"Hey Tiff. Yeah, its Kura. Just calling to say\...can\'t WAIT to start
tomorrow. I\'m so excited\..." she trailed off as she stepped into her
bedroom. Mano let out a sigh of relief, then glanced over to Nissa. \
\
"Seriously, I am sorry about the whole \'trapping you on a chair
thing.\' Won\'t happen ok?" Nissa nodded, but still said nothing to
Mano, returning to the living room and turning on the TV.
"Well\...alright, mall day it is\...I guess\..." Mano groaned a bit,
hefting her still incredibly hefty breasts in her hands. "You two\...are
way too goddamn heavy\...I don\'t know how that blue haired boobzilla
can stay on her feet\..." She muttered as she stepped into her own room,
ready to prepare her wallet for whatever Sakura had in store\...\
\
...\
\
"So\...how long is this supposed to last again?" Sakura asked as she sat
at the table, her usual caramel mocha cappuccino in hand, her large
bosom still wobbling around in her tight blue T-shirt. Mano shrugged.\
\
"The book said it wears off after one to two hours, but I dunno, might
last a little longer than that maybe?" She sipped her own hazelnut
macchiato, shifting in the uncomfortable metal backed chair. The mall
was bustling today. It was mid-afternoon on a weekend, so naturally,
more people were going to be there.\
\
"I need to get some tops while we\'re here by the way." Sakura noted as
she delicately sipped her coffee, a smile indicated she had just entered
café heaven. "Ooh, they always know how to make it here\~" Sakura mused,
taking another careful, yet generous sip. "I\'d say thank you Mano,
but\...well\...you know\..." She gestured to her breasts, which were
still subtly jiggling about. Their movement seemed to be unending, not
held by the laws of nature.\
\
"Yeah, yeah, whatever. Look, I was bored, ok? I get\...rambunctious when
I\'m bored\..." She muttered the last part of the sentence. Sakura
cocked her eyebrow.\
\
"\'Rambunctious\'? Really? THAT\'S the word you\'re gonna use?" Sakura
giggled as she continued to sip her coffee, bringing a hand down in a
futile attempt to steady her still shaking bosom. "Seriously, why can\'t
you just find other spells to use? Like, why don\'t you try perfecting
the transportation magic, or the fire magic? You know, something
practical? You spend all your time blowing up Nissa and I\'s bodies, I
swear, you just wanna be like Tiffany-"\
\
"Don\'t compare me to that bitch!" Mano said, a bit too loudly. Sakura
was shocked at Mano\'s sudden flash of anger, but it evolved into a smug
grin.\
\
"Oh? You jealous of Tiffany, Mano?" Sakura asked with a snicker. Mano\'s
pale face went a slight shade of pink.\
\
"N-no! Why the fuck do you think that? All that bitch has done is give
me giant heavy tits and fuck around with me-"\
\
"That\'s exactly what you do to me and Niss!"\
\
"Well yeah, but it was never PERMANENT. It was always just for fun. Look
at you and me now! Hell, look at Niss! Ever since we\'ve met that bitch
we\'ve been growing every week!" Sakura rolled her eyes.\
\
"I think you\'re exaggerating, Mano."\
\
"I liked my boobs the way they were: Nice, manageable D cups. I could
wear the shirts I wanted, bras were easy to find and put on, I could see
my feet, tie my shoes, bend over\...can\'t do any of that now. All
because of that bitch Tiffany. And look at you! You\'re fucking HUGE
now, and you were already big to begin with!" Sakura looked down at her
momentous cleavage, plunging down her collar at least half a foot down.\
\
"Yeah\...I know\...but\..."\
\
"Hell, look at Niss! Her ass is gigantic now! She can barely get through
doorways! I didn\'t have anything to do with that, now did I? No, no I
didn\'t. It was Tiffany." Sakura remained silent, but still sipped her
coffee. "Is this bitch really your friend, Sakura? Is she really looking
out for you? Think about it." \
\
"Keep it down, ok?" Sakura looked around, seeing several pairs of eyes
on them, but knowing that most likely these people were less interested
on the conversation and more on Sakura\'s never-ending wiggle boobs.
"Look, Tiffany didn\'t make us grow, ok? I did. It was an accident.
Tiffany has never done any of it on purpose. I did it and I still feel
like shit about it, especially what I did to Niss. So can you please
stop?" Mano scoffed a bit, but said nothing, sipping her coffee. They
sat in silence for a while until they were both done with their
beverages.\
\
"Alright, now, we need to go to Janelle\'s Closet so I can get some
top-" Sakura paused mid-sentence and grabbed her bosom. Its wiggle was
still going, but that\'s not what surprised her. "Urgh\...what the
hell\..." Mano looked over, walking back from throwing away their cups
in a nearby trash can.\
\
"Damn kids running everywhere\...seriously, what kind of parents let
that sort of shit happen-" She took one look at Sakura\'s strained
expression and knew something was up. "Hey, woah, what\'s going on?" She
went over to her friend and observed, her wiggling boobs still putting
her bra to the test. \
\
"I dunno\...my boobs feel\...really weird all of a sudden\...GAH!"
Suddenly, Sakura\'s breasts pushed outwards. In one big push of flesh,
her breasts expanded in all directions, filling her shirt and puffing
slightly out of her collar. They must have grown by at least one whole
inch in a second or less. Sakura was frozen in place, looking down at
her now larger wobbly bosom. She then shot a glare over at Mano. "Are
you serious right now? Why do you always-"\
\
"Hey, don\'t look at me!" Mano raised her hands and waved them in front
of herself in defense. "All I did was the Jello boobs. The instructions
didn\'t say anything about growing. And I\'m pretty sure Tiffany
would\'ve done something about it if I had cast one of her spells,
don\'t you think?" Sakura gasped again and held onto her breasts as they
quaked restlessly in her hands.\
\
"True\...I guess\...OOF!" Another surge of growth struck her as her
breasts pushed outwards another inch, the muffin effect becoming
painfully clear over the low collar of her shirt. Her shirt was starting
to ride up, revealing a small sliver of her slim belly. "Ok, I think we
need to go." Sakura said quickly, gathering up her things and grabbing
Mano by the arm, rushing to the exit. All the while she felt something
filling into her breasts. They were getting warmer and warmer every
second, and along with the exaggerated wobble that shook them about, she
also felt a slight sloshing sensation inside her mams. It grew more and
more noticeable with every step she took. She focused all her energy on
the exit as she quick stepped her way to the exit.\
\
Soon her bra creaked and groaned in protest.\
\
"Shit\...Mano, they\'re getting too big\..." Sakura muttered into
Mano\'s ear as they tried to remain as calm as possible in public. They
already got plenty of men\'s eyes to follow them as they continued their
hurried march to the outside, as well as a few women\'s. \
\
"\'Getting\'?" Mano asked semi-jokingly, in which Sakura replied with an
elbow to the rib. Mano rubbed it slightly, her own boobs quite heavy and
starting to hurt her back. "Ugh\...Kura, can we take a rest for a
second\...my back is killing me cuz of these things\..." She groaned.
Sakura sighed and looked back at her friend. Just as she did, another
inch piled onto her melons, now as big as volleyballs. \
\
"Oh God\...my bra\..." She mumbled as her bra was holding on just barely
by its clasp, its under wire digging into the soft, supple flesh of
Sakura\'s bosom. All it took was a few more seconds, Mano and Sakura
standing near a rest area, for Sakura\'s bra to make a soft "thwip", a
sound of giving up. Her breasts lurched forward, and as they did, they
wobbled out of control, smacking against her ribs and back up to her
chin. Sakura whimpered in response, but looked back up at Mano
desperately. Mano was glaring over at an old man sitting on one of the
chairs in the waiting area, his eyes glued on Sakura\'s predicament.\
\
"Would you mind?" Mano snapped her fingers, turning the lenses of the
old man\'s glasses from clear to black. The man jumped, and tried to
remove them, but to no avail.\
\
"Mano\..." Sakura mumbled, still weary as her breasts sloshed and
jiggled about relentlessly.\
\
"Hey, he was being a perv, ok? I\'m just looking out for yo-" She looked
back over and dropped her jaw in shock. "Ho\...holy shit Sakura\..."
Sakura\'s breasts had blown up to basketball size, and her nipples had
slowly puffed outwards, getting completely erect. They pointed through
her impossibly tight shirt, their forms clearly defined; it was as if
she wasn\'t even wearing a shirt.\
\
"Mano\...we need to go\..." Sakura grabbed Mano once again and rushed
into a nearby clothing shop. They rushed past the clerk and into a
dressing room, its small space not meant for two people, especially not
with the exaggerated physiques that Mano and Kura possessed.\
\
Sakura and Mano smashed together, their breasts squished up against one
another tightly. \
\
"What\...kind of plan was this, Kura?" Sakura moaned as her breasts
continued to fill with warmth and liquid.\
\
"Look, I panicked, can you blame me right now\...unnnhh\..." The
pressure was mounting, Kura could feel it. Her boobs were getting taut
and her nipples were at their maximum erectness. The sloshing in her
breasts was pushing further and further to the front of her breasts.
"We\...might have a problem Mano\..." She was moaning now,
uncontrollably, as her breasts suddenly got another boost in growth, but
it brought something else with it\...\
\
"What do you meaAAHH!" Mano yelped, but held her hand over her mouth as
Kura\'s breasts suddenly shot out milk from her nipples. Her shirt was
automatically soaked at the nips, and it flowed further down to dampen
the rest of the lower portion of the t-shirt. \
\
"Oh Goooood\...." Sakura moaned as her nipples continued to shoot out
milk in pulses. She gripped onto Mano\'s breasts as it happened, not
conscious of what she was gripping.\
\
"Woah, hey, watch what you\'re holding onto Kura\...mmmph\..." Mano
tried to hold back her own pleasurable moans, Sakura\'s touch stirring
something inside of her that she wasn\'t prepared for. They squirmed
within their small confines, Sakura grinding her wide hips and ass
against the stall of the fitting room. Slowly, but surely, her nipples
stopped exuding milk, their size slightly smaller than before. \
\
"Oh\...my\..." Sakura gasped out, catching her breath from the orgasm
that she had just experienced. "Wasn\'t expecting that\..."\
\
"Well, at least its done, I guess\..." Mano reached for the door and
opened the lock, wiping her hands off on her legs to dry them. "Got milk
all over me\..." she she muttered as she walked out. Sakura followed
close behind, her volleyball breasts still jiggling and jostling in her
soaked t-shirt. "Should we uh\...buy a jacket or something to cover
those?" Sakura shook her head.\
\
"Let\'s just\...go home\...please\..." She took a step forward, but as
she did, her breasts surprisingly pushed out once again.
"They\'re\...they\'re not done yet?" Sakura said with worry in her
voice. She groaned as she felt the warmth begin to build inside her once
again. "Oh shit\...Mano, we need to get back\...fast!" Mano nodded and
grabbed Sakura by the wrist as they rushed out of the shop. \
\
Every hurried step that they traveled sent Sakura\'s inflating chest
into a shaking spree. She could feel her knockers pushing out at a more
constant rate now, filled with more and more milk. They weaved and
dodged around people, ignoring the looks that they received, knowing the
direness of the situation. Mano began to tire. Her L cup bowling
volleyball sized boobs were weighing her down until all she could manage
was a trudge. They stepped to another waiting section, and luckily there
was no one there this time.\
\
"C\'mon Mano\...we need to hurry\..." Sakura said between breaths,
pulling her shirt down slightly as it was now just barely covering her
gigantic flesh orbs. They still hung out a good centimeter or so. "I
can\'t\...take much more of this\..."\
\
"Why don\'t you\...call Tiffany or something?" Mano asked breathlessly.
Sakura stood there blankly for a moment, then sighed.\
\
"Duh\..." She reached into her endless sea of cleavage and fished out
her phone. Unfortunately, the activity seemed to speed up the growth
process, and her nipples were hard once more. "Oh no\...round
two\...gotta hurry\..." She began dialing Tiffany\'s number as fast as
she could manage, and held it to her ear, listening to the ring.
Eventually, she picked up.\
\
"Hello?" Tiffany asked.\
\
"Tiff! Its Sakura! I need your help\...my boobs are\...unnnHHH" She
dropped to her knees as her breasts began to wobble and slosh. Her skin
was tight again and her nipples were nearly tearing holes through her
tight t-shirt. "No\...not here\...please\..." She could feel all the
milk splashing in her over-inflated bazooms, and soon it was getting so
full that all it could do was go towards her nipples. It was as if her
breasts were cannons and they were getting ready to fire. Everything
went black for Sakura. All she could feel were her breasts readying for
a heavy spray. It felt more intense than the first time.\
\
"Ohh\...ohhhhh\..." Sakura moaned as an orgasm built up inside her. Her
hands traveled south, but she managed to pull them back to her hips to
prevent further embarassment. She clung on hard to her soft, plush hips
as the feeling reached its climax"\
\
"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!" Sakura screamed in ecstasy as her breasts sprayed
milk forcibly from her puffy nipples. Streams shot out of her shirt and
soaked her all the way down. Her shirt was barely covering her chest at
this point, her breasts as large as medicine balls -- and still growing.
She could see them, they were still getting bigger, and so much faster
than before. Centimeters at a time, then inches, to beach ball size, and
even bigger than that.\
\
"Oh my God\...why\...no\...noooo\..." She muttered as she collapsed onto
them. She could feel herself being jostled around as her nipples sprayed
gallon after gallon of milk in front of her, pouring onto the floor and
creating quite the puddle. She kept growing\...and growing\...it seemed
to be endless\...\
\
\"Büyüme defolun, boyutu mühür!"\
\
Sakura heard strange words as symbols surrounded her. It was then that
she noticed she wasn\'t in the mall anymore. She was in Tiffany\'s shop,
lying on a rounded surface. Small walls surrounded her, like a kiddie
pool, and they contained all the milk that her boobs were exerting. It
almost filled the whole pool. \
\
"Ti\...Tiffany?" Sakura muttered as she looked up, seeing the dark
crimson hair of Tiffany next to the lighter shade of red hair that was
Mano. Mano sat in a chair nearby, her boobs resting on her lap as she
leaned towards Sakura. \
\
"She gonna be ok?" Mano asked, looking over at Tiffany. Tiffany nodded.\
\
"Yes, she\'ll be fine. Most of that will go away too, it just needs to
drain. Some will stick around, but not too much, maybe like\...an inch?"
Tiffany stepped over and muttered a few more magic words as Sakura\'s
breasts began to shrink back down to old measurements. \
\
"Thank\...you\..." Sakura muttered before passing out, completely spent
from her ordeal.\
\
"Jeez, that must\'ve been worse than it looked." Mano remarked. \
\
"Yeah, well, lactation curses can be incredibly intense. More intense
than growth curses, I can tell you that." Mano nodded, not entirely sure
what to make of her statement.\
\
"So\...why did this happen?" Tiffany observed Sakura as she shrunk back
down to K cups, now as big as bowling balls. Her shirt was torn in
several places, especially around the nipples somehow, and seemed to be
a bit looser now, obviously stretched out from its experience.\
\
"What were you two doing before this occurred?" Mano thought, wanting to
elave the jello prank out of her explanation.\
\
"Well, we went to the mall, had some coffee, then I came back from
throwing some stuff away and\..." She held her hands away from her own
chest to emphasize. "\...bwoomph". \
\
"Hmmm\..." Tiffany pndered the information for a moment. "Aha!" her eyes
lit up with realization. "Was there any milk in Sakura\'s drink?" Mano
thought back to the order. \
\
"Er\...I think so?" \
\
"What kind of milk, specifically?"\
\
"I think they use whole milk at that place\...I remember asking one of
the baristas before\..."\
\
"Ah, that makes sense\..." Tiffany stepped over to a book and opened it,
reading through, then put it back, stepping back over to Mano and
Sakura. "The curse she afflicted upon herself a little while back seems
to have some after effects as well, just like Nissa\'s. It seems that if
she drinks any milk, whole milk in particular, then she\...well\..." She
pointed towards Sakura\'s wet, shiny chest. It seemed to have stopped
jiggling, for the first time all day. "\...does that." Mano nodded.\
\
"You want me to tell her that when she wakes up\...or\...?" Tiffany
shook her head, removing her glasses and bringing her hands to her face
in exhaustion.\
\
"No, I can tell her" She said, her words a bit muffled through her
hands. She brought them back down and put her glasses back on. "She
won\'t be happy about it\...but it could\'ve been worse. At least there
was a way to reverse it. She still needs to be careful though\...I
don\'t know how many times the reversal will actually work."\
\
Sakura merely slept peacefully on the floor, her back resting against
the pool of milk. Blissfully unaware of the changes that had been made
to her body while she had slept.\
\
"I need to find a permanent cure for them\..." Tiffany said as she
walked up some stairs to another section of the stores. "\...if I can. I
really hope I can. Keep an eye on her, ok?" She called down as she began
her preparations for study.\
\
"Got it!" Mano called back as Tiffany walked out of earshot. Mano merely
stared at Sakura as she slept for a moment, her chest heaving up and
down in peaceful slumber. She looked around until she found a long, thin
rod made of bamboo and began prodding Sakura\'s wet rack. \
\
"Mrfrrr\..." Sakura muttered and wiggled around. Mano giggled and
continued to poke her friend until she stirred out of sleep in
annoyance. "Ugh! Stop\...poking\...mah boobs!" She stretched a bit,
feeling her breasts slosh around a little, still containing just a
little bit of milk. "Oof\...hey\...are they\...bigger than before\...?"
Sakura asked, her heart sinking a little. Mano snickered.\
\
"Well, uh\...lemme explain\..."\

CH 5: Dreams and Nightmares

SAKURA\'S MILKY NIGHTMARE\
\
The sun began to set on the quiet farmland. As the calm laid across it,
a blue haired vixen made her way across the field. Dressed in a tight,
crop-top button up shirt that showed off her bountiful cleavage. Three
ribbons were pinned to the front of her bulging chest, showing off her
dancing accomplishments, of which she was just coming home from.?\
\
\"I cant believe I beat out April in the dance off, she is the
Champion!\" Sakura cheered, causing her compressed swell of sweater meat
to jiggle with excitement. The top most button creaked just slight with
her bouncy actions.\
\
It was the annual Country Fair. Hosted events included Animal
competitions, dancing, singing, tons of food, and countless other
events. Some of the more family friendly venues were already closing for
the evening, while others opened up. The bars opened their doors for the
crowds to party the night away as they hosted not only alcohol but other
events that involve pairing.\
\
Sakura crossed the top of the hill as she looked over at the fields.
Lights and tiki torches were being lit up as the sun fell. Cicadas were
starting to quiet down for dusk.\
\
\"I need to hurry up, Lucy doesn\'t like to be alone for so long!\"
Sakura quickened her pace as comfortably as her bouncing bosom would
allow. Her ribbons flipped and flailed from the repeated up and down
motions. She could already here worried moos from the animal stable
ahead as she passed the folks closing the animal rides.\
\
Sakura stepped up to the fence that separated her from her beloved cow,
Lucy. \
\
\"There you are girl\...I\'m here!\" Sakura beamed over at her, and the
cow almost seemed to moo in delight in sight of her owner. Over the
years, Sakura and Lucy had developed a very special bond between one
another, that could be likened to a man and his dog. She unhooked the
latch of the gate and swung it open, making sure to close it behind her
tight, even if she didn\'t have to worry about Lucy making a break for
it.\
\
While it wasn\'t exactly a pleasant smell, the smell of Lucy\'s stable
was incredibly nostalgic for Sakura. The smell of hay mixed with manure,
while to some may seem disgusting or intolerable, was something that
Sakura didn\'t mind whatsoever, and only made her feel more at home with
her cow.\
\
\"Shh\...its alright, dear\...\" Sakura brushed her cow with her hand
soothingly, feeling the soft hide of the bovine at her fingertips.
\"Mommy\'s here\...\"?\
\
Lucy swung her huge head to Sakura and licked the girl\'s face\
\
\"Ohohoho I missed you too, little Miss First Place cow \* Sakura rubbed
her bovine\'s hears. Around her neck hung a very large blue ribbon with
golden letters that read \"1st Place Cow\"\
\
\"And I got some winnings thanks to Moo\" Sakura chuckled and she dipped
her hands into the creamy plush canyon of her cleavage, laughing at her
cow joke. She took a few moments, as if she was really having a hard
time searching. She then pulled out a warmed stack of money and
grinned.\
\
\"We got a lot of cash here, Girl. I can afford to fix yup you ban back
at home!\"\
\
Lucy mooed back to her owner for more ear rubs.?\
\
\"For now though, we rest and celebrate\...\" Taking the money and
setting it aside, Sakura leaned back on a haystack for a moment, still a
bit tired from the walk back home. After a few moments of rest, stroking
Lucy\'s warm side, Sakura sat up going over to a metal locker she kept
just outside the stable. \
\
Entering in the combination, she pulled open the door, but clumsily
knocked it shut with her large bosom. \
\
\"Whoops! I forgot these things can get in the way sometimes!\" Sakura
let out a giggle and opened the door again. Inside were all sorts of
items especially for Lucy: a brush, a spray bottle, a couple tins, and
some of her favorite wheat, specially designed for cows in mind. She
grabbed the brush as well as some of the wheat and stepped back over to
Lucy.\
\
\"Alright, girl, its din-din time.\" Giving Lucy a broad smile, Sakura
offered her the wheat, which she began munching on happily?\
\
Sakura giggled as Lucy dug into the handful of wheat in her hand. The
cow\'s snorts shot the loose grain in all directions.\
\
\"Easy girl, no one will take it away from you. Sometimes I think you a
black and white pig!\"\
\
Sakura brushed her hands and boobs off, scooping out a copious amount of
spare wheat from her cleavage. Sakura paused for a moment as she put
what she could in the bag and held up a small pinch of the cow chow.
Having never tried it out, she slowly placed some of if in her mouth and
gave a chew.\
\
\"Meeeeh\....not really tasty\....but it could be worse!\" Sakura
chirped as she shut the container on her hand with her voluminous chest
\"Ouch!\"?\
\
Lucy mooed in an upset manner, to which Sakura replied with a laugh.\
\
\"Oh, I\'m fine dear, don\'t worry about me.\" For a while Sakura just
laid there next to her, brushing and grooming her, making sure she drank
her water, until a loud sound of an engine came from the distance.
Sakura stood and went to the edge of the stable.\
\
\"Hey Sakura!\" A young man yelled out from the driver\'s side window of
a large, brown, beaten up pick-up truck. Sakura smiled and waved back.\
\
\"Hey Tommy! What\'s going on?\" \
\
\"Some of the boys were gonna drive up to The Bull for some drinks. Did
you wanna join?\" Sakura looked back at Lucy, then turned back and
nodded.\
\
\"Sure. Let me just finish up here and I\'ll be right there.\"?\
\
Sakura brushed the hay off her round bottom and the rest of herself. \
\
\"I'm going to go into town for a bit, then ill come back and we can go
home mkay?\"\
\
\"Mooooooooooooooooooo\" Lucy shook her head a bit and went back to
feeding.\
\
Sakura locked the pen back up and bounced her way over to Tommy\'s old
beater. After a short fifteen minute drive, they arrived at the bar.\
\
\"Alright, we\'re here.\" Tommy announced as he unlocked his door and
removed his seatbelt. \
\
\"You said your friends are gonna be here?\" Tommy nodded as he pulled
his keys out of the ignition. \
\
\"Yep, they should already be inside.\" He leaned to get out, but Sakura
stopped him.\
\
\"Wait\...Tommy\...you got a little something\...\" Sakura quickly
leaned in on him, but slowed down as she neared his face.\
\
\"Uh\...hwha\...\" Tommy was frozen as Sakura got closer and closer to
him by the second. He could feel her warm breath on his face, and her
bust was beginning to press against his own chest\...?\
\
\"Yoink!\" Sakura giggled as she stole his keys and popped out the other
side of the truck.\
\
\"H-hey!\" He clambered out of his truck and gave chase.\
\
Much to his surprise, Sakura was very nimble for her body type. Tommy
grabbed his hat as he tried to speed up, only to slip at the tailgate of
his truck.\
\
\"C\'MON BULL RIDER!! CATCH MEEEEEE\" She cat called back at him as she
zipped around the front.\
\
Tommy quickly reversed to catch the curvy culprit. He swung around the
front and locked eyes with her as she came around. With agility not seen
ever, Sakura leaped onto the hood of the truck and slid on her tush
passed her pursuer and continued her escape\
\
\"What the hell!?\" He slid to a halt. Returning to the back he found
her sitting on top of the cab with her legs crossed.\
\
\"What shall I do\...\" She mused. \"I could throw them\.....\" She
pretended to hold her arm up in for a large toss. \"Or drop them\" She
smiled as she held the keys over her rising and falling bust as she
breathed hard, giving a small giggle as she watched his expression,
jingling the keys.?\
\
\"Yeah\...let\'s go with that one\...\"  Tommy could only stare as
Sakura dragged the keys across her chest seductively, making light marks
across her skin. She smirked as she dropped them on her chest, letting
her boobs wobble slightly in response, then lifted them back up. She
dropped them again, left them, then pumped her chest up and down,
watching them bounce up and down on her springy orbs. Each jiggle sent
the keys flying about, going forwards and back until they finally landed
dead center on her cleavage.\
\
Slowly and teasingly, Sakura pushed the cold pair of keys down her two
creamy orbs. She shivered a bit at the touch of them, continuing to
shove them further down. Tommy just watched, mesmerized as Sakura kept
her eyes right on him, smiling seductively. \"You want em back, bull
rider?\" \
\
Tommy merely responded with a nod, and a dry \*gulp\*. With a flip of
her legs, Sakura, leaned over the side of the truck and hopped down,
landing with a soft \"thud\", her bust wobbling and making a light
\'jingle\' noise. \
\
\"Then come get \'em.\" She began her saunter into the bar, giggling
slightly as she pushed open the doors.\
\
The Bar was ablaze with loud voices and laughter. People all huddles
into clusters of friendly groups.\
\
Sakura sashayed in with her sexiest walk. She emphasized the sideways
sway of her breasts, making she to jingle her stolen goods as she
smiled. Tommy was right on her heels, able to hear the cry of his
trapped keys\
\
\"BARTENDER!! SARSPIRILLA!!! Sakura called, laying her jugs on the bar
table.\
\
Tommy took a seat next to her, eying her bust. Sakura simply smiled at
him.?\
\
The bartender eyed Sakura for a moment, then gave her a grunt.\
\
\"Coming right up, madam.\" He somehow seemed to take no interest in
Sakura\'s chest, but it was mostly because he had seen her a few times
before. Being a married man, he couldn\'t risk the incident he suffered
last time Sakura came in. His wife still wouldn\'t let him hear the end
of it\...\
\
"One sarsaparilla, for the lovely young lady\" the bartender set the
drink down next to Sakura. She looked over at it with a smile and
thanked the bartender for his service. Picking it up, she brought it to
her lips and took a sip. As she set it out, she had a funny idea.\
\
Lowering the drink to her chest, Sakura decided to twist the glass down
into her cleavage, sealing it tight between her bosom.\
\
\"Man, these things are all KINDS of useful, aren\'t they?\" Sakura
taunted Tommy with a giggle. Suddenly, Sakura stood, pulling the glass
from her jugs as she felt them suddenly tingle out of nowhere.
"Uhh..nnng\...I\'ll be right back Tommy, I gotta\...freshen up a
bit\..." Tommy raised his hand in protest, but lowered it as Sakura
stumbled away. \
\
"Hope she doesn\'t take off\...she still has my keys\..." Tommy shook
his head and downed the Sasparilla in a few gulps.\
\
\"Gosh\...what\'s going on\...why do these feel so\...weird all of a
sudden?\" Sakura stumbled her way uneasily over to the restroom near the
entrance of the bar, almost tumbling her way in before shutting and
locking the door behind her. The room was small, dank, and smelled
horrid. She tried to press all of that out of her mind and focus on the
issue at hand: her breasts. She brought a tentative hand up to her left
boob, both her nips standing at full attention through her white
t-shirt.\
\
\"O-oh my, what\'s got you girls all up in a fuss?\" wincing as she
cupped her throbbing bust. As she stood in the glum restroom she looked
on at her boobs. She could feel a slight sensation building up in them,
but wasn\'t sure what it was nor was she overly concerned with it at the
present moment.\
\
\"Calm down now\...Thomas isn\'t a STUD or anything\....\"\
\
\"I mean\...maybe I thought about it once or twice, but its\...its
nothing to\...nothing to get\...unh\...\" Her cheeks begin to get
flushed. She begins to pant, her chest heaving up and down. Hands
gripping onto the sink for balance as the world starts spinning and she
grows dizzy. The sensation in her chest grows and grows, a pressure
building up inside of her. It pushed further and further forward,
begging to be released.\
\
\"What is\...happening\...to me\...?\"\
\
As if to answer her, wet spots began to form on her top. Sakura didn\'t
quite notice it at first until they grew larger and touches more of her
skin\
\
Sakura jumped in surprise.\
\
\"W-whats that!? My tops is all wet now\...\" as she brought her hands
up to feel her front. She was instantly rewarded with an intense
pleasing feeling as she compressed her nips. She felt liquid filling in
her hands.\
\
\"AHHH!\" Her hands whip back from her breasts, but it was too late. A
stream of creamy white liquid began streaming through her shirt,
splashing across the mirror and dripping down onto the sink. \"What
is\...I\'m lactating?!\" She shakes her head in disbelief, paralyzed in
shock as her breasts continue to pour out, the stream intensifying.\
\
But that wasn\'t all. It was jus then that Sakura noticed that her shirt
felt\...tighter.\
\
\"Oh god my shirt its so tight suddenl- A-am I\....Growing too!?\"
Shouting in shock as she can hear and feel the fabric slowly moving over
her gushing bust. She felt the damp hem pulled up higher over her tight
tum. Slack was starting to pull under her arms and form straight, guitar
like ripples.\
\
\"I\...I am! I\'m getting\...bigger!\" Astounded by this revelation,
thinking she couldn\'t ever get any bigger than her already tremendous
bust, Sakura stares dumbfounded as her shirt continues to draw upwards,
her collar plunging to reveal more and more cleavage. The hems around
her shoulders tighten as she hears small pops and tears emanating from
her shirt. \"Oh my God\...I need to get out of here\...!\"\
\
Sakura burst out of the bathroom, her breasts wobbling frantically in
her shrinking shirt as she kept spraying. She planned to simply dart out
the door, but the sight of the bar made her pause and steady her
lactating bosom. The bar was dead silent. Everyone was gathered in a
large group. Pitchforks, torches, and various other tools hovered over
the cowboy hats while the group murmured in hushed tones.\
\
Suddenly Thomas popped up on the bar. His eyes were glowing red. He
pointed to Sakura.\
\
\"LOOKS LIKE WE GOT OURSELVES HERE A NEW COW, I RECKON!!!!\"\
\
At first, there was silence. Sakura stared back at the mob, and they
stared back, a longing desire for milk in their eyes. She felt her heart
sink far into the pits of her gut, until it hit the bottom hard. She
turned on her heel and began to run. As she ran, she noticed two things:
the angry yells of the lustful crowd behind her, and her jugs, which
swayed mercilessly to the side, up and down, spraying all around her as
they reached the size of medicine balls.\
\
\"UGH! Just stop growing already!\" She tries holding them with her
hands as she runs, but to no avail. It only forces more milk out of her,
as well as pleasure, nearly making her fall over. She releases her hands
immediately, and continues her frantic sprint from the mob behind her.\
\
\"MILK! MILK! MILK! MILK! MILK!\" The mob of red eyes cowboys and
farmhands chant as they give chase. Sakura gracelessly  fumbles in her
panicked run as her breasts continue to both grow and spray garden hose
amounts of milk all over.\
\
\"LEAVE ME ALONE!!!\" She cried as she slid around the corner of the
buildings into the back parking lot.\
\
The parking lot sat adjacent to the largest cornfield around. Sakura
took a moment to gather herself up a she doused the ground in front of
her.\
\
The mob rounded the corner and slowed to a confusion. The new cow was
nowhere to be seen\
\
\"WAIT!\" shouted one of the farmers, pointing his torch to the ground.
Large twin puddles of milk lead to each car before leading off into the
corn field\
\
\"SHES IN THE FIELD!! SURROUND IT!!\"\
\
The red eyes split off into multiple groups. Some taking a position
along the perimeter of the field, others diving in.\
\
A few yards away, Sakura poked her head out from behind one of the
buildings. Realizing her whereabouts were unknown, she released her nips
and almost screamed as a stronger torrent of milk sprayed out of her\
\
\"I can\'t hold it like that again\" She whimpered as she sloshed up to
the last truck she hadn\'t tried to take.\
\
Panting, but slightly relieved, Sakura took a moment to collect herself,
which was difficult considering her breasts were still pumping out milk,
and puffing out inches. By now they had crawled down to her navel, and
still had not stopped.\
\
\"Gotta\...hide\...quick\...\" Spotting Tommy\'s truck, Sakura heaved
her way over to it, keeping her moans low as to not be spotted.
\"Ok\...keys\...unh\...\" Looking down into her cleavage, her shirt
barely able to contain her milky wonders, she knew what she had to do.
With the ends of her breasts bulging from the bottom of her shirt, she
hoped that her keys had remained inside.\
\
\"Well\...h-h-here goes nothing\...\"\
\
Sakura jammed her hand into the tight line of her cleavage. She
instantly froze and gasped, almost crying out in pleasure as the inner
walls of her cleavage sparked so wonderfully she almost sank to her
legs.\
\
\"Haaah\...Haaaah\...Haaaah\....g-gotta\....find them!\" she shut her
mouth and made little noises as she searched her cleavage for the keys
to his car, pausing to gasp for air as she unintentionally held her
breathe to prevent screaming. Her breasts were tightening their grip on
her arm, making it harder and more pleasureful to bumble about inside
her cavernous yet cramped cleavage.\
\
Twisting and turning her arm as her bosom squeezed it, she finally felt
the warm edges of metal that was the key she was so desperately hunting
for. \"Oooh\...th-there you are\...\" Delicately wrapping  finger around
the key chain, she began to pull it upwards, dragging it along her bust
slowly and gradually, her boobs now kept incredibly tight together due
to the confines of her almost destroyed t-shirt. The key sent even more
pleasure pops coursing throughout her tits, then her whole body, Sakura
needing to lean against the car slightly with her free hand to stay
upright. Finally, with a light, wet \'pop\', the key was free.\
\
\"\"G-gotcha!\"\
\
Her torrents of milk soaked the door as she accidentally rammed the full
brunt of her oversized medicine ball bosom into it. She nearly bounced
off completely had it not been for the heavy sloshing milk still in her
boobs. She bent forward to see the key slot, shaking as her boobs pulsed
in ecstasy form the constant pumping.\
\
She yanked the door open and instantly soaked the seats of the truck.\
\
\"C-cant worry about\....wet seats\.....OOooooooh S-stop it you two!\"
She hushed at her leaking boobs as she eyed the glowing of torches in
the field.\
\
Sakura gently forced her leaking bosom into the cab before she tried to
enter herself, swinging left so she faced the front.\
\
She sat there for several minutes, her breasts relentlessly spewing milk
and inflating more and more in pulses, crawling downwards until the
rested on her lap. Puddles of milk started to accumulate upon the floor
of the truck, and was seeping out onto the ground underneath it. Sakura
could only stand there and watch, hoping no one would find her. \
\
\"Why did this happen\...why am I a\...a\...\" Tears welled up in her
eyes as she lightly tapped her throbbing bosom. \"A dairy cow?\" Her
breasts suddenly jostled and groaned. \"OOOhhh\...what is that\...what
is going on? HNNNGHHH!\" As her breasts began to throb hard and pleasure
coursed through her veins, an image popped into her head: her visit to
her beloved cow in her barn. Her eating her food. It all made sense.
\"NO way\...no way could that do this to MEEEE!\" It started, and hit
her like a freight train\
\
Her milk torrents weakened to small arcing dribbles. her growth picked
up tremendously, visibly puffing up in tune with her heartbeat. She
puffed up more and more, her breasts pressing into the wheel, and soon
over it. They rose higher an higher, her view getting blocked by the
second.\
\
\"UUUUUUUNG I-IM GONNA BE TRAPPED!!!\"\
\
Just as she said it, she heard a cry, seemingly in the distance, but
closer than she anticipated.\
\
\"WAIT I THINK I SEE HER! IN THE TRUCK! THERE\'S THE COW!\" A roar of
voices follow suit. Sakura cannot confirm what she hears, her breasts
had grown so huge that they hid the front window from view. She can see
the side view mirror however; and from there she could see people
approaching her from behind the truck.\
\
\"Oh shit!\" She tries to move, but to no avail. Her tits had
effectively wedged her into the truck between the seat and the steering
wheel. She felt her back press more and more into the leather cushion of
the car seat as her breasts muffined over the uncomfortable plastic
wheel, pressing into the cold glass, which only irritated her nips even
more.\
\
The horn blared loudly as her piling breast meat sank into the steering
wheel. On cue, her boobs shuddered visibly, she gasped as a rush
happened in them, and they suddenly began to make even more milk.\
\
So strong that the entire windshield was blown out of the frame. two
white, fire hose worth jets of milk shot over a hundred feet over the
buildings. Her bosom pulsed harshly and visibly as the growth seemed to
stop. She couldn\'t see anymore as her face was full of her own boobs
pushing back. all she could do was moo.\
\
\"MOO!?\"\
\
The mob had silenced to watch as the scene played out. Outwards her milk
arced across the parking lot and into the field. \
\
\"That\'s incredible\...this woman is gonna be the greatest cow we\'ve
ever had on the farm!\" Thomas walked over and wrenched the door open,
patting Kura\'s bosom. \"Its gon\' be ok, miss Mizumi. We\'ll take good
care of you!\" Sakura wanted to shake her head in protest, but she
couldn\'t move it whatsoever.\
\
\"Moo! Mooo! MOOO!\" She wanted to yell to him \'no! You can\'t!
Please!\" but all she could do was moo.\
\
Thomas grinned. \"Quick, lets pry her out and set her up in a nice comfy
barn. Jim, get those industrial pumps you just bought. Jessie, bring the
flat bed truck\"\
\
Sakura kept mooing in protest, wriggling as best she could under the
push of her yoga ball sized breasts in the confinement of the truck.\
All Sakura could hear was the murmurings of the crowd, and the beepings
of the flat bed as it backed towards her titanic teats. She saw nothing
but her dark cleavage. She pounded on her cleavage in futility and
wailed her moos\...things went dark\...\
\
\"Ahh!\" Sakura bolted upright in her bed, caked in sweat.\
\
The dim lit roomed welcomed her eyes. Only the stark red numbers of the
digital clock next to her provided illumination.\
\
3:12.\
\
Sakura grabbed her more than head sized breasts in her tight night
shirt. They weren\'t pulsing. They weren\'t leaking. They weren\'t
growing. They sat in her grasp, spilling between her fingers as their
weight overcame what little surface area her hands provided.\
\
\"Whew\...good\...ok\...good\...\" Sitting there, the thought of the
dream still stuck in her head. Huge, yoga ball tits shooting milk at
harsh velocities across the sky\...it felt so real\...\
\
Sakura shook her head. \"Don\'t be silly Sakura\...\" She laid back
down, putting herself on her side, adjusting her boobs so they didn\'t
muffin into her face. \"No WAY could they get that big\...\"\
\
CUDDLEBUG\
\
The birds chirped softly in the distance as Nissa walked home in the
brisk winter afternoon. She had finished work early, and decided to take
a stroll through the park before heading home. Her thighs rubbed against
each other with each step, held in tightly by her strapless light green
dress which clung to her curves. Her breasts a modest DD, Nissa had
always imagined what it would have been like to be as busty as her
friend Sakura.\
\
\"Must be so hard to do things sometimes!\" She said as she plucked a
daisy from the ground, smiling. \"I have enough problems with this
thing\...\" She put a hand to her behind. From her DDs, traveling down
her slim waist, her hips exploded into a four foot diameter, cheeks
sticking two feet behind her and putting her dress to the very limit. It
threatened to show off the very edge of her bright green panties. She
rubbed it slightly, a look of concern on her face. \"I\...don\'t recall
being this big this morning\...did I eat too much today\...?\" Nissa
tried to push the idea away, continuing her walk home as she plucked the
petals from the daisy in her petite hands.\
\
The peach haired bottom heavy beauty rounded the corner of bushes
opening into the clearing in front of her apartment complex.\
\
Nissa paused at the street, looking both ways, and catching everyone\'s
attention with the massive spheres in her skirt bobbling from her
hurried shuffle. She went for the stairs.\
\
\"Oof\" Nissa grunted as her whole body lurched forward. Behind her, her
hips had caught on the railings of the stairway.\"W-when was it this
small?\" She wonder allowed, but pushed herself up, her butt squashing
on either wall with each step, making her give short little squeaks.
Step after step she felt her hips press into the stairwell until she
finally made it up to the doorway. \
\
\"Finally!\" She let out a breath of relief and pulled out her key from
her purse, opening her door and walking inside. Well, almost. Her hips
caught into the door frame. \"Wh-what?! Since when does that happen?\"
Nissa yelled as she flailed a bit, trying to pull herself into the
apartment. She felt her bum slowly squeezing its way forward, inch by
inch, but also heard the slight sound of fabric tearing.\
\
\"Oh no! The dress isn\'t going too, is it?\" Nissa asked herself
worriedly.\
\
SHRRRRRRRRRIP\
\
Nissa popped into the apartment without a skirt, just in her hyper tight
panties. She stumbled and landed on her hands and knees, her bare ass
bouncing off the ground like beach balls. the Cold air and tile made her
shiver.\
\
\"Nissa!? Is that you?\" Came the call of her red headed room mate.\
\
\"Er\...y-yes, its me\...\" Out walked Mano, wearing only a white
t-shirt and some panties. Her J cup jugs fit snugly inside her outfit. \
\
\"What happened to you, big bum?\" She asked as she stepped over to the
kitchen nearby, pulling some things out of the fridge. Nissa began to
stand, wobbling unsteadily upon her feet and grasping her caboose in
wonder.\
\
\"Uh\...M-Mano\...was I always this\...uh\...HUGE?\" Nissa asked
tentatively, afraid of what the answer might be\
\
\"Nissa, its like a universal law that you have a big ass. Just like
Sakura has huge titties. ISN\'T THAT RIGHT MOO MOO!?\" Mano ended with a
shout. There was some minor grumbling and a loud dragging noise coming
from the living room. Nissa gasped when she saw her best friend appear
in the door way.\
\
\"S\...S\...Sakura?\" Nissa\'s jaw almost dropped to the floor when she
saw her friend. Well, what she could actually see of her. Sakura seemed
to be nothing but a wall of boobs that crammed down the hallway. It
slowly made its way down, the pillowy cleavage pushing its way forward,
dragging its way across every possible surface. The cloth that just
barely covered her modesty must have been fashioned out of bedsheets.
Finally, she popped out of the hallway.\
\
\"What is it Mano?\" Sakura asked as she stepped over to the red-head,
moving forward so that she would be to the side of her, her bust
projecting forwards as far as 13 feet in front of her, as big as mid
sized sedans, each!\
\
\"Sakura\...what\...how\...uh\...\"\
\
\"I was just confirming with Nissa that her ass is huge and your boobs
are GIGANTIC!!\" Mano announced, walking over to the wall of breasts and
falling into the cleavage in such a trusting manner. A girly grunt was
heard on the other side of the fleshy mountains.\
\
\"Get out of my Boobs Mano!\" Sakura called over her breasts, eyes
wincing from the pleasure coursing thru her car bosom.\
\
Nissa stood there wide eyed. She couldn\'t remember ever seeing her
friend this big. Just like her ass. Something was up, but everything
felt normal. Nissa edged closer with her huge ass in jiggly tow, and
gently pressed her hands int other boob flesh towering over her.\
\
\"Unh\...Nissa\...what\'re you\...ohh\...\" Sakura tensed up, the
feeling of two people caressing her boobs was starting to overwhelm
her.\
\
\"So\...you\'ve always been this big Kura?\" Nissa asked as she massaged
the pliable and squishy flesh of her friend. Sakura bit her lip, her
eyes fluttering as a sudden surge of ecstasy rushed through her.\
\
\"Y-y-yeah\...for a while now\...ooohhh\...\" Nissa turned and placed
her bodacious booty onto Kura\'s rack, rubbing it in softly.\
\
\"And I\'ve always had such a gigantic rump?\" Sakura let out coos and
moans, but didn\'t answer the question\
\
\"EEEEEEEEEEP!!\" Nissa shrieked when a hand grabbed its share of meat
on Nissa\'s hip.\
\
\"Sakura has been this big for over two years now. You\'ve had your huge
ass for 3. Did you have too much fun in the park and forget everything
today?\" Mano asked, playing with all of the pliability in Nissa\'s ass.
Nissa moaned as she leaned into Kura\'s boobs, making their owners moan
in return.\
\
\"Kura here doesn\'t like to be touched so much either, so what do we
do? we touch\"\
\
\"B-b-but\...I don\'t remember\...any of that\...in fact\...I
don\'t\...unhh\...\" Nissa\'s head was cloudy. She could have SWORN her
friends were smaller, Sakura at least. Sakura was smaller than Mano in
the bust department, she was sure of it! Now she had two motor vehicles
for breasts? Something wasn\'t right. She could feel it in her gut. But
the more Mano squeezed and rubbed her flesh, the more her resolve melted
away.\
\
\"Hehehe\...you like that don\'t you, bubble butt?\" Mano asked with a
mischievous glint in her eye.\
\
Nissa\'s eyes half closed as she looked away, blushing deeply. Mano\'s
dainty hands worked her enormous booty in all the right ways, making
Nissa arch her back and raise her arms up. Mano grinned as she reached
all of Nissa\'s ass as best as she could. Nissa breathed heavy and
moaned happily under Mano\'s touch.\
\
\"H-hey!? Nissa! S-stop swaying your couch on me!\" Sakura shouted
faintly on the other side of her quivering giant masses.\
\
\"I\...I\'m sorry Kura\...it feels\...good\...mmmf\...\" Nissa was
powerless under Mano\'s grip as she pushed and pulled at her booty
meat. \
\
\"I know how we can make this just a BIT more fun, you two\...\" Mano
suddenly pulled a book out from between Sakura\'s jugs.\
\
\"HEY! Where did that come from?\" Sakura shouted, blushing slightly at
the fact that she had not noticed a heavy leather bound book stashed in
her cleavage.\
\
\"Its been there for a while, hun. Now hush while I give Nissa a bit
of\...fun time\...hehe\...\" Mano began waving her hands and muttering
an incantation, then stopped, grinning before closing the book and
stuffing it back down Sakura\'s rack. \"Things should be getting a lot
more\...cozier now\...hehehe\...\"\
\
Nissa was still swaying her butt against the Sakura wall of breasts.
left and right. left and right. She began to pick up the pace. her arms
lifted up high and behind her head as she really ramped up her booty
shake, slowly turning it into a sensual sexy dance, using kura to stay
upright with Nissa\'s lack of giant boobs to counter balance her ass\
\
\"Oooooooh MANOOOOOO What did you dooooooooooo!?\" She wailed as she
could help but keep moving, she was hot and bothered big time and had to
move it.\
\
\"Preliminaries\...should wear off in juuuuuust a moment\...\"\
\
Nissa continued her dance, gripping into her thick thigs as she leaned
over, shaking her booty harder into Kura\'s jugs.\
\
\"N-N-NISSA! SERIOUSLY! CONTROL YOURSELF!\" Sakura was awe struck. Never
had she seen her friend act so\...provocatively. \
\
\"I\...nnn\...can\'t!\" The dance resumed, Nissa continuing to shake it
as she leaned further forwards, her hands sliding lowed on her thighs as
she did so. Eventually, her energy ran dry and she almost collapsed.
Mano, however, caught her in her arms.\
\
\"Sexy as ever, booty blaster\...now then\...take a minute to rest\...\"
Mano leaned back onto Sakura\'s boob once again as a standing bed,
cuddling Nissa, her head resting into one of her J cup teats. She could
feel Nissa\'s thick hip dig into her own.\
\
\"There we go\" Mano grinned most devilishly.\
\
Nissa panted for a moment as she hung limp in Mano\'s arms.\
\
\"T-thanks Man-\" Nissa froze at an odd sensation as she was held in the
embrace.\
\
\"Whats wrong Nissa?\" Mano asked, with zero sincerity in her voice.\
\
Nissa\'s breasts were tingling like never before. She swore she could
feel the fabric of her dress growing tighter, yet there was no change in
distance between her and Mano. She could only look into Mano\'s smiling
face.\
\
\"Wh\...what are you\...\" Nissa looked down at her chest. She wanted to
scream, but couldn\'t make a sound. She just stared at them, mouth
agape, as they surged out from her body. Her breasts. They
were\...growing! A surge of emotion flowed upwards from her gut and
through her lungs, finally escaping her mouth. \"AHHHHHHHHHH! MANO!
MANO! STOP! STOP DOING THIS!\"\
\
I have NO idea what you\'re talking about.\" Mano said insincerely.
Meanwhile, her shirt seemed to be gaining some slack, and her collar
seemed to be receding\...\
\
Nissa\'s remains of her strapless dress groaned and creaked on her back
as her breasts pushed forward into Mano. Thanks to the elasticity it
held up very well under the weighty and voluminous assault of her
expanding breasts. \
\
THWIP\
\
The same couldn\'t be said about her D cup bra.\
\
\"UUUUUUUUUH MANOOOOOOOO!!!!\' Nissa cried out.\
\
\"WHAT ARE YOU DOING MANO!?\" Sakura shouted, her mountains bobbing on
the ground as their owner couldn\'t maneuver her boobs in her current
spot.\
\
Mano simply smiled. \"Just a donation\"\
\
\"DONATION?!\" Nissa cried out, feeling her dress stretch more and more
as the cups of her bra began to rise upwards. Her breasts scaled up and
up, like bread in an oven. The base of her breasts were firmly pressed
against Mano\'s body, so there was only one way they could travel: up
and out. The pressure this put on her collar was immense. It took little
time for her collar to begin shredding downwards towards the middle. Her
cleavage bulged nd put immense pressure on her shirt as it began to
spill upwards out of the top, muffining outwards and spilling onto Mano.
Mano, however, had done about the opposite.\
\
\"Mano\...what\...WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO MEEEEE?!\"\
\
\"Its simple. I'm making myself the only normal girl around here. No
more HUGE BOOBS FOR ME!!!\" Mano finally let go of Nissa, who fell to
her yoga ball ass. She bobbed up and down on her cheeks, wincing a she
cradled her freshly grown JJ cups.\
\
Mano meanwhile was sporting a perky pair of D cups, arching her back and
jumping up and down. Something she hadn\'t done in months.\
\
\"FINALLY!! IM NOT WEIGHED DOWN ANYMORE!!!!\" She pranced about the
kitchen with her new found lightness.\
\
\"You serious Mano?!\" Sakura yelled from behind her tits. She knew she
was powerless in this state, unfortunately. \"When I get my hands on
you\...I\'ll\...\"\
\
\"Good luck, tanker tits! I can actually move now! I can jump! Jog! All
of that is mine again!\" Mano giggled giddily as she stepped out of the
living room and back into her bedroom. Nissa stood in shock for a moment
before collecting herself and marching over to where Mano had fled to.\
\
But she didn\'t even make it halfway before she felt herself getting
pulled backwards, right back to Sakura.\
\
\"Uuuuuuunnnnnggggg\" Nissa began to lean forward more and more, her new
breasts swaying pendulously back and forth as she stomped her trunk
thighs. Waves of energy ran up and down her round legs and made her ass
bobble behind her.\
\
What ever it was, it was too much, and Nissa tilted back on her feet
like a falling tree and stumbled backwards. She just managed to turn
herself to nearly dive straight into Sakura\'s maw of tight cleavage.\
\
\"OOF! What was tha- Is that YOU Nissa?\" Sakura called over her bust,
feeling the dull impact on her bust and on her body overall.\
\
Nissa whimpered as she stopped being bobbled back and forth by her
enlarged bosom.\
\
\"I-its me! I-Im\....im stuck!?\" Nissa gasped as she tried to pull off
Sakura, but was unable to.\
\
Every tug and push forward from Sakura\'s boobs only resulted in her
sinking further within them. Eventually, she felt herself rising
upwards, up their walls, until her head squeezed out, letting her gasp
out for air. Then her jugs popped up on top of them. She kept rising
until Sakura\'s boobs only covered her monumental hips.\
\
\"How is this even happening?\" Sakura asked, able to see the top of her
peach-haired friend\'s head.\
\
\"I\...I\...don\'t know\...Mano did something to me\...now
I\'m\...ngghh\...\" The feeling was returning to Nissa\'s bosom, and
strong. She felt like floodgates were let loose and it was all cascading
into her bosom quickly, until\...\
\
A white shower rained down on Sakura\'s head. She shielded her face from
the cascading milk that shot out of Nissa propped above her.\
\
Nissa squealed and mewled as both her bust shot out milk and plumped up,
bigger and bigger as time passed.\
\
\"Its OOF! Noooot OOOOOFF!! S-stoooopING!!!\* Nissa cried as her
plumping breasts rocked her about.\
\
Below, Sakura was a squirming mess as Nissa\'s breasts crept along the
larger surface area. The increasing weight pinned Sakura on the spot,
letting the blue headed beauty rock her torso and sway her butt in the
dull prickling pleasure.\
\
\"Oooohhh\...Nissa? Why is that happening to you? I\'m the milky one
around here!\" Sakura looked on at Nissa as her breasts charged forward,
reaching down to her hips to rest upon Sakura\'s cleavage. Bigger, and
bigger, and bigger still they grew, big as over inflated beach balls,
then yoga balls, then bigger than even that. Nissa couldn\'t keep track.
When did her shirt break off? It must have been recently because the
tatters surrounded her on Sakura\'s bust. She screamed and mewled in
ecstasy as the spray of milk became more and more intense.\
\
\"M-M-Mano! She\...she made me absorb boobs!\" Nissa cried out between
her lustful moans.\
\
\"W-what!? That BITCH!!!\" Sakura pounded her fists into the walls of
her breasts, immediately regretting it as rings of prickly joy radiated
form her fists. She thought about it for a moment. \"B-but Niss\...mine
are all full of milk! Like, an endless supply!\" Sakura told her with a
nervous hint to her voice. \
\
\"B-but why am I not shrinking!?\"\
\
\"OOoOOOOOooooooH I d-d-dooont KNOOOOOOOWWW OOooooo gooooood make it
stooooooooop!\" Nissa lulled her head back and forth in her overloaded
haze of pleasure. She to was victim to the friction between the two sets
of breasts, making her eyes flutter and wince every few moments ontop of
the moans.\
\
Nissa wished she could think of the answer. Why was Sakura not
shrinking? Was it because of her sheer size? Was it something to do with
the milk? Milk\...that seemed right\...\
\
\"Ooooooh!\" Nissa felt a climax coming, a great build of pressure
coming into her mams. \"Sakura!\" Nissa panted, rubbing her body sized
boobs as they continued to swell outwards and upwards, resting squishily
upon Sakura\'s massive pair.\
\
\"What? Did they stop?\" Nissa shivered at the conclusion she had come
to.\
\
\"N-no\...in fact\...I think I know why\...you said you have limitless
milk\...right?\" Nissa\'s voice trembled, terrified of the answer.\
\
\"Yeah, something I have lived with for a while now, Niss.\" Nissa\'s
heart sank, far downwards, further than she had ever felt it sink. She
knew the answer. And it was bad news.\
\
\"S-S-S-Sakura\...\" Nissa choked out between her relentless moans, the
pressure still building. \"If I\'m just\...oooh\...absorbing your
milk\...then\...then\...I\'m never\...nnngh\...\" the pressure was
there. It had arrived. It was pressing into her, ready to burst. Sakura
realized what Nissa was trying to say. Her eyes widened in realization.\
\
\"SHIT! You\'re never gonna stop growing, are you?!\"\
\
\"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!\" Nissa shouted as her boobs plumped up
massively in one go, covering feet in all directions in a second. her
milk geysers turned into fire hose jets as they quivered form the
endless milk shot forth.\
\
Sakura tried hard to move Nissa off her, but being so big already simply
made her unable to do anything but enjoy the sensations as Nissa near
her current size.\
\
\"MANOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! GET YOUR FLAT ASS BACK HERE AND FIX
THIS!!!!!!!!!!\"\
\
Mano merely giggled, looking on from her bedroom.\
\
\"Give it a few more hours, girls. I wanna see if Nissa can get as big
as planets! Ooh! Maybe she can get her own gravitational pull! Haha!\"
Nissa moaned as another surge pushed through her, another few feet
adding on in seconds during her endless pushing growth.\
\
\"MANO! PLEASE! MAKE IT STOP!\" Mano chuckled, taking a bite out of an
apple as she watched.\
\
\"Nah, I\'m good.\" She replied after she swallowed the bite. \"I\'ll
check back in a little bit! Have fun girls!\"\
\
Mano vanished back into her room and shut the door.\
\
Nissa howled as her boobs were now plumping a handful of feet each puff.
Below her Sakura\'s moans were increasing as the friction and weight
increased.\
\
Nissa was now equal to Sakura\'s SUV sized breasts. without warning, the
double decker titty tower began to tilt. Down came the enlarged milk
spewing breasts with a very dull \'bwump\'.\
\
Due to the nature of the attraction, Nissa was now under her breasts,
and Sakura was on top of her, flailing like branches in the wind.\
\
Nissa laid there in fear, knowing she could not move. She couldn\'t stop
her growth. All that she could do was flail as her breasts continued to
puff bigger. More. And more. And more. For possibly forever\...\
\
Nissa\'s eyes flew open and she shot upwards gasping lightly and
clutching her chest. Double Ds, as they were before. She let out a sigh
of relief\
\
Nissa\'s hands instinctively flew to her posterior. It still surpasses 3
feet, but was not as huge as she had just witnessed it.\
\
\"T-thank goodness\...\...I-I really need to start exercising
more\....Sakura is right, I let my behind get out of control\" Nissa
sighed as she finishes feeling the twin balloons of flesh sticking out
behind her. She rolled over her pontoon cheeks onto her stacked pillows
for her back.\
\
\"My god Sakura was big\...hehe\...she could still walk\...\"\
\
\"It makes sense though\...Kura could always handle her boobies no
matter how big they got\...like the time Mano made them as big as
beanbag chairs and she could still charge at her! Hehe!\" Nissa giggled
sweetly, the memory of the dream already starting to fade. She yawned
and stretched, scratching her booty lightly as she stood, her night
shirt just barely making it past the edge of her panties.\
\
\"Oh well. Breakfast time!\"\
\
KARMA\'S PAYMENT\
\
Mano\'s breath was labored. Her chest heaved and struggled for breath.
\'Was it always this heavy?\' she thought. \'Did I always struggle like
this in the morning?\' The answer that came to mind was no. No it
certainly did not. Her eyes fluttered open slowly, feeling a mountain
weighing down upon her. It took her a moment for her to realize what she
was looking down at. Two rounded surfaces, both colored the same pale
tone of her skin. Whatever shirt she was wearing for bed was in tatters,
lying in pieces on and around her. The reality sunk in as she awoke
slowly.\
\
"Ho-ly SHIT!" She wanted to sit up straight fast, but she couldn\'t --
her tits were just too massive. She could feel them now, they reached
down, past her navel, spreading across her thighs, knees, and calves
until the very slopes of their bottoms rested upon her toes. Its when
she realized\...her tits were now as big as her. "That\'s\...not
possible\..." She rocked herself to the side, pushing herself to the
side of the bed. The weight on her was immense, and breathing was
troublesome, though somehow possible despite the immense weight upon
her. Slowly but surely the masses began to budge, lolling over, one boob
lifting over the other on a sort of axis as she tried to get on her
side. Eventually, she achieved the position and moved upwards sideways,
allowing her tits to fall forwards.\
\
The process dragged her downwards, causing her to fall on top of her
tits, something she hadn\'t planned. \
\
"UGH! What the fuck happened to me?! Why am I the size of two blimps all
of the sudden?!" There was a giggle at her door. She looked up and saw
Sakura. Sakura sported only a pair of JJs. Mano\'s old size.
"S-Sakura?"\
\
"Hey there tanker tits." Sakura said with a grin. "Enjoy the
enhancement?" Mano\'s eyes narrowed upon her supposed friend.\
\
"YOU did this to me?" Sakura shook her head defensively.\
\
"Nope. You did it to yourself. See, you messed with me and Niss for WAY
too long. You got what you deserved." Sakura said this all with a smile,
despite the harshness of her words. She turned on her heels, revealing
her pert, but moderately sized rump. "Oh, and be sure to check the rest
of yourself when you get the chance." She said with a wink before
walking back down the hall.\
\
Mano swallowed what little saliva she had, her mouth dry out of fear.
She brought a hand tentatively backwards to her butt. Much to her fear,
it stuck out much further than she remembered. She cranked her head
back, and as soon as she caught view of its medicine ball size, her eyes
shot open in fear.\
\
"OH GOD! IT\'S\...SO\...BIG!" She squeezed one of the cheeks, its form
so soft and supple, but firm and springy just like her tits. She laid
there, resting on her tits, unable to move. She felt like crying, but
couldn't manage any tears. Sakura\'s words rang in her head.\
\
"You did this to yourself. To yourself. Yourself\..."\
\
\"I did this\...but\...why\...?" Mano\'s head went foggy slowly as she
passed out\...\
\
"GAH!" Mano fell out of bed and onto the floor. She laid there a moment,
looking around, then automatically clenched her breasts. They weren\'t
back to her old Dds, but her JJs worked just fine compared to what she
had just experienced. Such a vivid nightmare, it shook her to the core.
She merely sat there, breathing heavy, then rubbing her ass, feeling its
petite curve against her hand.\
\
"Jesus Christ\...that was fucking\...terrifying\..." Getting herself
together, she stood, heading out into the kitchen to make some
breakfast. The very idea of getting that big was horrifying, disturbing,
but in the very back of her mind, the part she dare not notice,
it\...excited and intrigued her.\
\
"Morning!" Nissa called out happily to Mano, Sakura sitting at the table
yawning as she spooned some more cereal to her mouth. \
\
"Hey sunshine. You slept well, I see." Mano went to the fridge and
pulled out a bagel. "Unlike ol\' torpedoes over there." Sakura grunted
in response.\
\
"Not a fun night Mano. Not in the mood." Mano shrugged, then nodded.\
\
"Yeah, I guess I didn\'t have the best night either." Nissa looked at
both her friends worriedly.\
\
"You guys ok? Do you want me to make you some cookies later today? Ooh,
how about a cake? Or maybe a-"\
\
"No, Nissa, its ok. You end up eating most of em anyways, haha." Mano
poked fun, popping the bagel into the toaster. Nissa blushed in
embarrassment from this statement.\
\
"O-oh\...I\...ok\..."\
\
"Don\'t let her get to you Niss, we\'re gonna start working out together
today, alright?" Nissa looked to her azure haired friend and nodded. The
morning continued as normal, both girls letting the dreams slip out of
their minds\...but only for now.

CH 6: Sakura\'s New Spirits

A silence hung in the air. Dust particles danced in the light rays
shining in through the blinds. The same dust that coated the same books,
artifacts and precious gems for who knows how long. Cabinets,
bookshelves, cluttered tables. Tiffany did her best to keep things
organized, and thankfully, due to her new employee Sakura\'s assistance,
the place had begun to look brighter and brighter with each day.\
\
The attic door swung open. Wooden stairs flew downwards, the dust flying
up from the hardwood floor. And at the very top stood the hourglass
figure that was the spell crafter herself. Tiffany Massing. All dolled
up already, prepared to tackle the day as she always did. Dark red
corset that hugged her curves tightly, a plump, round bosom that
muffined from the collar. Her butt, which was still reverting to its
normal size, was still her dominating feature, that and her wide hips,
which just barely beat her shoulders in width. She smiled, her ruby red
lipstick shining in the sun as she stepped downwards, observing the dust
as it settled back to the floor.\
\
"I suppose today is vacuuming day, right Whit?" Her faint British accent
rung in her voice still, even though she hadn\'t lived there in a good
120 years. Her little orange sock puppet flew to her side and nodded.
"Let Sakura know that she has that duty today. I\'ll be organizing the
new maerchandise we got in yesterday."\
\
Whit held his nub hand to his forehead in a salute.\
\
"Yes ma\'am!" And he flew off, ready to take care of his own
responsibilities. Off to the bookcases. Atop the bookcases were various
statuettes and artifacts, kept out of children\'s reach due to
their\...possible outcomes. Indeed, they were some of the most powerful
things Tiffany kept out in the store, but she made sure they were
stable. In all of Sakura\'s month of working there, she hadn\'t once at
knocked a single object from those high shelves. Maybe a gem or two from
the lower shelves, but nothing that would do significant damage.\
\
Whit floated through, daydreaming. Even though it had never happened, he
oh so wished that it could sometime. He at times felt tempted to push
something close to the edge and watch Sakura\'s lovely plushy caboose
knock into the shelf, only for the object to plunge its way into her
pants and do its work. But Whit couldn\'t do that to her! For one, she
had been working long enough at the shop for him to develop a sort of
bond with hert. He trusted her, and he expected that she did the same of
him. He didn\'t want to abuse said trust. So he kept these ideas to
himself, and relished in the fact that she allowed him to rest inside
her bosom throughout the work day.\
\
"Whit! You alright?" The yarn-sewn toy shook its head and nodded,
continuing his work, still occasionally losing himself in busty
daydreams.\
\
Tiffany sighed. She knew exactly what Whit was thinking of, but it
couldn\'t be helped. Was she jealous? A bit. For reasons that she
couldn\'t tell Sakura\...yet. The time would come, but for now, she
needed to keep it under wraps. For her own sake. \
\
Tiffany opened the till, brushing her dark red hair away from her
glasses as she counted the money, placing it inside the register. She
stood there for a minute, writing down numbers and taking calculations.
\'Today is special\' she thought. \'Sakura will get to meet her too.
Ooh, I\'m excited! I haven\'t seen her in ages!\'\
\
Just then, the door opened with a light "tinkle", the bell letting out
its soft alert that someone had entered the store. The blue haired
bombshell herself had entered the store, but in a more unusual attire
than Tiffany was used to seeing her in.\
\
Bowling ball sized masses of pink marshmallowy softness bulged from a
very tight neckline. Behind they floral clad pillows was their owner.
Her blue hair was done up in a very pretty ponytail. She still had
makeup on, which hid the slight hang over she was nursing with a coffee.
2 sturdy straps hefted hr frontal baggage and kept them aloft. Her phone
poked out of her tight inviting cleavage.\
\
Her dress hugged her every curve almost like a second skin, with small
bunching wrinkles where the only slack was possible to have. Her wide
hips flared out in floral print, and her skirt ended scandalously just
below the bottom curve of her taught booty.\
\
She paused in the doorway, putting her arm out and leaning on her elbow
while her other hand held her coffee\
\
\"Damn Mano\....made my bra vanish\". Her nips could just be seen with
the light and shadow contrasts.\
\
Sakura hauled herself in and flopped onto the couch next to the doorway.
Her bust was sent into a violent torrent of wobbles as the impact
disturbed their rest before they settled with the help of her hands.\
\
\"There you are dear! A bit late today, I see?\" steps over and sits on
the armchair next to Sakura, pulling out a rag and dusting here and
there as she lounged. \"Lots of partying last night, I assume?\" Tiffany
remarked with a grin, polishing down the ornate lamp that stood on the
end table nearby\
\
Sakura simply grunted in the affirmative. She was still trying to wake
up fully.\
\
\"Remind me never to do shots again\" She groan as she covered her eyes.
Tiffany laughed hard and slapped Sakura\'s leg lightly.\
\
\"I never took you for the party type, dear. Is the headache bad?\"
Tiffany asked with a mixture of curiosity and concern\
\
\"It was\...its slowly going away though\" Sakura shifted on her back,
making her oversized bosom jostle in response. This seemed to alert the
spider sense of a certain sock puppet that zoomed into the scene out of
nowhere.\
\
\"BLUE!\" Whit cried out happily. Sakura quickly covered her ears. He
dove in without a second thought, nuzzling into the soft mounds of flesh
that could encase his full body. How he longed for this every single
morning. Sure, Tiffany had an amazing rack of her own, and Whit loved
that too. But Sakura\'s was so\...special. Soft. Squishy. And ENOURMOUS!
He popped his head out and looked over at Tiffany, who gave him a harsh
look in response.\
\
\"Miss Mizumi isn\'t feeling well, Whit. Could you please give her some
peace?\" Whit felt a hand gently pat his head.\
\
\"Hey Whitty\....I\'m gonna need a moment or two\...s-so just\....stay
still for a bit\" Sakura said gently. Tiffany\'s eyebrow twitched but
she let it go as Whit complied. She contained her huffs, but stood, and
swiftly made her way back to the counter.\
\
\"Well dear, when you collect yourself, you\'ll be doing vacuuming duty
today. I\'ll be in the back sorting out our newest wares. Also, I have a
friend coming in later this afternoon. I\'d love for you to meet her.\"
She said to Sakura with a smile. Sakura perked up slightly and tried to
look over her bosom at Tiffany.\
\
\"A friend?\" Whit\'s small sock ears stick out like periscopes,
listening in on the ladies\' conversation.\
\
\"Mhm! An old friend from back when I lived in England. She was a flat
mate of mine for a bit, then she moved out to Ireland to pursue some
more of her wild spirit chasing. She was always crazy about that sorts
of stuff.\" Tiffany chuckled in reverence, memories of her old friend
flooding back into her mind for a brief period. She sighed happily, then
clapped a few times quickly. \"Alright, chop chop! Time to get to work!
I want this place to look spotless before she arrives!\"\
\
Sakura was still having trouble getting her body to work with her.
Tiffany chuckled and walked back over to the blue bombshell and grabbed
her neckline and tugged on it.\
\
\"Get on up, Miss Bosoms Boom Boom\" With that simple tug, Sakura was
lifted to her feet. She wobbled in place for a moment, then got back to
the flats of her feet, steadying herself.\
\
\"Th-thanks\...I think\...\" Sakura muttered awkwardly as she rubbed the
back of her head.\
\
\"Its no problem at all dear. Now then, time to get to work!\"\
\
After nearly an hour of some tea and temple massage thanks to Whit,
Sakrua was on her sholess feet and sweeping the attic. The sound of
creaking from the floorboards was match by that of Sakura\'s heavy
bowlingball bosom. Coupled with Whits frequent movements her top was
straining to contain the twin spheres and the sockupent.\
\
\"Doing alright in there?\" Sakura asked as she swept, her bust wobbling
back and forth from her actions, taking the sock puppet for a ride. He
didn\'t seem to mind, however, and merely smiled back up at her.\
\
\"Just fine Blue.\" Sakura giggled. She enjoyed this little nickname
Whit had given her. He was so affixed to colors and strange quirks.
Tiffany was Crimson to him, and Nissa was Peach. Mano was Red, for
whatever reason. Some customers he named Loco and Angel. It was such a
cute little quirk, at least to her it was.\
\
\"Good to hear.\" She replied, continuing her sweep and cradling Whit
simutaniously in her hammock of boob.\
\
Sakura continued her chore for a bit longer before she heard voices
downstairs. Whit nearly exploded form the depths of her cleavage, making
her giggle formthe tickle. \
\
\"CRIMSONS FRIEND!!!!!\"\
\
Sakura stared after the speeding sock puppet as he gflew downstairs at a
breakneck pace. Setting the broom aside, she made her way down to the
shop floor, and saw the friend in question. \
\
She was quite the interesting person in terms of looks. Donned in a
stereotypical witch outfit, her hair was golden brown and draped down in
waves to her shoulders. The glasses upon the bridge of her nose were
huge, and she looked like she had to push them up very frequently.
Pointy black hat, cloak, the whole get up seemed so\...silly. But
otherwise, she seemed relatively normal, chatting away casually with
Tiffany as the two exchanged jokes and compliments alike.\
\
Whit flew past the pair so fast both shrieked as he crashed into the
back room.\
\
They turned their heads back around when they both heard a fleshy Bwoomp
and a feminine OOF! to go with it.\
\
\"Ah, Sakura, just in time to meet Autumn\". Tiffany gestured to her
auburn haired friend. Autumn stared with her mouth open as she shuffled
over to examine Sakura\'s chest.\
\
Hard at work I See. is this a condition of employment?\" Autumn grinned
as she turend back to Tiffany.\
\
\"No, no, this is just\...employee error\...\" Sakura answered for her,
an embarrassed ring in her voice. She stepped forward, regaining her
footing and planting herself right near Autumn, outstretching her hand.
\"the name is Sakura Mizumi.\" Sakura said with a smile. Autumn smiled
back, taking hold of Sakura\'s hand eagerly with both of her own.\
\
\"Well its very nice to meet you, Sakura! I\'ve heard sooooo much about
the newest employee here! Its awesome to finally meet you!\" Autumn\'s
smile glittered brightly, her teeth so white it almost dazzled Sakura
out of consciousness.\
\
\"Talking about me already Tiff?\" Sakrua asked with a joking single
arched eyebrow. Tiffany laughed. \
\
\"What can I say? You\'re the only girl to blow herself up nearly
double, and walk like its nothing\"\
\
\"Its certainly impressive, I can say that.\" Autumn stated, circling
Sakura and getting a good look at all angles. This brought out a slight
pink blush across Sakura\'s face, but she tried not to make a fuss.
\"Now then\...the reason I came here, Tiff, was to show you
something\...\" She withdrew the small black purse from her shoulder and
began digging through it. Her whole arm seemed to sink down into the
small knapsack, Sakura watching bewildered as she dug within it. \"Aha!
There you are!\" Finally, her arm came back up for air, holding a small,
white glowing orb, no bigger than a softball. \"Here it is!\"\
\
Tiffany and Sakura eyed the orb of light. Even Whit managed to untangle
himself from his backroom mess to look at the glowing item.\
\
\"Your showing me a crystal ball nightlight because\...?\"Autumn laughed
at Tiffany\'s statement. \
\
\"Not a nightlight, silly! Its a spirit container! You see, I was over
at St Richard\'s down in the Parralax Dimension. You know the one?\" She
spoke as she sat near Tiffany\'s counter on a stool and leaned back,
hefting the crystal ball up and down on one hand.\
\
\"Er\...is that the one with the time loop?\" Tiffany asked, uncertain.
Autumn shook her head and sighed playfully. \
\
\"No silly, that\'s Morifey. Parralax is the one with the HUGE spirit
population. I managed to get my hands on a few! And I keep them in this
ball right here!\" She extended the orb in both her hands, presenting it
like a child would one of their treasured art projects. \"They are super
attracted to heat and round objects, so they zoomed to this thing like
it was chicken feed!\" Sakura leaned in to get a better look at the orb,
almost entranced by it\
\
\"W-what do you mean by spirits?\"\
\
\"Not entirely sure yet. I grabbed a few of them, just to see what they
may do. Time will tell, but I thought I may show them to Tiff before I
perform my own experiments\". She said this with a wink before placing
the orb on a safe place upon the table nearby, looking back over at
Tiffany. \"But that can wait a moment. I believe you said you had
something for me in the back?\"\
\
\"Oh yes! Thank you for reminding me. This way\" Tiffany motioned her
old friend to the back, leaving Sakura with Whit and the orb.\
\
\"So she has a bunch of spirits in this thing?\" Sakura asked, tapping
the ball gently. As if out of a spooky movie scene, a little white
amorphous flame rose out of the ball. Its center was very reflective.\
\
\"Eep! What\...what is that?\" Sakura yelped, taken aback by the sudden
puff that rose from the ball. Smoke billowed out from its form, and it
merely floated in place, just as Whit did. It seemed\...intrigued by
Sakura. She couldn\'t put her finger on it\...\
\
The spirit swayed back and forth, gently rising like a loose balloon
escaping gravity. it rose higher and higher until it was out of arms
reach, eyeing Sakura all the way up.\
\
\"That\'s so cool! So these are what spirits are like?\" Sakura spoke
allowed as she reached up with a finger outstretched. Her bosom heaved
over her neckline. The spirit seemed to just act impulsively, shooting
down the tight line of bosoms begging for freedom form the party dress.\
\
\"H-HEY! GET OUTTA THERE!\" Sakura\'s hand instinctively reached down
her dress, grabbing around for the intruder. But none was found. She
pulled her collar down, observing her long line of cleavage. There was
nothing. No spirit to be seen. Only a puff of smoke rose from her opened
collar. Sakura swallowed nervously. \"W-where\...where did it go\...?\"\
\
Sakura suddenly felt an odd sensation in her boobs. She immediately
grabbed them, then immediately let go as per the results of some of
Tiffany\'s favorite spell work. Her breasts seemed to round out more
than usual, fighting the neckline of her dress for the muffin effect.
They even seemed to have a bit more shine to them.\
\
Suddenly she felt an intense tickling feeling shoot form her right
breast to the left, making her front sway in that direction
continuously. Then seemed to have no weight about them as the bobbled
form the movement and her laughing\
\
\"OMG W-what was that!?\" She giggled, only to have it happen again,
eliciting another bit of laughter.\
\
As Sakura laughed, with the spirit swimming about in her breasts, the
orb on the counter began to glow. Whit stared at the orb wide eyed, then
back at Sakura, then back at the orb.\
\
\"Uh\...I don\'t actually know what\'s going on right now\...\" Whit
muttered. Sakura stifled her laughs back and wiped a tear from her eye.\
\
\"Wh-wh-what do you\...mean?\" She asked, still trying to regain her
breath. Whit stared at the ball as the glow slowly intensified. Brighter
and brighter until a soft \"poof\" noise was made. The spirits hovered
there above the orb for a few seconds, merely eyeballing Sakura\'s
chest. They could sense that there was one of their own in there, and
they wanted to join it very desperately.\
\
\"Don\'t even think about it!\" Sakura yelped, crossing her arms over
her bosom.\
\
The spirits continued to circle the table and sphere, eyeing Sakura as
they moved close in their orbit. Two spirits pulled off in a rogue like
fashion from the rest and zipped at her with surprising speed. Sakura
barely had enough time to pull her bust back when they entered at the
nipples. The reaction was euphoric for the owner of said orbs.\
\
\"OHHHH KAY THAT\'S\...NNNGH!\" Sakura doubled over, shaking as the
pleasure spiked and coursed through her body. This time was different.
Its as if her body was imploding with the spiritual energy, like a sun
was exploding in each of her breasts. She gasped, dropping onto the
chair behind her, arching her back and thrusting her chest out. \"OH MY
GOOOOOD!\" Sakura shouted, her breasts quivering with the movement. Then
she looked down and saw something that made want to scream, but it
caught in her throat.\
\
Her breasts were growing, almost in a throbbing manner. Whit stared at
her, mesmerized, and slightly confused.\
\
They pulsed. They puffed up. They spread out. Her already huge bosom
swelled up in her tight party dress. They rose out of the open neckline
more than pressing into the dress, but still they tested the material.
Even thought it was a Body Con dress, small fabric thread creaks could
be heard.\
\
The pulsing eased, and her bust eventually stopped its self powered
quivering. She sat there looking at her boobs as they sat high and
mighty, blasting out of her dress in a dramatic muffining fashion.
Sakura tentatively brought her hands up and began to feel her new
masses.\
\
Instantly three small bright spots appears under her skin. She lurched
forward and gasped form the sudden spike in pleasure. She cradled them
for steadiness, only to have the spots appear in her right breast,
pulling her that direction.\
\
\"UUGH S-STOP!!!\" She shouted at her boobs, only to get a knock in the
face from an upwards bump. Whit could only stare as Sakura was slowly
tugged closer and closer to the orb on the counter. He gawked at her
enlarged form, being lost in its sheer size. He had no idea they could
get so much bigger! There must have been two whole cup sizes to it! His
trance was then broken by Sakura\'s outcry\
\
\"WHIT! I COULD USE A HAND HERE!\" Whit whisked over to her, observing
the predicament with a fervent face. \
\
\"Uhh\...uh\...uhh\...\" he stammered, looking from Kura to the orb in a
nervous fashion.\
\
\"The orb Whit!\" Sakura moaned out as she slowly tugged towards the
sphere that contained the other spirits, glowing brighter and brighter
as she approached. \"They want\...the others, I think\...\" Whit tried
some quick thinking. He tapped his head with his nubby hands until an
idea came to mind.\
\
\"Got it!\" With one quick zoom and push, he knocked the orb from the
counter, causing it to land with a loud CRASH on the floor. The spirits
in Sakura\'s bosom suddenly stopped tugging her. \"Did I do good?\"\
\
Before Sakura could even say a word, the rest of the spirits slowly rose
into the air in front of Sakura, like angels ascending to heaven. Sakura
gawked briefly before turning her wobbling spirit filled bust away. The
spirits in the air zeroed on on their target and began to float after
her\
\
\"EEEEEEEE GET AWAAAAAAAAAAY!\"\
\
Sakura dashed into the labyrinth-like bookshelves in the store, weaving
this way and that. The spirits hung upwards, but decided to stay low.
Whit thought he could almost hear them giggling, like it was a fun game
of chase to them. And with that, off they went. Six orbs dashing
outwards, splitting into two groups of three, hoping to capture the
busty babe and join their friends.\
\
Just as they wooshed away, Autumn and Tiffany suddenly burst into the
room.\
\
\"Whit! What happened? I heard a crash!\" Tiffany cried out to her sock
puppet assistant. Whit turned and smiled to Tiffany.\
\
\"The glow things are chasing blue cuz some are in her pillows, and I
stopped them from pulling her around\" He beamed, totally oblivious to
the current events set in motion by his actions\
\
\"O-oh no\...\" Autumn muttered.\
\
\"What do you mean \'oh no\'. Autumn, what do those things do?\" Autumn,
rubbed the bridge of her nose and sighed.\
\
\"Like I said before, those spirits are highly attracted to warm, round
objects\...which makes sense that they are now stored within
Sakura\'s\...er\...chest. I didn\'t think that there would be any huge
knockers in here aside from your own, and I was planning to be with you
the whole time so they wouldn\'t pull anything\...\" She sighed again,
rubbing her hands down her face in embarrassment. \"Now we\'ve got this
mess\...\" \
\
Tiffany put her hand on her friend\'s shoulder and looked at her with a
 kind, yet stern face.\
\
\"Look. You didn\'t know, and neither did I. No point in beating
yourself up about it. Now, since there are already some spirits in her
bosom as it is, what do we do to evacuate them?\" Autumn rubbed her foot
against the floor nervously and blushed.\
\
\"Well\...uh\...the only way for them to get out of an object
unwillingly is to\...incorporate them with the
object\...objects\...themselves.\"\
\
\"So\...?\" Tiffany asked, arching one of her eyebrows.\
\
\"So\...she uh\...she might be keeping them. The faster we get to them,
the quicker I can perform the charm and the less she\'ll have to
keep.\"\
\
Tiffany nodded. Knowing there was no time to waste, her and Autumn made
a mad dash into the maze of bookshelves. Meanwhile, Sakura was already
on the run herself. her breasts wobbled and bounced, more than she was
already used to, as the spirits jumbled and giggled around inside of
them. \
\
\"Knock it off! Get outta there!\" She grabbed her bosom and squeezed,
hoping to push them out, to no avail. Suddenly, she heard the familiar
sound of giggles, but the noise didn\'t originate from within her.
\"Crap\...gotta hide\...\" Sakura stumbled and plopped onto her inflated
bosom. A light \'oof\' came from her lips as they more than cushioned
her fall. \"That shoulda hurt mor-\" She scooted to the side as 2
spirits glided overhead.  Sakura covered her mouth hoping to not draw
attention. Even though she was plainly visible, the spirits vision
seemed very narrow. Her breasts bounced and quivered, trying to move
their owner. When that didn\'t work, the spirits returned to drumming
the inside of her bosom like a round of bouncy balls, making Sakura shut
her eyes and lightly moan. She could feel her nipples hardening and
sticking out through her overtaxed bra.\
\
The two spirits made their way over her head, another one secretly next
to her, calling for its brethren. As she laid there on her bosom, the
spirits approached, gliding over her back. Sakura felt herself get
lifted ever so slightly, snapping her out of her daze.\
\
\"Wh-wha-NO!\" She shouted, being flipped from the ground to facing up.
Before she could react, however, the three spirits dashed inside of her
bosom. She clenched onto her breasts, feeling them join their friends.
The pleasure buzzed and built even higher. She gritted her teeth as she
felt the familiar wobbles and rumbles. She knew what was coming next.
\"Oh God\...\"\
\
The faint sound of fabric being stretched and ripped reached her ears.
Threads snapped. Seams popped open. Flesh bubbled out of new openings.
The loud snap of her bra giving up on holding back the newly grown
breasts. Sakura arched on the ground as her bosom drove her mad from the
intense feeling. She pawed, cooed, mewled, moaned. They pushed her hands
away from her center as she attended to their physical needs.\
\
\"UUUGGG S-Stooooooooooooop!\"\
\
As if on command, they obeyed. But the damage was done. Sakura\'s
breasts were easily the size of medicine balls - perhaps even bigger.
Sakura gawked at them in horror. \"So\...big\...\" She gave one a poke,
and it wobbled and jiggled in response. The party dress was now
laughably unfit for her physique, and stuck to her like a second skin.
Holes riddled across its surface as small bubbles of flesh poured out
from them. But Sakura remembered something as she laid there: there were
still three more. She wasn\'t out of the woods yet.\
\
\"There\'s gotta be a way of getting them out\...just calm down
Sakura\...\" She coached herself as she slowly lifted herself to her
wobbly feet. Steadying her bosom, she made her way to a less open
location of the store.\
\
Meanwhile, Tiffany was searching for her blue haired apprentice with
Whit up high.\
\
\"How do you lose a girl with bowling ball knockers?\" Tiffany muttered
as she turned a corner. She managed to see a leg disappear down some of
the narrower aisles towards the back.\
\
Autumn was following the last 3 spirits, both wondering how to fix the
situation as well as taking notes on the spirits actions. She had her
eys glues on them while scribbling in hr note pad.\
\
Sakura on the other hand, was finding a good hiding spot. Inside a curio
cabinet? No, she wouldn\'t fit. Under a table? \...no, she wouldn\'t
fit. The same answer for every single spot. The spirits had blown her up
so much that she couldn\'t find a place to take cover. She cursed under
her breath as she continued her mad dash through the bookcases, all the
while wondering just how big Tiffany\'s store really was.\
\
Tiffany continued her run, taking a break only for a moment to catch her
breath. She looked down at her feet to see a torn garment of some sort.
She bent down and picked it up. A bra. A big one at that.\
\
\"She went by here\...and more got to her by the looks of it\...\" She
clenched her fist, the bra getting clumped within it. \"I really hope
she\'s ok\...\" With those words, she dropped the bra and continued her
pursuit of either Kura, or the spirits themselves.\
\
\"Oh wow\...how deep does this store go?\" Sakura gaped at the sudden
lack of light from the front of the store. She shuffled through the
curious selves, her inhabited bosom quivering form both her movements
and the spirits. \"At least its dark here so they will have a harder
time finding me\"\
\
She spoke too soon. From behind her, she heard the familiar giggling.
She turned slowly, her eyes wide with fear as the three mystical spirit
orbs made their way to her chest. \"Stay back! I\'m warning you!\"
Sakura held her arms up defensively. As she did so, her bosom shook and
glowed, calling for their brothers. The spirits on the outside
understood, and zoomed past Sakura\'s arms and into her chest.\
\
\"NOOOOOOOO!\"\
\
Autumn\'s ears perked up. \
\
\"She\'s close.\" Tiffany soon rounded the corner and had met with
Autumn.\
\
\"You hear that too?\" She asked. Autumn nodded.\
\
\"From the sound of it, she\'s not far off. C\'mon!\" They both
continued their run for the blue-haired victim.\
\
Sakura wrestled with her breasts. Her alarmed state grew more frantic.
Not from the feelings, but from the lack of immediate response from all
the spirits finally joining each other\
\
\"Out out out out get OUT!\" She pleaded as she shook her boobs about,
bouncing off of the shelves adjacent to her.\
\
\"Sakuraaaaaaa!!\" Whit called out from the darkess above the shelves.\
\
\"WHIT! IM HERE! THEY\'RE ALL IN ME NOW!\"\
\
Autumn and Tiffany perked up and looked to each other.\
\
\"NNGH!\" Sakura let out one last grunt of disapproval as she was thrust
to the bookcase behind her. The spirits melded and swam inside her bosom
until the 9 eventually became two pairs. The two pairs of large spirit
energy soon began to inflate. And with them, Sakura\'s breasts grew as
well.\
\
Fast.\
\
\"OH GOD!\" Sakura fell to her knees as her breasts thrust outwards into
her dress. The dress couldn\'t take much more. Threads popped on the
sides and across until the fabric spiderwebbed across her\...\
\
And soon there was no more fabric at all. her beach ball boobs flopped
out in front of her, glowing and wobbling in all their squishy glory.
Sakura stared at them horrified. The worst thought that she realized was
that\...they were still growing. And it only seemed to be speeding up.\
\
\"No No NO NO NO NO!\" Sakura shouted at her boobs, but was cut off when
she instantly felt the pleasure flooding her swelling mammaries. Like a
tidal wave, it all hit her at once, making her voice catch in her
throat. She instead snapped her head back as her hips rocked with a
powerful orgasm. It took several moments for her to make a sound.\
\
\"UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!\" She almost screeched in utter
relief. She opened her eyes and saw the glowing masses puffing up and
up, rising like dough in front of her. She gasped when her enlarged
nipples found the rough books on the opposite bookcase.\
\
Just then, Tiffany and Autumn rounded the corner, only to be greeted
with Sakura\'s nearly body sized breasts.\
\
\"Ho-ly shit!\" Tiffany gasped out. She marveled at Sakura\'s gigantic
bosom, packed firmly between the two bookshelves. \
\
\"Oh no! It\...it might be too late!\" Autumn muttered as she stepped
over to Sakura, observing her condition. Knowing there wasn\'t a moment
to lose, she pulled out a small book and began leafing through. She
found the page she needed, and pulled out the corresponding ingredients
from her robe. Sprinkling a white powder across her chest, and speaking
a few magic words, Autumn prayed for the best.\
\
Sakura\'s whining was dying down, as was the puffing of her massive
boobs.\
\
\"D-did you stop it?\" She asked in a fatigued manner. \
\
The glow did not subside however, which bothers Autumn all the more.
Autumn stared back at Sakura gravely, but with a hint of relief.\
\
\"In a way\...\" She patted Sakura\'s bosom as it began to shrink back
down. \"\...the spirits couldn\'t be vacated, unfortunately\...so I had
to\...convert them.\" Autumn muttered, ashamed that she had been the
cause of this debacle. Sakura didn\'t respond. Autumn peeked over the
shrinking bosom to find the owner sound asleep. \"Poor thing\....this is
the first account of these spirits possessing a human\....it must be
taxing\". Autumn said while scribbling away in her note book.\
\
Tiffany stepped up and felt the shrinking bust of her employee. A bright
light appeared under her hand before a spiritual force knocked it away.\
\
\"YOW!\" Tiffany winced, shaking her and as colored smoke rose from her
palm.\
\
\"Careful!\" Autumn shouted. \"The conversion process leaves her body
highly unstable for a little while. Touching her is a really bad idea
right now! But she\'ll be fine. The spirits won\'t cause her any more
problems\...directly.\" Tiffany arched an eyebrow.\
\
\"What do you mean\...directly?\" Autumn put her notebook away and
pushed her two index fingers together nervously.\
\
\"Ehehehe\...well\...the only effective way to make her stop growing,
and to make the spirits calm was to convert them, as I said\...convert
them into\...milk glands\...\" Autumn blushed with embarrassment and
shame as she said the words. Tiffany didn\'t respond immediately,
looking at her friend for a few moments.\
\
\"Say what?\"\
\
\"I made the spirits into mammary glands\" Autumn repeated, blushed and
poking her fingers together. \"See, spirits of a certain size give out
constant energy, which is what we were seeing with Sakura\'s bust. She
was like a spirit energy balloon. So, to keep this from happening again,
I made them milk glands\"\
\
Tiffany gawked for a moment, still not catching on to the logic behind
the magic. \"How does that help her?\"\
\
\"Instead of blowing up out of control, she just\....uses the ladies
room and makes spirit energy milk\...\" Autumn shrugged.\
\
\"That doesn\'t sound like a good trade off at all!\" Autumn flinched at
Tiffany\'s outburst. \"Sure, she was massive\...but you could\'ve
done\...something! Right?\" Autumn shook her head in denial.\
\
\"I didn\'t know much about these spirits\...no one did. The whole
reason I brought them here was so that we could research them
together\...for old time\'s sake\...\" Tiffany could see the tears
forming in Autumn\'s eyes. She let out a sigh.\
\
\"Goddammit Autumn.\" She was still upset that her old friend had now
brought upon a milky curse to her new employee. But it couldn\'t be
helped. Sakura had soon shrunken to a medicine ball size, still several
cup sizes above her basketball bosom, and stopped growing. \"She still
seems a bit\...swollen\...\"\
\
\"Eh\...yeah\...about that\...\"\
\
Several hours had passed form the spirit commotion. They had managed to
drag the incredibly heavy Sakura to the couch, and even fit her in a
huge T-shirt Tiffany had lying around. \
\
As Sakura slept, Tiffany and Autumn did whatever test they could to
study the remnants of the spirits. Whit, being the schmooz that he was,
was snuggled between Sakura\'s mounds.\
\
Sakura groaned as she began to come to.\
\
\"Hey there sunshine\...\" Tiffany muttered, sitting next to Sakura as
she stirred.\
\
\"Unnhh\...Tiff? What\...what happened?\" Tiffany smiled in a
bittersweet sort of way. She was happy to see that Sakura had regained
some normalcy in terms of bust size, but\...\
\
\"Well\...dear\...look down\...\"\
\
Sakura slowly looked down.\
\
\"I see white\" She said simply, still waking up.\
\
Tiffany chuckled. \"Takes a guess whats under the white\...\" She
reached out and rested a hand on one of the peaks of white.\
\
Sakura took a few moments to feel this touch.\
\
\"W-wah?\" Sakura went to get up and was met with more resistance than
usual. She blinked. It took her a moment to soak this all in. Slowly,
she raised a tentative hand to the accused area. She latched her hand
on, and felt it sink into the pillowy surface. This surface\...was so
squishy, so soft\...and felt as if there was a slight slosh beneath
it. \
\
She then realized that these were, indeed, her breasts.\
\
\"Holy shit!\" She cursed, sitting upright immediately. Her breasts
shook and wobbled. She could even feel something moving around in them
in response to her movements.\
\
\"Its sorta my doing\" Autumn chimed in. \"Its all I could think to do
to keep you from blowing up like you did\"\
\
Sakura felt her front up more as she looked at Autumn.\
\
\"What do you mean? Why couldn\'t you get them out?\"\
\
\"Well\...they were a complex breed. If I tried to get them out, it
could\'ve resulted in some\...gruesome things\...\" Autumn shivered.\
\
\"Like\...?\" Sakura asked, lifting one of her boobs up and down with
one hand, feeling it slosh with each movement.\
\
\"Well, for starters, your breasts could have turned inside out.\"
Sakura\'s heart dropped at that idea.\
\
\"O\...kay, well, never mind\...\" Sakura relinquished her curiosity and
brought her attention back to her now medicine ball bloated mams. \"Why
are they so\...sloshy?\" Autumn looked to Tiffany briefly.\
\
\"Well\....that\'s all milk\....so you wouldn\'t\....you know\....grow
like you did\"\
\
\"M\...milk? So\...I have milk in me now?\" Sakura asked, mildly
horrified. Autumn looked back at her and nodded.\
\
\"Yep.\" Sakura was baffled. She shook her head, causing her bust to
sway with her movements.\
\
\"So what, I just have milk balloons on my chest? Is the milk stuck in
there?\" Just as she said it, she felt her breasts grumble. Her nipples
became erect. She felt a strange pressure building up from the back of
her chest and to her nipples.\
\
\"Nope.\" Autumn replied bluntly.\
A shower of milk spewed from the erect nubs under the T shirt. Several
streams rained out and showered Sakura\'s legs.\
\
\"Oooooooooooo\" Sakura cooed, feeling the relief of pressure and
tightness ebbing away as her breasts sprayed their contents.\
\
\"Woah\" Autumn looked on in awe. What Sakura was missing was her milk
had a slight white glow to it. \
\
Spirit charged milk.\
\
Tiffany ushered Sakura to stand. \"Lets get you to the bathroom before
my old couch gets moldy and spirits start flying out of it\"\

...

\
\
\"So im just a pair of Milk pumps now\" Sakura semi whined as she leaned
on her still lactating breasts. They had lost some of their uber
firmness, but were still fairly full and she could feel it.\
\
\"That\'s a blunt way to put it\" Autumn said from outside the bathroom.
\"Again, I\'m REEEEAAALLY sorry\".\
\
\"How goes the leaking?\" Tiffany asked, trying to keep the mood light.\
\
\"I\'m getting there, but holy\....COW!! I can hold WAAAAAAY too much at
once!\"\
\
\"Well, it could have been worse. You were HUGE! Bigger than you\'ve
ever gotten, I think. But that\'s just a guess, really.\" Tiffany told
her as she continued to ease milk from her jugs.\
\
\"That\'s\...kinda scary\...\" Sakura replied, the milk stream turning
into a dribble. \"There we go\...\" Sakura stood, putting the large
shirt back onto her mams. Still soaking wet with milk, she decided to
ask Tiffany for a new one, who happily obliged.\
\
The three stood near the entrance, bidding their farewells.\
\
\"Well\...Autumn\...it was crazy but\...it was nice to meet you\...\"
Sakura knew that, despite Autumn proactively being the cause of her
breast growth (and constant milking), she was still a kind and
thoughtful person. Autumn acknowledged this and offered her hand. Sakura
took it and they shook. Tiffany leaned in and gave her old friend a
hug.\
\
\"Well\...I hope I get to see you both again real soon!\" She chirped
before opening the door. \"Don\'t let those get too unruly, okay?\" She
said with a wink. Sakura chuckled a bit at this before Autumn closed the
door behind her, disappearing in a flash. 

...

\
It had been three weeks since Autumn had visited. Things slowly started
to become normal once again. The dull days of making one or two sales.\
\
Sakura bounced down the street in a chipper mood. Clad in a work out top
that covered her sloshing front and some grey yoga pants, she swayed her
toned behind down the street. Cars slowed down as they passed her, some
even rear ended one another. Strangers stared, pointed, gasped, laughed,
and chastised.\
\
That didn\'t matter to Sakura as she bounded up the steps to the shop.
Her breasts, each over a foot wide individually, bounced and sloshed
happily in her spandex top. Their upper slops gleamed with the healthy
sheen of her workout.\
\
She opened the door and disappeared from the gawking world.\
\
\"I\'m here!!\" She called out, stretching her arms\
\
\"BLUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUE!\" Whit zoomed into her bosom and dug in, his head
popping out and looking up at her a few moments later. Sakura smiled
down at him.\
\
\"Now now, Whit! Try not to rustle them too much\...I think I\'m due for
a milking here pretty soon\...oof\...\" Sakura muttered as she set her
bag down. \"Tiff?! You around?!\" Sakura called out.\
\
\"On the way dear!\" Tiffany called back, descending the stairs and
greeting her employee. \"How are you doing this afternoon?\" She asked,
brushing her bright red hair away from her eyes.\
\
\"Good! only caused 2 fender benders and I haven\'t soaked myself in 5
days. I think I\'ve got this milk thing finally figured out\". Sakura
smiled as she patted the sides of her heavy bosom. A faint hollow noise
could just be heard.\
\
Whit was not paying attention to them at all. \"Mmm\...so warm\...and
soft\..." Tiffany\'s eyebrow twitched. She snapped her fingers and Whit
suddenly was thrust out of her cleavage and onto the counter, gently.\
\
\"Behave yourself, now! If I catch you dropping in there at any point
today, you\'re in big trouble. Got that?\" Tiffany threatened. Whit
nodded, looking over at Sakura, who gave him a wink.\
\
\"Don\'t worry Tiff. I\'ll keep an eye on him. Make sure he stays out of
trouble.\"\
\
\"Good. Now get those things emptied, today we are changing out
merchandise\". Tiffany smiled as she turned and left.\
\
Sakura waited for Tiffany to round a corner. She tugged her neckline
down and winked at Whit again\
\
Whit happily jumped in and snuggled down deep inside her cleavage. \
\
\"Thanks Blue!\" Whit whispered. Sakura chuckled.\
\
\"No problem socky. Glad these could come in handy.\"

CH 7: Nissa\'s Embarrassed Bust

Nissa\'s booty swayed. It jiggled. With every step, a thunderous quake
of ripples crossed its flesh. Every day she had worked out, gone for
walks, and changed her diet as a result\...even after all of that, she
still had a prolific booty. Even with this in mind, she was completely
flat everywhere else. Well\...ALMOST everywhere else. Her DD cups still
stuck nice and perky in front of her. And her hips were near as wide as
her shoulders.\
\
It mortified her.\
\
Nissa wasn\'t necessarily ashamed of her body. She was proud of who she
was, an independent woman that had taken up photography as a
professional career, and she even modeled on the side if need be. She
rarely ever wanted to show off her body, but when all other options were
empty, she did what she could to help out. It wasn\'t her fault that she
was cursed with such lovely breasts, or an outlandishly huge ass, which
didn\'t seem to be getting any smaller these days.\
\
Part of it was genetics. When Nissa hit puberty, things flared out
drastically. Her butt seemed to gain a great amount of mass within a
year, and it kept going until she was 19. Even then, she had the biggest
booty in all of high school, possibly even at the arts college she
studied at! And her breasts, while not nearly as huge as her friend
Sakura\'s, were still an impressive size for someone her build. DD may
not SOUND like that big of a size, but on such a fit woman, the curves
exploded out from her.\
\
Nissa was the very definition of a bottom heavy hourglass.\
\
And today, she was paying her friend Sakura a visit at her own job:
Tiffany\'s Shop of Oddities. She was always nervous going there -- after
all, the curse that was placed upon her was made in that store. But at
the same time, this curse had vastly improved her life! It had motivated
her to exercise and eat more healthy things. Was she gluttonous
beforehand? At times, yes, but Nissa never considered herself a pig. And
neither did any of her friends. But any of the sweets that she indulged
in would always go into her butt -- thus making it erupt in size and
mass within a few days. Luckily, she had gotten it down to a more
manageable size -- shoulder width, which she was ok with. Her butt could
still honestly be considered a "shelf".\
\
Nissa made her way into the shop, seeing the bright blue hair of her old
friend.\
\
"Kura!" Nissa chimed. Sakura\'s head perked up and she turned, giving
her friend a big smile. Her jugs, which weighed on her chest at about
the size of medicine balls, overshadowed everything else. While Sakura
definitely didn\'t lack in the booty department herself, she was nearly
pencil thin when compared to Nissa\'s caboose.\
\
"Niss! Hey, come on over here!" Sakura waved her friend over to the
table. "I was just about to finish up with this and lounge for the next
half hour. Getting work done early is always nice." \
\
Nissa nodded. "Yeah, I agree. I got off early myself today too!" She
replied with a giggle.\
\
"Why hello there Miss Sohvi!" A sultry voice passed from the back room.\
\
"Ah! Hello Tiffany!" Nissa said, a mild anxiety in her voice. Tiffany
still made her uneasy. While she had saved her from Mano\'s torments, it
didn\'t mean she hadn\'t both accidentally and purposefully made her
grow just as much.\
\
"Looking beautiful and radiant as always, my dear." Tiffany mused, her
British accent clinging faintly to her words. "Come to visit for a bit?
I don\'t mind, I have a visitor here myself\..." She turned to reveal an
auburn haired woman, complete with cloak and pointy hat.\
\
"Hi hi!" The woman greeted Nissa in a cheery voice. Nissa smiled broadly
at the woman\'s enthusiasm.\
\
"Hello!" Tiffany stepped to the side and let the woman move forward. \
\
"Name\'s Autumn, Nissa! Its nice to finally meet you! I\'ve heard so
much about your ass-I mean\...your association with modeling
photography!" Autumn corrected herself hurriedly. Tiffany leaned near
her friend\'s ear.\
\
"Nice save." She muttered sarcastically. Autumn stuck her tongue out at
her.\
\
"Now then, go on and have a seat everyone. I\'m going to finish up a few
things, then we can go get a few drinks. Sound like fun?" Tiffany
announced. All three girls nodded.\
\
"Yeah, sounds like a good time all around." Sakura chimed in, tugging at
her shirt to make it more comfortable. "Although, let\'s swing by my
place before we do\...shirt is getting kinda uncomfortable again\..."\
\
"You didn\'t let anything slip down in there did you dear?" Tiffany
teased with a wink.\
\
"I don\'t think so\..." Sakura reached a hand down and dug around,
coming up with nothing. "Nope! Must just be almost time to-" A gurgle
emanated from her direction. She blushed. "Ehehe\...right\...I\'ll be
right back\..." And with that, she rushed off to the bathroom.\
\
Autumn looked on at the bathroom door.\
\
\"Is she really okay with that?\
\
Tiffany chuckled as she set a box on the counter. \"Im very surprised
with her reaction. Despite needind to milk herself daily, she seems to
enjoy them in every way\"\
\
Autumn raised an eyebrow.\
\
\"Really? That\'s interesting\...\" Tiffany could tell from the look in
Autumn\'s eyes that she was thinking hard about something she didn\'t
want her to. \
\
\"Er, well, you two, sit here for a touch while I go assist Miss Mizumi
back there, will you?\" She ushered the two ladies to the table near the
entrance and sat them promptly, then promptly rushed up the stairs and
to the bathroom. Nissa just looked over awkwardly at Autumn, who picked
up one of the books from the side table nearby.\
\
\"So\...\" She muttered as she opened the book. \"\...you have a really
nice butt.\" Autumn stated bluntly with a smile.\
\
Nissa instantly blushed, fidged on her pontoon like behind stuffed in
the loveseat chair. \"T-thanks\....I guess?\"\
\
Autumn smiled briefly, letting her attention wander as if in a daydream.
Nissa looked at her curiously for a few moments before snapping her
fingers.\
\
\"OH! I\'m sorry\" Autumn apologized\
\
She dug her nose back into the book in her hands, leafing through pages,
trying to disguise her embarrassment\...and jealousy. Secretly, Autumn
had been coveting the curves of both Sakura and Nissa. Not so much their
looks per se, but their physics, motions, structures. Autumn loved
taking apart these sorts of things in her head, and studying them
closely.\
\
Nissa looked at her carefully. Autumn almost seemed to sense this as she
tried to hunch further down behind her book.\
\
\"Are you\...\...envious?\" Nissa asked.\
\
Autumn sputtered suddenly. Losing her grip on the book and letting it
land in a heap on the table. Her face was even redder than Nissa\'s just
was.\
\
\"WHA-WHA-WHA\...WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT!?\" There was a sudden moan
from upstairs, followed by the giggle of Tiffany. Nissa caught autumn
looking for a long time upwards.\
\
\"You want a bigger bust?\"\
\
Autumn sighed. She had been found out.\
\
\"Yes\...I\'ll admit, I wish I was a bit more\...robust, like you and
your friend\...\" She noticed Nissa\'s look. Not one of shame, humor,
but one of confusion, and somehow, empathy. \"Not for reasons you think,
though!\" Autumn said, raising her defenses up yet again. \"I just\...I
dunno, I think it\'d be good research if I\...had those myself,
y\'know?\"\
\
\"What kind of research do you do?\" Nissa asked, cocking her head to
the side slightly.\
\
\"Spiritual and manifestation science. I\'m basically a ghost hunter,
but not like those bogus ones on TV with those weird mics and cameras
and all that nonsense\...\" Autumn straightened up in her chair, feling
the pride of her job in her. \"I use magic, spells, tomes and other
supernatural and spiritual connections to contact with the ethereal. And
there are so many different kinds of spirits! Small, globular ones, tiny
little implike ones, big, humanoid ones!\" Autumn ranted on and on about
her career. Nissa looked on with admiration for Autumn\'s passion.\
\
Autmun continued on for a few minutes before taking the conversation on
a slight tangent from her career.\
\
\"I am responsible for Sakura\'s condition.\" Autumn suddenly stated.
Nissa perked up.\
\
\"What? What do you mean?\"\
\
Autumn leaned back as she looked into the book. \"I wasn\'t careful and
some strong spirits got loose, and got in her boobs. They were making
her grow big, and I mean BIG! Had I not stopped them by making them
her\....mammaries, we might have been inbetween them right now\"\
\
Nissa stopped for a moment, tyring to imagine her milk laden friend
bigger than a house.\
\
\"So\....anyway\...\" Autumn set the book down, reading off a spell that
had a blushing face. A huge green spark followed by purple smoke shot
out of the book, sending both girls reeling out of their chairs. \"I
don\'t think it worked hehe\" Autumn chuckled at her move.\
\
Nissa stared at her nervously. She knew what happened last time when
someone messed with Tiffany\'s books. She felt up her backside as a
reminder.\
\
\"Hehe\...yeah\...\" She played along. \"So um\...how long have you
known Tiffany?\" Nissa asked, trying to change the subject.\
\
\"Oh man, it must be like\...120 years now? Feels like soooooo long
ago!\" Nissa looked shocked. This woman didn\'t seem a day over 20!\
\
\"But\...but\...\" Autumn could already read the confusion on Nissa\'s
face, and let out a snicker.\
\
\"Tiffany\'s a spellcrafter. People like her live forever, basically,
until they decide they want to die. That\'s how spellcrafter\'s have
always been, and that\'s why there aren\'t that many of them.\"\
\
\"You would think there would be more\...\" Nissa replied, not following
Autumn\'s logic.\
\
\"Yeah, but remember, spellcrafters don\'t necessarily birth more
spellcrafters. The thought of them outliving their children can be too
much to bear at times. Its a weird topic, I know, and its not based in
science or logic.\" Nissa was reeling. So Tiffany was some sort of
otherworldly being that created growth spells that made her butt and
boobies grow to the size of houses?! The spells that Mano used\...they
were all hers? The thought made her shudder.\
\
\"Boo!\"\
\
\"WHAAAAAAA!!!\" Autumn almost jumped to the roof when she felt a wet
pair of masses press into her neck. Behind her stood a flushed and
panting Sakura, with her top very much soaked. Tiffany glided up
alongside her. \
\
\"So my milking skills are\....what is a good phrase\...\...\"\
\
\"Bad?\" Sakura offered.\
\
\"Lacking\" She smiled\
\
"Do NOT scare me like that again\" Autumn said sternly, still catching
her breath.\
\
\"Jeez, sorry, why are you so jumpy?\" Sakura asked, her milky tits
still resting upon Autumn\'s shoulders. Tiffany looked down at the table
as they chatted, and noted the book that Autumn held in her hands.\
\
\"Autumn\...have you been reading through my books again? You know what
I told you about-\"\
\
\"Oh please, Tiff, you know I have no idea how any of these spells work.
My forte is spirits, not magic.\" Autumn teased, sticking her tongue
out. She shivered, a drop of milk rolling down the side of her face.
\"Er\...Sakura\...could you perhaps\...move those please?\
\
Tiffany spoke up.\
\
\"Now now, Kura, I think she\'s had enough.\" Sakura sighed and stood,
drifting over to the other side of the table. \
\
\"Fine, fine\...\" Suddenly, she sprung forward, latching her boobs
around the back of Nissa\'s neck. \"BUT NOW I\'VE GOT YOU!\" Nissa
squealed and blushed.\
\
"KURAAAAA!" Sakura giggled as she rough housed with her friend.\
\
Nissa started to shift her shoulders into the large orbs against her.\
\
\"Ooooh no, I think my top got all wet.\" Nissa looked down, seeing that
the top of her bra line was now visible due to the wetness of her white
tank top. "Eep!" her flush of pink went to a shade of red.\
\
\"Whoops!\" Sakura promptly let Nissa go, who was busy playing with her
top. "Sorry Niss!" Sakura felt somewhat bad for embarrassing her friend,
but it was admittedly still a bit humorous to see Nissa flustered like
this. Nissa wiggled her shoulders and adjusted her bra straps, her face
scrunched in discomfort.\
\
\"Shoot, its all tight and what not. I think it shrank\...\" Nissa
muttered.\
\
Sakura turned to Autumn. \"You made my milk shrink clothes!\"\
\
\"No I did NOT!\" Autumn defended.\
\
\"Sakura, its fine, I think they just shrunk in the wash, and I didn\'t
notice until just now.\" Nissa defended Autumn, her sweetness not left
behind on people she hardly knew. \"Look, I\'m just gonna go home real
quick and change, and I\'ll meet up with you guys later this evening.
Sound ok?\" The trio nodded and bade Nissa farewell as she made her way
home.\
\
Nissa popped into the apartment in haste. Her top was feeling very
clingy now and she was desperate to be free of the confinement.\
\
She swayed her jiggling behind to her room and peeled off her shrunken
top. Her breasts her puffing over her bra mercilessly. With a quick
unlatch it sprang off her boobs and landed across the room.\
\
She proceeded to try on different tops, all feeling very snug.\
\
\"Oooooooh\" Nissa whined as nothing was fitting right. She eventually
settled on a snug dress that had some stretch. It packed her bosom in
nicely, while showing off their tops. It was a party dress Mano had
gotten her, and this was her first time wearing it.\
\
Nissa added a small white vest over her shoulders to make it look a bit
more classy, and to hide her braless nature.\
\
\"Ohh..what\'s up with these today?\" Nissa mused, poking the exposed
flesh worriedly. \"It can\'t be that\...no, it couldn\'t have
worked\...like Autumn said, her magic didn\'t work like Tiffany\'s
does\...at least that\'s what I THINK she said\...\" Nissa bit her
bottom lip. While the outfit she had on was cute, she felt it to be a
bit\...revealing, especially for her nice, yet bare, legs. She tussled
around in her closet and eventually found her yoga pants and managed to
stretch them across her enormous booty, with a bit of struggle here and
there.\
\
Nissa looked herself over again. They didn\'t look THAT much bigger. It
was probably just her imagination. All those clothes she tried on, she
had taken those to the dry cleaners yesterday because her washing
machine had bugged out. It must have just been a coincidence, and she
was just in too much of a rush this morning for her to notice.\
\
These were thoughts that helped wish away Nissa\'s deepest fears: that
she could somehow, someway, be growing. Her bust in particular. Seeing
her friend Sakura get breasts her size, and KEEPING them, was scary to
her. Nissa may have gotten a big backside, but at least she was able to
work it off some\...at least a little. Yes, it was just a smidge too big
for her liking\...but her boobs too?! She didn\'t know if she could
handle that\...\
\
Shaking her head, she grabbed her purse and walked out again. She needed
fresh air. A nice walk in the park would help clear her head. \
\
The park was not very busy, but there was a healthy amount of activity.
Kids, college students, mothers, it was a normal mixed group.\
\
Nissa bobbled her large bottom along the grass, catching the looks of
many individuals as she passed by.  Little kids pointing, frat guys
pulling down their sunglasses to get a better look.\
\
Nissa did her best to ignore the looks as she beelined for her favorite
bench under a large oak tree almost dead center of the park. At last,
she had made it, and planted her caboose firmly upon the bench, feeling
the flesh spread out across the wooden surface. She cooed at the warmth.
it had been in the sun all day. Nissa merely sat there, breathing in the
crisp air. She absolutely adored relaxing at the park. It put her in
such a state of peace\...even with the thought that perhaps her boobs
were about to bust through her shirt.\
\
She shook her head, getting the thought out, when she noticed something
out of the corner of her eye. She turned her head to see a small
squirrel scampering up near her. It took a few steps, stopped, then a
few more, then stopped. It eyed her curiously. Nissa smiled at the
creature.\
\
\"Hello there!\" She waved kindly at the small animal. The squirrel eyed
her curiously, taking the time to scratch at the ground around it. A
sudden gust of wind kicked up, blowing Nissa\'s hair into her face.
\"Ah!!\" From above, several leaves came whipping about her. She
crunched herself down until the weather passed. \"Phew! That was a big
wind, huh lil guy?\" She looked back at her new friend. It was now
looking at her intently, take a few paces towards her.  \"Huh?\"\
\
Nissa felt something prodding her bosom. She looked down to find an
offending acorn nestled cutely on her large bust.  A sudden flash of fur
passed her eyes as she watched a fuzzy tail disappear between her
breasts into her dress. \
\
\"EEEEEEEEEEEE GET OUT OF THERE!\" Nissa squealed loudly as she stood
from the bench shaking and wobbling about as the squirrel dug its way
down her cleavage. She grabbed and scratched at the creature as it
darted its way down and around her bosom, then around her back and to
her large butt, squeezing between her cheeks. The feeling made Nissa let
out a small squeak as she waggled her booty.\
\
\"GET OUT GET OUT GET OUT!!!\" Nissa pulled up her skirt, not even
remembering where she was or who was around her. She just wanted the
thing out. She pulled up her skirt, hoisting it above her prolific
cheeks, and felt for the squirrel. As quick as it had jumped down her
shirt, it jumped out of her panties and scurried away, acorn in its
satisfied mouth.\
\
Nissa froze as she realized her skirt was fully pulled up, and everyone
within earshot was looking at her tight underwear tugging on her huge
bottom. Before she could react, a sudden rush of intense feelings filled
her bosom, making her wobble on the spot and cup her breasts.\
\
Flesh slowly pushed out under the fabric of the dress, quietly making it
creak. Slowly but surely they swell up, closing the gap between their
current size and that of her head.\
\
\"Ooooooooooh gooooosh\" She whined, trying to pull her skirt down while
hefting her inflating globes. Her face was almost as red as Mano\'s
hair.\
\
\"S-stop! P-please!\" She continued her one handed wrestling match with
her skirt but was only dancing in a circle. She needed two hands. The
embarrassment made her want to crawl under the darkest place she could
to hide.\
\
Finally, she got a grip and tugged down with both hands, covering
everything up. But the damage was done and she knew it. Everyone within
the park had managed to get a glimpse of her exposed booty. As if it
couldn\'t get any worse, her bust was starting to strain the buttons of
her shirt! \
\
\"EEP!\" She squealed yet again as the inevitable happened: one of the
buttons flew off and across from her, landing near a pedestrian who just
stared in awe as her bust became fuller and fuller within her top. This
only humiliated her more, and she could feel her bra straining to keep
her head sized breasts contained. Then her nipples joined in. The poked
out angrily, and their sensitivity spiked. Another button busted off,
and a sudden brush of dress pulled over her fabric clad nubs.\
\
A rush of pleasure flowed over her. This filled her with adrenaline,
which finally snapped her out of her dazed state. She began to run home.
Closing her eyes and flailing her hands up in the air, she ran as fast
as she could with such exaggerated proportions.\
\
\'Ohmygoshohmygosh\' Her thoughts were screaming at her. Her boobs were
huge and her butt had been exposed\...and now that she thought of
it\...\
\
She stopped for a moment and took a look down, catching her breath. She
was now in a small suburb, not far from home. But the horror of her
situation caught up with her. The fabric of her dress had ridden up and
up, needing more material to cover her boobs that her butt became
unattended. The very bottom of the hem had risen just above the edge of
her cheeks, a small pink triangle of her panties now exposed.\
\
Nissa looked back forward, then down, assessing the damage done to her
breasts. She nearly fainted. A large rip was forming over her rapidly
swelling front. She had already passed Sakura in size and was visibly
growing larger by the second. She could feel her skirt rising over her
cheeks, the air kissing more and more of her thighs and rump.\
\
"Please just STOOOOOOP\" She pleaded, pounding her bosom with her fists.
She only achieved in making herself orgasm from the harsh impacts on her
increasing bosom. She almost collapsed upon the street, the feelings so
intense that the breath was stolen from her for a moment. Slowly, she
began moving again, hefting her giant bosom and megaton booty home as
fast as she could, hoping no one else would see her.\
\
\"Why is this happening?\" Nissa muttered to herself as she made her way
to her doorstop. Tears were forming in her eyes and she wiped them away
as she got out her key. She looked down to her keyhole and saw nothing
but boobs. Her entire lower vision was taken up by the immense line of
cleavage she now sported. Another button flew off with a \"PING!\" Only
one held the jacket together. After that, she would be exposed. She
quickly pulled the door open and rushed inside her home.\
\
Shoving her over 3 foot wide bosom made her fall forward form the
sensations, making her fall on top of her boobs. Her scream of intense
pleasure rattled throughout the apartment.\
\
\"Holy dogshit, what was that!?\" Mano wobbled out of her room. She
paused as she saw to massive flesh pillows pushing Nissa up, who was
uncovered on her rump, which stuck out over a foot and a half above her.
Mano stared at this scene for a moment, letting it sink in. Her J-cups
still weighed heavily upon her, but even this couldn\'t take away from
the sheer incredulousness of the scene before her. Slowly, but surely,
she began to let out a long, loud cackle, pointing at the still growing
form of Nissa.\
\
\"Oh my fucking God! Look at you! You\'re bigger than Kura and me
COMBINED!\" She laughed hard, her breasts wobbling and jostling inside
her tight red t-shirt. She had to sit down, resting on the armchair
nearby as she continued to laugh, clutching her stomach as she did so. \
\
Nissa blushed even more atop her sensitive tits, making her bust pick up
the pace again in growth. Bigger and bigger she swelled up, pushing her
upper body upwards higher and higher. Eventually, her dress gave up and
her top completely ripped apart, leaving her naked from the waist up and
in only her panties.\
\
Mano got up with her smart phone and took several photos. This only
fueled the fire. her growth picked up ten fold, now visibly growing at
least a centimeter a second. She lifted her head and looked over at
Mano. \
\
\"Manooooo\...please\...stoooop\...call Kura and help her fix
meeeeee\...\" Nissa whined, flailing atop her now body sized breasts,
completely sprawled out across them as she rose off the ground.\
\
\"No WAY! I ain\'t gonna ruin the fun by calling in that old fogie. Keep
going Niss! I wanna see your ass squish into the ceiling!\" Mano
taunted, still taking photos as Nissa scaled up and up with her growth,
no end seemingly in sight.\
\
\"Just WHAT Is happening in HERE!?\" A stern British accent erupted out.
Mano fell over from her jump as Tiffany stomped forwards towards the
helplessly swelling Nissa.\
\
\"I CAN ONLY DEAL WITH ONE MESS AT A TIME MANO!\"\
\
\"I DIDNT DO ANYTHING, BITCH!\"\
\
\"Alright, alright\...just\...calm down. I\'ve got all hell breaking
loose back at the shop, so let\'s just make this one quick, shall we?\"
She took her finger and prodded it into the side of Nissa\'s breast
making her gasp suddenly. The touch made her have a sudden growth spurt,
filling out further across the floor, one side of her breast beginning
to push against the wall. \"Ahh, so its THAT one, is it?\" Tiffany
sighed. \"Some residue may be left due to the over-exposure, but you
will certainly be able to WALK again, at the very least.\" She snapped
her fingers, a pink smoke cloud puffing across Nissa\'s body, causing
the growth to suddenly halt.\
\
\"Now if you don\'t mind, I\'ve got spirits to wrangle back at the
shop\...God forbid if Autumn doesn\'t bring a million little pranksters
to shoot into all of our tits\...\" She wobbled to the side, small
circle-shaped lights shining through her skin, and her bright red
corset. Tiffany scrunched up her nose and looked down. Her tits wobbled
about in her clothing, the little lights moving back and forth across
her bust. She adjusted her corset, hoping to settle them down. Stifling
a giggle, the tickling getting to be a bit much for her liking. "Calm
down you little\..." She muttered to her chest.\
\
Mano held back a snicker. \"Funny eh? Let\'s see how YOU like them, mega
jugs\" She walked up to Mano and pressed her tits into hers. Mano felt a
sudden jolt, like getting shocked by static electricity, as the spirits
transferred over to her.\
\
\"Wh-WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME?!\" Mano yelled in outrage. Tiffany just
smiled and chuckled. \
\
\"A little spirit transfer. Enjoy them dearie.\"\
\
\"But-but what do they do?\" Mano asked, pouting, gripping her breasts
tightly as they glowed.\
\
\"Not much. But they\'ll be a hell of a nuisance until I can get Autumn
to get them out.\" She winked, then poofed into thin air.\
\
Nissa waved the smoke away in time to see Mano arch up on her feet and
gasp.\
\
\"OH MY GOD! WHAT ARE THEY DOING!?\" She shrieked, pulling her hands
away form her light filled boobs as her nips poked through the fabric.
Her breasts bobbled to and fro, threatening to pull her down with just
their weight alone.\
\
\"GET OUT YOU LITTLE BASTARDS!!!\"\
\
Nissa managed to chuckle, adjusting to a kneeling position. She had her
arms corralling her newly grow melons, hiding her modestly as best as
she could. She was still slightly saddened she had even more to deal
with now.\
\
\"If you behave Mano, I can walk you to the shop and Tiffany\'s friend
can get those spirit things out\" Mano shot Nissa a look of annoyance,
but sighed.\
\
\"Whatever\...but you gotta throw on a shirt\...or something that can
fit, hehe\...\" Poking fun at Nissa\'s new basketball sized bosom, she
made her way to her room to get dressed, leaving Nissa to do the same.
Nissa took another look down at herself and frowned. She squeezed her
arms together, watching the flesh squish together and eat up the sides
of her arms.\
\
\"Ohhh\...why me?\" Nissa muttered before going in her room to find
something to wear. Digging through her closet, she couldn\'t find a
thing, until a thought occurred\...Sakura wouldn\'t mind if she borrowed
a shirt of hers, would she? Nissa bobbled her big booty into Sakura\'s
room and opened her closet. She picked the most covering T shirt, which
was bowed out even on the hanger.\
\
\"She really is huge up top\" Nissa muttered, slipping the shirt on. It
was slim in fit but not snug on her. Nissa smiled and exited the room.
\"Ready Mano?\" Mano grunted, wearing a black long-sleeved shirt, trying
her best to keep her glowing bust hidden as it wobbled about
involuntarily.\
\
\"As ready as I\'ll ever be, I guess\...let\'s just get this over
with\...\" The two made their way out the door and towards Tiffany\'s
shop.\
\
The walk was very embarrassing. Nissa nearly moaned each time her boobs
bounced into her. They were so energetic she almost considered hugging
them to keep them in check.\
\
Mano was only making it worse, changing from grabbing her boobs to
suddenly letting go and having them bounce around on their own accord.
The faintest of light could still be seen though Mano\'s top, and Mano
made sure to vocalize when her spirits had found her nipples.\
\
The short walk ended with them at the shop door. Already they could hear
shouting and squeals. The sign read \'Closed\'. Nissa tentatively opened
the door, peeking into the room beyond it.\
\
\"Hello-WAH!\" A small orb whizzed by her face, landing over by Tiffany,
who caught it in midair and held it floating with some invisible force.\
\
\"Alright, catch Sakura!\" She tossed it over to Sakura, who held her
chest out. The spirit zoomed in and landed, absorbing into her titflesh.
Nissa looked over at Autumn and her jaw nearly dropped. Autumn had gone
from flat chested to torpedo boobs in no time at all! They were almost
as large as Mano\'s!\
\
\"What\'s going on in here?\" Mano shouted, barging in the door.
\"Someone better explain to me why I have ticklers in my tits!\" Mano
went almost unnoticed as everyone was busy going for the stray balls of
light flying about. A pair dive bombed Tiffany and absorbed into her
boobs, making her grunt in annoyance as she was tickled even more.
Autumn was busy groping herself, obviously just as plagued by the
spirits as her top glowed with many spots of light beneath the fabric.\
\
Sakura was almost like two spot lights. He medicine balls were glowing
brightly, and one could just make out the constant shifting of tiny
lights under her skin. She was crying with laughter but was managing to
keep her head as she scooped up a lone spirit into her boob.\
\
\"ENOUGH!\" Tiffany bellowed as she twisted her hands in a furious
incantation. \"I may not be the commander of spirits..\" The spirits
within the room began collecting out of her, Autumn and Mano\'s bosom
and above her waving hands. \"\...but I sure as hell know how to take
charge!\" With a flick of her wrists, the large mass of spirits shot
into Sakura\'s bosom, her breasts shining as bright as a solar lamp.
\"NOW AUTUMN!\"\
\
\"Right!\" Autumn did some magic of her own, pulling out a purple stone
from her pocket and lifting it up, and to the sides, muttering strange
words as she did so. Nissa merely looked on in awe. A large flash of
purple light and a sudden cracking noise.\
\
That\'s all that happened before the room went quiet. A light haze of
excess energy hung in the air. \
\
Autumn was looking dejected, her purple stone was in pieces.\
\
Nissa turned to the large light sources on the ground.\
\
Sakura was on all fours,  fingers clenched as she pushed her radiant
rack into the floor, gasping, giggling, moaning, trying to find relief,
to no avail.\
\
\"They all rejected the vessel stone?\" Autumn muttered.\
\
\"Well, now what, Miss Spirit?\" Tiffany asked, still irritated.\
\
\"Well, since they rejected that\...they\'ll likely settle within her
breasts\...and calm in time. At least I hope so\...\" Autumn looked
worried. Nissa could read from her face that she felt terrible. Was she
the one that caused all this in the first place? She was the very same
person that caused Sakura to have milk makers in the first place\...
\"I\'m really Sorry Sakura, I didn\'t mean for you to be the victim
again\" Autumn apologized, kneeling down to touch Sakura\'s shoulder.\
\
A jolt of purple electricity ran up Sakura\'s arm and hit Autumn square
in her bowling ball mams. Almost immediately, purple lights began
showing under her skin and robe. \"AHH!\" Autumn yelled a high pitch
scream as she was thrust back, her boobs shaking and quaking violently
as purple light shot through it and glowed brightly. \"OH NO! NOT
THIS!\" Autumn knew full well what was going to happen. And she had to
brace for it\...\
\
The glow intensified and narrowed its field until only her very hard and
plump nips glowed as bright as Sakura\'s tits. All the girls jumped when
a shower of excess energy shot forth, dousing them in the haze of
spiritual power. \
\
Autumn ended her scream and sank to her knees, squeezing her bust with
her upper arms and breathing hard. A moment passed, then a little poke
alerted her attention downwards.\
\
Five purple spirit lights danced around in each of her breasts, sparking
pleasant prickles where they glided. Mano simply looked on, stupefied.\
\
\"What the hell are you all IN to?\"

CH 8: Trading Places

Winter had arrived. A mix of rain and snow now fell from the sky and
into the streets in front of Tiffany\'s Shop of Oddities. The shop
usually became a lot less busy around these times, right after the
holidays. Tiffany knew this, and also knew that people would likely not
be dropping by as much on New Year\'s Eve. With this knowledge in mind,
she had left the shop to her busty assistant Sakura, trusting her enough
at this point to keep track of the place herself\...somewhat.\
\
"Keep an eye on her, ok? Make sure nothing\...unsavory occurs." Tiffany
commanded the small sock puppet named Whit, who saluted her orders
accordingly.\
\
"Yes ma\'am!" Tiffany chuckled at his enthusiasm.\
\
"Good man. I\'ll be back tomorrow, alright? Make sure you tell Kura
where we keep the air mattresses." And with that, Tiffany tossed a scarf
across her neck, then vanished, leaving the shop in silence. Whit then
floated over to the front area of the shop. A table with a few armchairs
adorned its space near the counter, with two bombshells sitting at it:
Nissa and Sakura.\
\
The coffee table had a pile of several large text books piled up towards
Nissa\'s end. Nissa herself was dressed in a comfy warm keyhole sweater
that managed to keep her lower half moderately contained. She sat very
high up atop of her enormous backside, almost as much as a kneeling
person.\
\
On the other side of the book pile rested Sakura\'s very large and
glowing bosom. Its soft hugeness dominated her front as it fought to
escape from her very tight long sleeve V neck.\
\
Whit made a sly sock grin and prepared to dive.\
\
Just as he flew down, he was suddenly stopped by some invisible force.\
\
"Wha?!" He shouted in confusion. This caught the attention of the two
ladies, looking up at the source of the sound. Both of them smiled.
Nissa then gasped, realizing what was going on.\
\
"Ooh! I\'m so sorry Whit!" She closed her eyes for a moment before Whit
could feel the strange invisible wall vanish. After it did, he made a
slow, cautious descent down to the two busty babes. \
\
"Er\...what is\...all this\...?" Whit looked over the books skeptically.
"Are you two\...learning boobie magic like Crimson?" This made Sakura
giggle.\
\
"No, nonono! We\'re learning other stuff. Tiff owns other kinds of magic
books, y\'know!" Whit let out a \'hmph\' and crossed his arms.\
\
"Well of COURSE I know that! Now then\...what\...exactly are you two
learning then\...?"\
\
\"I\'m learning moving magic and such! Or\....telekinetic
manipulation\...\" Nissa pulled up one of the books and read the old
worn leather cover. \"I\'m really liking it! Its really easy to do!\"\
\
Before anyone could say anything else, Sakura suddenly shrieked and
disappeared thru the floor. A few moments passed until she eventually
hovered back up onto her seat, her arms crossed under her enormous
medicine ball-sized bosom, a pout on her face.\
\
"Not FUNNY you guys!" Her bosom quivered as a faint sound of laughter
could be heard within it. She sighed. "I\'m just learning how to get
these things under control. They can really be a handful at times\..."
Sakura mused as she poked one of her tits, watching them glow and wobble
in place. Suddenly Sakura began to slowly rise upwards, her glowing
pillows leading the way.\
\
\"Not Again! STOP!" Sakura shouted at the many glowing orbs within her
breasts. More laughter sounded as she was pulled higher, like she was in
zero gravity. Her flailing only served to make her slowly spin out of
control.\
\
\"Does this\...happen often?\" Nissa shook her head at Whit\'s
question.\
\
"Only when she\'s trying to train or control them. Usually they just
kinda make her fill with milk all the time or make her really bouncy."
Nissa looked up, concerned for her friend, but at the same time, she
couldn\'t help but giggle as Kura flailed around, cursing at her
spirit-filled bosom. As she awaited her friend to gain control, she
looked through a book, finding a spell she wanted to try out. Reading it
through, she looked over at the coffee mug she left on the other side of
the table. She paused, looking over at it and concentrating hard,
pushing her peach hair from out of her face. Suddenly, the mug vanished,
then reappeared in front of her hand. "YES! I did it!" She jumped a bit
in place and pumped her arms, feeling her jugs wobble in place, blushing
a bit at the familiar feeling. After they had settled, she lifted the
cup to her face, only to see it was empty.\
\
Nissa looked back over to see the end of the table covered in her hot
cocoa, dripping to the floor.\
\
"Oh! Goodness, I need to clean that up. I\'ll be right back Kura!" She
stood and dashed off to a different section of the store to pick up some
towels, wobbling in many different areas along the way.\
\
\"OOOH DO NOT MENTION MILK!\" Sakura squealed. She brought her hands to
her bosom and began to moan and shake. A loud gurgling could be heard
from her breasts as they glowed with a soft pink color. The got rounder
and tighter in a few seconds, then quieted down and resumed bouncing on
their own.\
\
\"OOPS!! I-I\'m Sorry Kura! I forgot they are starting to react to
words!\" Sakura panted as she was slowly brought back down to her chair,
her boobs now nice and perky, nips at attention, but not quite full
enough to need to be milked. \
\
"Its\...its fine Niss, no real\...damage done." She let out a weak laugh
as Nissa apologized once again before running off to find something to
clean the cocoa mess. Sakura sat there for a moment, collecting herself,
before she heard a jingle nearby. The front door. They finally had a
customer today!\
\
\"Of course I\'m 10 gallons heavier\...\" As Sakura moved to get up, she
struggled with the new milky weight in her lap. She peered around the
book case to see a young couple in their late teens eying the shop with
surprised looks.\
\
\"Ok girls, lets put on the charm now\...\"\
\
The taut bosom in her shirt shuddered to a stand still. Her whole body
started to lightly glow. Her shirt suddenly tightened and her neckline
opened more. Her butt got a bit more bubble to it. Her breasts puffed up
just a bit more, and even rose a few inches more than normal so they hid
Sakura\'s neck and shoulders when seen from the front.\
\
Whit simply gawked at the small transformation.\
\
\"One of the few things I managed to teach them. Its like they only care
about how I look\...\" Sakura snidely remarked as she turned in front of
a body mirror and inspected her overall look. She winced as she felt her
shirt rubbing over her still erect nips, where she felt the spirits
pinning them with energy just to bother her. She rolled her eyes and
decided it was good enough.\
\
\"Okay Whit, go hide now, but let Nissa know we have company.\"\
\
"Gotcha!" And with that, Whit flew where Nissa ran off to. Sakura
watched as the couple entered further into the shop, looking around at
the various items on the shelves, and in the cases. She slowly made her
way over, pacing herself behind them to wait for the perfect moment to
"strike". When the guy picked up a silver necklace with an emerald
heart, she took her chance, stepping forward and presenting herself.\
\
She stumbled a bit as she made her way towards them, but not nearly as
bad as she had in previous encounters. Needless to say, she got their
attention nearly right away. Her bust bounced much more than usual,
following natural motions in reaction to her movements. The spirits were
making sure she jiggled much more and far longer than her normal busty
physics allowed.\
\
The pair just stared in shock. A glint of envy was seen in the face of
the girl, and the guy was just in total bliss watching the huge boobs
bound their way closer and closer.\
\
Sakura stopped with her chest half a foot away form each of them. She
crossed her arms under them and slightly cocked her hip to the left.
Even tho she was right in front of them both their heads were craned
downwards at her tight, plush cleavage bursting forth from her top.\
\
\"Eh-hem\" She cleared her throat a few moments later.\
\
"Oh uh-" Both of the customers nervously and embarrassingly glanced up,
then to the side, the man coughing a bit, the girl fanning herself a bit
with her hand for a moment. Sakura refrained from giggling, and tried to
change the subject.\
\
"So I see you have your eyes on one of my products?" Sakura did her best
to emulate Tiffany, whilst still adding her own style to it. They both
looked at the charm, then back over to Kura, nodding hesitantly. "See,
that\'s a fun one. What EXACTLY are you two looking for here?"\
\
\"Well\" Started the girl,\"\...I heard\...From a friend\...whose
friend\...bought something from\...here\...and\....\" She trailed off as
her hands made exaggerations around her chest and hips.\
\
The guy piped up.\
\
\"She\'s looking for that same\...\*oomph\*\" The female compatriot
tried to hide her beat red face as she agreed.\
\
Sakura smiled softly, trying to ease the tension in the air.\
\
\"Well you have come to the right shop my friends.\"\
\
Meanwhile, Nissa wiped up the cocoa from the table, doing her best to
clean the mess she had made. Her skirt stretched and groaned as she bent
over, putting as much elbow grease as she could into cleaning the
surface.\
\
"You know, you don\'t have to rub the paint off the table, right Peach?"
Nissa jumped, almost forgetting that Whit was even there. She nodded,
picking up the sopping wet paper towels and tossing them in the
garbage.\
\
"R-right\...hopefully it doesn\'t stain\..."\
\
"Its brown cocoa on a brown wood table, Peach, I\'m sure its fine." Whit
assured her, floating gently nearby. "Now\...can I ask why exactly
you\'re messing with magic like that?" he gestured over to the books
still piled on the other side of the table.\
\
\"Tiffany says I have an affinity for it\" Nissa said as she brought 2
fingers to her temple. A moment later one of the books began to rise and
floated to her open arm resting in the crook of her narrow waist and the
immense swell of her hip. \"See?\"\
\
Whit simply nodded, having watched with interest.\
\
\"Sakura and Tiffany says its best that we pick up on some sort of magic
to help us, since over the last years we have\....grown\...quite a bit.
Sakura can get her spirits to work like telekinesis, they just sometimes
like to act like brats\" Nissa chuckled as she moved away from the
voices, her huge butt bobbling with her sway.\
\
The voices nearby, however, were concerned with making a sale. Well, one
of them were, at least.\
\
"So\..." Sakura thought to herself as she convinced the couple of their
decision. "The actual price of this particular item is around\...\$40,
but\...you two seem sweet, and in need\..." Sakura casually glanced at
the girl\'s petite figure, who blushed and looked away nervously. Sakura
smiled at this warmly. "I\'m thinking \$25? Deal?" The couple looked at
one another, then nodded vigorously. "Excellent! Let\'s get you rung
up!"\
\
\'Slosh, slosh, slosh\...\'\
\
\"\...do you hear that?\" Asked the guy.\
\
\"It sounds like water moving in a balloon or something\...\" replied
his girlfriend.\
\
\"Hmm\...I don\'t hear anything\...\" Sakura pretended to be
inquisitive, but oblivious, to the sounds of her milk sloshing about.
\'Little bastards\' she thought as she rounded the counter and slid her
boobs atop the surface for greater effect.\
\
The bell jingled again. Another customer!\
\
"Hellooooooooooo juggies!" Sakura immediately sulked as Nissa cringed at
the sound of the voice. They both knew exactly what they were in for. As
Kura finished helping out her customers, they shuffled out and away from
the new intruder.\
\
"Ugh\...Mano, what are you doing here?!" Sakura complained as she
rounded the corner of the counter to accost her unwelcome roommate. Mano
chuckled, pulling on her back a bit as her J-cup jugs swayed in place,
rocking on her heels in an innocent sort of manner.\
\
\"What? I can\'t visit my breast friends at work?\" Mano smiled as she
ran her just slightly smaller bust into her room mates own rack. \"Oh
No! Have you been growing again?\" Mano took the opportunity to glomp
onto Sakura and fondle her heavy assets, making her jiggle and slosh.
The spirits liked Mano\'s touch for some reason, one that Sakura herself
couldn\'t figure out. After the unwelcome embrace, Sakura pushed her
handsy friend away.\
\
"Do you REALLY have to do this while I\'m at work, Mano?" Sakura hissed,
giving her friend a stern glare. Mano shrugged, a comical smirk across
her face.\
\
"I dunno. Its fun to me." Mano laughed and walked towards Nissa, who
tried her best to be hospitable towards Mano. "Hey there bubble butt,
what\'s happenin\'?" Nissa squirmed at the nickname, grasping at one of
her wide hips. Meanwhile, the front door jingled, more customers
entering.\
\
"Ugh, just\...behave yourself while you\'re here Mano!" Sakura yelled
after her friend as she made her way towards the new customers.\
\
\" Yokai!\" Mano agreed in Japanese. She turned to the sock floating
above Nissa.\
\
\"Hey socky, what kind of knick knacks do you have around here that
might help me with-\" She gave a sensual moan and pressed her upper arms
into her basketballs in her light sweater. \"- these hmmmmm?\"\
\
Whit just stared at the inviting cleavage, much like Mowgli hypnotized
by Kaa.\
\
Nissa, unnerved by Mano\'s outburst, had a sudden spike of energy
herself. It spiked, sending a strange blast upwards and onto the shelf.
This caused a product to fall forwards, landing in Mano\'s cleavage.\
\
"WAA!" Mano flinched and expected the worst, but when nothing followed,
she investigated, pulling the object from her lady bumpers. She brought
it up to her face, reading off the product. "Itch & Grow\...by Tiff
Industries\..." She rolled her eyes at the name, but soon, her frown
turned into a devilish smile. "Lucky for me it was still sealed
up\...but not for long\..." She pulled open the cap and peeled off the
protective plastic, sealing the cap back on the bottle carefully. \
\
"Mano\...what\'re you\...?" \
\
"Shh, its nothing junk trunk, I\'m just gonna put this where more people
can find it\...that\'s all\..." Nissa\'s naivety betrayed her, taking
the red head\'s word for it, smiling and nodding. \
\
"Ohh, ok. Be careful while you\'re back there though, a lot of those
things can be kinda dangerous!" \
\
Mano paid her no heed as she b lined for the front of the store. She
spotted her blue hair friend sticking her chest out for a female
customer, making as good of an impression for her as she could.\
\
Mano watched as Sakura left the customer to think for a bit. The
devilish grin only got bigger on Mano\'s face as she sneaked along the
shelves to see Sakura looking for something. The blue haired babe\'s
enormous front bumped into a stack of chess pieces that all clattered
down onto the floor.\
\
"Shit!" Sakura muttered as she bent over to pick them all up.\
\
\'Now\'s my chance!\' Mano thought as she stepped over to her. She slyly
hid underneath the table, watching as Sakura\'s ass pushed forward, her
jeans opening slightly, her shirt rising to show her blue cotton panties
to the world. \'And here we\...go\...\' With that brief opening, Mano
speckled some of the powder down the opening. After she was satisfied
with the small amount, she set the bottle silently on the table and
resumed her silent hiding.\
\
Sakura, meanwhile, subconsciously patted her behind, the slight feeling
as if something was off in her mind. She shrugged it off and continued
to assist the couple.\
\
"Sooo\...what are we looking for today?" Sakura asked, clasping her
hands together expectantly. The customer observed Sakura for a moment,
noting her wide hips as they waggled slightly. \
\
"Well\..." This customer seemed to be a bit less nervous about what they
wanted, rubbing their hip as they looked back up at Sakura. "I\'m
already satisfied with my bust line\..." The woman indeed sported a
healthy pair of E-cups, at least from what Sakura could tell. It only
made sense that she might want something on her lower end a bit more.\
\
"Ahh, so you want to\...balance yourself out, as it were?" The woman
nodded to Sakura\'s suggestion. Sakura fidgeted a bit in place. \"I have
a select few items that can help you with that. Wait one moment
please.\"\
\
Sakura bounced off around the corner to the shelves. Suddenly she gasped
and hunched over as the entirety of her behind was plagued by one of the
worst itches she had ever experienced, or at least could ever remember
having.\
\
\"Oh Gooooooooooooooood\" She hissed as she attempted to alleviate her
problem by scratching. Her jeans were proving to be a bigger hindrance,
so she slipped her hands underneath them and drew long heaping handfuls
of her posterior. As she scratched, each draw was like heaven, making
the itch ebb away more and more with every stroke of her fingers.\
\
After a minute or two, the itching disappeared almost completely. She
picked out the items, and walked back, hearing a faint creak behind her.
She ignored it, focusing on making the sale as well as she could. She
stepped back over to the customer who, immediately upon seeing her,
almost gasped, but seemed to hold it back. Her eyes darted from Kura\'s
hips, back to her, then her hips, back to her face. "Right, so\...this
one\..." Sakura held up a small metal orb, with a button affixed to its
top. "\...you press the button, and\..." As she delved into her
explanation, she could feel the familiar itching sensation crawling back
into her posterior. She bit her lip, stifling her gasps, then continued
her selling pitch.\
\
\"Hold it\...uuuuuntil\...you\'re sat-Oh!\...satisfied with the
resuuuuults\" Sakura was on the verge of sweating. The itch was back in
full swing, begging her to scratch her bottom. She swiveled her hips,
her spine had chills running up and down it as she moved her shoulders
about.\
\
Her pants were feeling very tight. She wasn\'t sure if it was spirit
issues or not, but she could feel the front pulling into her tum a bit
harsher. She handed the sphere to the customer. And while she looked the
orb over, Sakura made a big dive to itch her bum. A few moments was all
she needed before the customer returned with a question about the other
items.\
\
\"This one is a new item. Its a sweat band that converts physical
exertion into\...uh\...well, you um\...you exercise and you get buns.\"
The woman raised an eyebrow at Sakura\'s explanation.\
\
"So\...instead of losing weight, I get a bigger ass instead?" Sakura
nodded, waving a finger.\
\
"Not just ass: hips and thighs too, but keeping a thin waist. Its a bit
slower but it makes it a bit more precise than the orb." Once again, the
itch returned, Sakura groaning silently and rolling her eyes to herself.
\'God, what has gotten INTO me lately? Did Mano buy, like, a different
laundry detergent or something?\' The customer looked over the two
objects presented to her. As she did, Sakura slowly backed up to the
table behind her, Mano close by underneath it, trying to keep her
riotous laughter to herself.\
\
"Oh my GOD she\'s puffing up soooo much, haha!" Sakura backed up closer,
finally hitting the edge of the table with her buns, then moving up and
down subtly, hoping to get the itch she couldn\'t scratch in front of
her customer. As she did, the bottle set haphazardly by Mano on the
table began to wobble and teeter, dangerously close to Sakura\'s
backside.\
\
Sakura gave a big push as the table edge pushed into the soft ripe
backside. The bottle fell over, the small lip hooking on the pushed away
band of Sakuras jeans, dumping its contents down her underwear as she
grinded her hips and butt against it. Up, down, swaying left and right,
she worked her butt and cured herself of the itch. \
\
As she found relief, she heard threads snapping behind her.\
\
"What was tha-OH GOD!" her hands flew to her mouth, hoping she had not
gotten the attention of the customer. Unfortunately, all she saw when
she looked over was a woman staring back at her, one eyebrow cocked.
"Uhh\...so how about it?" The customer looked down at Sakura, and
noticed that her jeans were busting by the seams. Bubbles of flesh
pushed out from the sides, her wide hips taking charge and putting her
clothes to the test. Her hips were rivaling her shoulders in width,
although that didn\'t say much, since her tits beat her shoulders in
width anyways. Still, it was rather impressive, and somehow convinced
the woman to come to a decision, with a smirk.\
\
"I\'ll take \'em both. You seem to know how these work, and it looks
like you\...indulge in it too, I guess?" Sakura blushed and waved her
hands in front of her defensively. \
\
"No, nonono, this is just\...I don\'t really\..." But when she saw the
customer\'s quizzical face once again, her stance changed. She cleared
her throat and continued. "I mean\...yes, yep. I\..." She sighed and
rubbed her forehead. "\...I enjoy blowing myself up like this on
occasion. Its\...its\...fun."\
\
"Oh is it now\...?" Mano muttered from underneath the table, the huge
grin on her face getting broader. "I\'ll keep that in mind\..." She
watched as Sakura and her now convinced customer sashayed away to the
front of the store, likely to go to check out. "\...wonder how \'bigger
butt\' is doing\...?" Mano snickered at her nickname for Nissa as she
slowly crawled her way back towards the front of the store.\
\
\"And this\...\" Nissa chirped happily as she levitated several objects
around her like an unsteady set of planets orbiting two suns. "\...is
what I can do now. But Tiff told me that if I train hard enough, I can
eventually teleport! And to far away places to, like from here to home,
or even further!"\
\
Whit was enamored with Nissa\'s skill. Tiffany didn\'t show much of her
other magic, at least in front of him, anyways.\
\
\"So cool!\" Whit said in awe. Nissa nodded proudly and slowly let the
objects down, putting them back in their respective places. Meanwhile,
Sakura hurriedly walked her way back to the front, her hips swaying
heavily from side to side with the new, unfamiliar girth. She wanted to
get this sale done as soon as possible before\...\
\
"Oh no\..." She could feel it coming back, and strong\...whatever was
causing this to happen to her ass, she was NOT ok with it. "This better
be temporary, or I swear\..." As she came through, customer in tow, she
felt her hip bump against the shelf near the reading area. She paid no
mind, laser-focused on the task at hand. However, the shelf swayed every
so slightly, sending a ceramic bottle toppling downwards towards the two
people below.\
\
Luckily, it had a soft landing.\
\
Unfortunately for Nissa, her cleavage was that landing. The bottle had
landed, bottom\'s up, right between her jugs, only to illicit a sudden
silence from the peach-haired girl, her wide-eyed surprised expression
almost made Whit let out an "awww\..."\
\
"EEEEEEP!" Nissa yelped, her delicate hands wrapping around the surface
of the bottle. "Ooh\...what is this? Whit? Whit what is this bottle?"
Whit hovered over and flipped himself upside down to read the label. \
\
"Hmm\...standard growth serum. Topical based. Potent results. Permanent
unless pre-mixed with a  catalyst. Hehe, we don\'t even sell that
ingredient here\..."\
\
"Whiiiiit!" Nissa wiggled in her seat, fearful of the words he had just
uttered. "Is this\...am I\...what do I do?"\
\
"Oh! Um, the bottle should be nice and sealed, since its a liquid and
all, so don\'t worry about getting it on you. You\'re fine." He
reassured her with his usual string-sewn grin. Nissa relaxed and let out
a sigh, gripping the bottle with one hand. \
\
"Oh thank goodness\...I thought that was going to be really, really bad
for a second\..." As she tugged at the bottle, she noticed that it was
somewhat stuck. She hadn\'t noticed before, but she had packed her
cleavage extra tight into her sweater. She still hadn\'t gotten used to
her new size, even if it had been a couple of months since she had had
that growth spurt\...\
\
She tugged again, tentatively pulling upwards with more and more vigor,
until, finally, the bottle came out with a \'pop!\'\
\
Much to Nissa\'s surprise, and terror, the suction of her squeezed tits
had pulled the cork out of the bottle. Nissa sat there with the bottle
tipped upside-down, pouring the liquid all across her exposed boobs. As
soon as she had registered what was going on, she let out a high pitch
squeal, tossing the bottle away from her. What was supposed to be a
light, gentle toss resulted in a high-velocity, telekenisis-fueled
thrust through the air, the bottle smashing against the wall.\
\
The liquid was a faint blue and spread out over the fast slopes of her
bust, soaking just a bit into the neckline of her sweater. Nissa held
her breathe, waiting for something to happen. a tingle, a feeling of
tightness, something. Whit just floated there, hyper alert to her bosom.
His favorite pass time, aside from hiding in Sakura\'s canyon cleavage,
was watching boobs grow.\
\
\"M-maybe\.....it expired?\" Nissa pipped up, hoping that she was
right.\
\
\"I dunno\.....her stuff is easily 400 years old in here and it all
still works\...\...but you could be right." Nissa lowered her arms and
tentativly touched her chest pillows. She furthered her examination of
her frontage until she was satisfied that nothing was happening.\
\
\"That was a BIG scare!\" Nissa said, breathing a sign of relief. \
\
\"Aww..\" Whit sighed as he wasn\'t going to get to see any growing
boobs now. Nissa bent over and picked up what pieces of the bottle, but
soon realized she could simply use her telekinesis instead of fighting
her front and her knees.\
\
\"I hope it wasn\'t too expensive though\....Tiffany isn\'t going to be
ha-\"\
\
It happened in an instant. A prickle caught in her nipples, and soon
spread across the entirety of her breasts. It raged into her torso and
soon was running along her limbs. She was still in the middle of gasping
when the wave reached her toes and fingers and reversed upon itself,
racing back to her breasts.\
\
As soon as it reached her nipples again, they harshly poked through the
fabric of her sweater. Her telekinetic energy shot forth, disheveling
several items off the opposing book case. She arched her back.\
\
Finally in one meaty thrust, her breasts leapt forward a couple inches
into her sweater, pulling it higher as more volume demanded more
coverage.\
\
In the span of half a second it all happened. She fell to her knees, her
breasts bobbled, and she orgasmed hard. So hard, she shook the book case
with her mind. After a few seconds, she collected herself, her eyes
opening up gently, not before widening as soon as she saw her new tits.
It wasn\'t a drastic change, but it was one that Nissa noticed
nonetheless. \
\
"Ah\...uh\..." She was speechless. She brought a hesitant finger towards
one of her boobs and pressed gently. The springy flesh gave just a bit
before pressing back out against her fingertip. "Wh\...wh\...WHIT!"
Nissa turned abruptly to face the sock puppet, her face a bright shade
of red. Whit smiled, seeing that whatever was in the bottle had taken
effect. He hid that smile however, trying his best to be surprised along
with Nissa.\
\
"Uh\...oh, goodness!" He floated over, his eyes not leaving the strained
sweater, her cleavage window being pulled to either side by the new
expanse of flesh. "Looks like it was effective after all. Well,
hopefully, that was\..." His words drifted as he watched Nissa\'s tits.
They quivered and shook, seemingly on their own. He looked back up to
see Nissa, a look of shock and anxiety plastered across her face.\
\
"They\'re\...they\'re not done yet?"\
\
Meanwhile, Sakura rushed to the front counter, her ass practically
screaming to be itched. The seams were bursting. Flesh bubbled out from
the holes. Every second the intense desire to scratch every square inch
of booty grew stronger and stronger. She pushed the thoughts as far as
she could out of mind to tend to the till.\
\
"Yes, ok, so that\'ll\...that\'ll be \$22.50\..." The customer nodded
and began rummaging through her purse. All Sakura could do was wait
patiently, her ass subconsciously waggling behind her as every second
felt like an eternity. Sakura fidgeted back and forth, She was desperate
to itch her tush. It was clawing at all her subconscious. She had to put
all her energy into focusing on the transaction.\
\
Then she heard it. A new rip. A different rip. She stole a peak at her
butt and saw the seam over the crease of her ass had formed a teniss
ball sized hole. Flesh oozed from the opening with her panties peeking
out. What\'s worse was that it was slowing popping. Like a zipper being
unzipped extremely slowly. \
\
Almost like a count down. \
\
\"Whiiiiiiit, what do I do, what do I do?!\" Nissa whined, flailing her
arms as her bigger breasts wobbled and jiggled about. Whit tapped his
head with his arm-nub, pretending to think aloud. He shrugged.\
\
"I think we just gotta wait it out, since the cure isn\'t in the
store."\
\
"Ooooh, but I don\'t wanna wait it oUUUUH!" Nissa squeaked loudly as the
feeling erupted through her once again. Like a boomerang it rocketed
through her whole body before the pleasure centered right back to her
tits, causing them to puff up another two inches. Her sweater creaked
and groaned in protest, the window showing her cleavage now ripping at
the corners. Nissa\'s breasts had almost caught up to Sakura\'s medicine
balls, and she still felt the tingle resonating throughout them.
"AAHHHH! They\'re getting too BIG!" Nissa clamped her hands down on her
luscious growing orbs, only for another harsh orgasm to rocket through
her body. She once again collapsed onto the ground, the energy darting
out around her, pushing the chair at her side across the room and
slamming it into a bookcase. The table in front of her screeched as it
was pushed harshly across the wood panel floor of the shop.\
\
"Don\'t\...you think that\...this is getting\...just a LITTLE out of
hand, Whit\...?" Nissa asked in between gasps. Whit waited there for a
moment before shrugging again. The rumbles in Nissa\'s chest returned,
as she swallowed nervously, awaiting for what her bust had in store for
her next.\
\
She could feel this build up was going to be big. The tingles and
prickles were ramping up much faster this time. Her breasts were
trembling on their own as they hung in her sweater. She began to moan
loudly as her tits burned with pleasure. Her arms began to shake as
their strength was sapped for her incoming growth. Her whole body rocked
and convulsed.\
\
And yet it seemed to be teasing her. Right on the precipices of release
to end her rampant torment of pleasure.\
\
\"Oooooooooh GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!\" Nissa gasped as her eyes were glazed
and hazy from her lack of focus. Items around her began to float form
the shelves and orbit her as she couldn\'t focus on anything but her
throbbing mammaries.\
\
"Have a nice day ma\'am!" Sakura waved the customer out of the door, her
voice obviously shaking as she held back the earnest desire to scratch,
or even just grasp her ass. As soon as the customer was out of sight,
she slouched, letting out a deep breath. "Well THAT could have ended up
a lot worse\..." It was at that moment she caught sight of an object
flying across the room, seemingly on its own, towards the lounge area of
the store. "Wha\...?" Sakura looked quizzically over. Slowly she walked
over, feeling her ass rub tentatively against her failing jeans. Still
they split, wider across the center, revealing more and more of her
cheeks to the world, only covered by her panties.\
\
"Shit\..." She wanted to pull her pants together to cover it, but
luckily had the foresight not to do so. Her ass was obviously still
growing, but the last thing she wanted to do was spur it on more\...as
she walked over to the scene, she finally saw what the commotion was.
Objects spun and roated around the peach-haired beauty. She sat there,
panting, her sweater shredding and her breasts throbbing."Wha?!
N-Nissa?! What is going o-"\
\
"GRAB ASS!" Mano had snuck up behind Sakura, hastily gripping her ass
cheeks harshly as she yelled out the phrase.\
\
RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIP\
\
Sakura\'s ass and hips sprang forth from the denim prison that had
squeezed her so. Her hips and thighs and bubble butt thundered in
place.\
\
Fabric splattered onto Mano as Sakrua\'s ass broke free.\
\
And with that freedom came the cost of her resolve.\
\
She fell to her knees, causing her breasts to bounce harshly in her
shirt. Her arms reached out back and grabbed a huge handful of each
cheek and began to scratch herself.\
\
\"OOOOOOOOH YEEEEES\" Sakura cooed as she found utter relief. She
scratched and scratched and scratched her ass. And in kind, her ass
rapidly ballooned in her grasp. Her hips pushed sideways more and more,
spreading out so much it took up over 95% of the aisle. Her monstrous
thighs bloated along with her other sections, becoming the soft pontoons
that supported the other half of her kneeling position.\
\
Sakura leaned forward as was pushed up by her full bust. A large puddle
of milk began form beneath her bloated mammaries. The attack went as
fast as it had came. All the while Mano howled with laughter. Meanwhile,
Nissa stared down at herself, still unaware of what was happening
nearby. Her focus was fully on her bust, and soon, it caught Mano\'s
attention as well. They both stared at it curiously as it shook, her
sweater barely hanging on by a thread. \
\
Nissa straightened in place, letting out a gasp. She stared forward, her
eyes wide. Pleasure struck through her spine like lightning, causing her
back to arch more. Her tits thrust forward as one final orgasm ripped
through her whole being.\
\
And with that sensation, her tits rocketed forward, pushing outwards at
an alarming pace. Now no longer growing in spurts, her tits lumbered
forward, puffing and swelling with no end seemingly in sight. All the
while Nissa flailed her arms, moaning and shrieking as her sweater
finally peeled into two.\
\
She had reached Sakura\'s medicine ball size, but didn\'t stop there.
Her tits swelled and swelled, getting bigger and bigger in no time. Soon
she was the size of jumbo watermelons, but even then it didn\'t stop.
More and more Nissa swelled up. Her naked bosom quivered forth, her cute
nipples erect and seeking anything to touch. Just when it seems like
Nissa might grow out of control, her screaming seemed to be the signal
that she was done.\
\
Sweat dripped form her forehead as she gasped and panting, her tits
heaving with her breathe.\
\
Down the aisle, Sakura had filled up the aisle space with her ass. Her
moans were finally dying down as her growth was slowing as well. The
adjacent bookcases groaned a bit under the pressure put forth by
Sakura\'s new, plush hips. For a moment, there was only silence as the
girls caught their breath. Mano staring at the two of them expectantly,
not knowing what to say. Finally, Nissa attempted to stand. It took her
a moment, her body flopping back down to her massive mams, but again she
tried, finally standing up. Her boobs drooped down, but not in a sag
sort of way. They formed a perfect teardrop shape, cresting right at the
top of her hips. She merely looked down in horror.\
\
"C-could I get\...a shirt please?" Was all she could ask. Sakura looked
behind herself, her breath catching in her throat. She then looked over
at Mano, her eyebrows furrowing.\
\
"You!" She tried to stand, her ass wedged between two heavy bookcases.
After a bit of wiggling, she finally popped out of the other side,
rubbing her soft, yet firm cheeks, only contained in her over-taxed
panties. "I should have KNOWN you\'d do something like this!" Mano threw
her hands up in defense.\
\
\"I didn\'t do all of THAT!!\" Mano gestured to the Goodyear blimps
attached to Sakura\'s rear. \"I just gave you a small pinch. YOU knocked
the rest in yourself. And it was HILARIOUS!" Sakura finally fouhnd her
footing and stood, taking a heavy step towards Mano, trying to make
herself as menacing as possible while under these circumstances.\
\
"The fact that you put any in there\...at ALL, or put it near me,
or\...or\...ugh!" Sakura wanted to charge at Mano, but she knew it
wouldn\'t amount to anything. She stood straight, feeling her thighs rub
against one another, her milk jugs still leaking by the second. Not that
she could handle that right now.\
\
"Hey, lighten up, I\'m sure that stuff wears off\...eventually?" Mano
offered sympathetically. Sakura shot her back a sharp look.\
\
"And what if it doesn\'t Mano? Huh? What then? You just gave me car
tires for ass cheeks!"\
\
"I think you\'re exaggerating just a bit there-"\
\
"I don\'t CARE!" Sakura thrust her fists behind her, feeling a gust of
wind burst forth in front of her. Mano wobbled a bit on her feet, but
maintained her balance.\
\
"Look, Sakura, I\'m sorry-"\
\
"I really doubt that at this point Mano. Any chance you get to make
Nissa and I bust through our clothes, or worse, you take! I\'m
just\...I\'m sick of it!" She crossed her arms under her bust, scowling,
looking to the side. "You\'re lucky I haven\'t kicked you out yet." She
just barely said it, but the reaction from Mano was immediate. A gasp of
shock, and an immediate regret. Mano pulled away from it as coolly as
she could.\
\
"Look, Sakura\...I know I\'ve sorta\...fucked up a lot in the past, and
I really never mean anything that bad when I do anything. Its just a
little fun, y\'know? We used to do it to each other all the time\..."\
\
"If I recall correctly, it was you doing stuff to me nine times out of
ten. You WERE the magic one, after all. Still are." \
\
"Hey, even if you couldn\'t do magic, I\'d still let you pick out spells
for me." Mano huffed, her J-cups wobbling inside her tight, black, long
sleeve shirt. "It was all fun and games back then. What\'s so different
now?"\
\
"The difference is that I\'m barely able to get through doorways now
Mano!" Sakura fumed, stomping her foot, feeling the new girth of her
thighs and ass squish against her. "You keep screwing around with this
stuff, not knowing what it would do, and\...now look at us! Look at
you!"\
\
"None of this is my fault!" Mano pointed to her tits. "This is all that
bitch Tiffany\'s fault! She\'s the one that\'s actually done, like,
permanent damage. Hell, the thing I used on you was in this shop!" The
two quieted for a moment, gathering their thoughts. Nissa sat idly by,
her hands just barely covering her nipples.\
\
\"I-its getting pretty bad\" Whit piped up as he sat next to Nissa,
hiding form all the shouting.\
\
Nissa only nodded, wishing they would stop.\
\
Both perked up from a sudden loud pop and screams.\
\
Sakura was now on her bare fat bottom. Above her was a large, purplish
whisp looking entity. \
\
It swiped at Mano, who screamed and ducked out of the way. The clawed
hands phased through the book cases while at the same time didn\'t,
knocking all sorts of things off the shelves. It made one more upward
swipe at Mano, who stumbled out of the way and ran out of the shop.\
\
As soon as Mano was out of sight, the ghoulish creature stopped its
energy churning and separated into several purples spirits, each lazily
drifting back to Sakura\'s wet bosom. She simply trembled at what had
happened.\
\
"I\'m impressed, dear." Sakura jumped at the familiar voice.\
\
"O-oh\...Tiffany\...how long have-"\
\
"Just got back in time to see that little\...encounter. You\'re getting
a bit of control over those little troublemakers inside of you, it
seems\...voluntarily or not."\
\
"Wait, then wouldn\'t that defeat the idea of having \'control\' over-"\
\
"Hush, dear, the point is that your spirits are actually LISTENING to
you now. They\'re feeling what you\'re feeling, rather than
just\...existing inside your body." She stepped over to Sakura, smiling,
resting a hand on her shoulder. "You held the shop down well while I was
out." She finally looked down to see the damage done to Sakura\'s
flaring hips and ass. "\...ok, what did you do to your ass?"\
\
"Wh-WHAT? I didn\'t do this, this was all Mano\'s fault\...kind of!"
Sakura wiggled in place. "She used some kind of\...itching powder and it
made me puff up outta control and\...and\..." Tiffany placed a finger on
Sakura\'s mouth to quiet her.\
\
"Shhh\...its fine, dear. I understand." Sakura perked up.\
\
"So you can fix this?"\
\
"You said itching powder right?" Sakura nodded. For a moment, Tiffany
thought, scratching her head. "\...no, no I don\'t think there\'s a cure
for that one\..."\
\
"Wh\...what?" Sakura\'s heart plummeted to the bottom of her being.
Tiffany merely nodded and continued her explanation. \
\
"Yes, I recall that one having permanent effects, that\'s why I put
explicit instructions on the front\...instructions that friend of yours
apparently didn\'t read all that well\..."\
\
"\...I hesitate to call her a friend at this point\..." Sakura muttered,
turning over to Nissa. Nissa merely sat there, watching the
conversation. Whit sat on her shoulder, his eyes still glued to Nissa\'s
new monolithic rack. Tiffany followed her gaze, and as soon as her eyes
hit Nissa\'s bust, she let out a groan.\
\
"Oh, and what happened to YOU?" Tiffany stepped over worriedly to Nissa,
who was still wrapped up in what was happening in front of her. As soon
as attention was back on her bust, she snapped back into reality, tears
forming in her eyes.\
\
"I\...there was\...there\..." She couldn\'t get the words out before
bursting into tears, burying her face into her cleavage as she let out
soft, petite sobs. Tiffany sat next to the beauty, rubbing her back
consolingly. \
\
"Well\...it seems you two have had\...quite the day\..." \
\
A bit of time passed. Nissa sipped at some herbal tea as she was draped
in an old sheet used to cover the older, more fragile pieces in the
shop.\
\
Tiffany had gotten all the info out of Whit to help piece together the
events. She wasn\'t able to reverse any of them though, and even looking
through her tomes there weren\'t any sure fire choices.\
\
\"GAAH! WHAT!?\"\
\
Nissa perked up ant turned to her friend. Sakura had a sheet wrapped
around her massive derriere, which pushed thru and showed off all her
round swells. Sakura was in some form of distress, jutting her hips to
and fro without rhythm.\
\
\"ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?\" Tiffany peeked around the book case. \
\
\"Whats wrong now dear?\"\
\
\"THEY\'RE IN MY BUTT!\"\
\
\"What?\"\
\
\"My SPIRITS!\" She cried, but shook her bottom again, plagued by the
feeling of her ghostly companions occupying her freshly grown pumpkin
butt. After the initial shock had worn off, however, she
felt\...relieved somehow? "Wha\...?" Sakura stood more easily than she
had before, as if her whole body was\...lighter, despite her new mass.\
\
"Ahh\...I\'m not entirely well versed in the ways of spirits, but if I
had to take a guess\..." Tiffany walked around Sakura, observing her
entire form. Sakura\'s butt glowed a soft blue color for a moment before
dimming once again to her natural colors. "It seems your spirits are
re-locating throughout your whole body."\
\
"Wha\...what does that mean?"\
\
"It means, dear, that the more of you there is, the more space they have
to move around. And the more space they have to move around, the less
agitated they appear\..." Tiffany smiled, patting Sakura\'s tush, seeing
it light up for a moment before calming again. Sakura let out a light
"peep" in response. "In the long run, I think this will help you
maintain control over them." \
\
"R\...really?" Sakura asked in a hushed tone. Tiffany nodded assuredly.\
\
"I\'m not expert, but I have pretty good idea of how these things might
behave, being around Autumn so much." She turned to Nissa, who was still
sipping her tea solemnly. "And as for you, miss\..." Tiffany sauntered
over to Nissa casually. "You\'re pretty balanced out at this point, I\'d
think. I\'m still surprised that you beat my assistant here in terms of
bust size. That\'s impressive." Nissa blushed and frowned, but Tiffany
pulled up her chin, making Nissa\'s eyes meet hers. "I think we have
some additional training we can do now." \
\
"W-what do you mean?" Tiffany grinned broadly and straightened up,
looking at both the ladies proudly. "I think its time I started teaching
you some advanced stuff\...personally." She stepped over to the back of
the store, looking back over to the two of them. "You two are staying
the night. I won\'t have any nay-saying about that. And
tomorrow\...tomorrow, we\'re going to really get cracking." That was all
she said before she turned and climbed the stairs towards the attic,
letting out a "night, ladies" before shutting the door behind her.\
\
Tiffany poked her head back out. \"And Ill whip up some temporary
clothes for you ladies. Niiiiiiiiight\"\
\
Sakura and Nissa simply glanced at each other.\
\
\"So how does it feel to have the big girl boobs now?\" Sakura joked.\
\
"Probably the same as it feels to be the big booty girl now." Nissa
replied with a giggle. The two of them sat there, laughing and joking
about the situation. Both of them were uneasy about this. Sakura
questioned continuing working at the store, living with Mano\...Nissa
didn\'t know if she still wanted to be around Tiffany.\
\
But for the time being, they forgot about this, and chose to cheer
themselves up by talking, joking and finally passing out in the store on
the couches nearby.\
\
Meanwhile, Mano finally stepped into the apartment, gasping for breath.\
\
"Dumb\...Sakura\...doesn\'t know\...stupid\...ghost fuckers\...ugh\..."
With a huge sigh she flopped onto her bed boobs-first and fell into a
fitful slumber\...\

CH 9: Manolithic

"Well\...that\'s that, I suppose\..." Tiffany muttered as she dusted off
her hands, cleaning up the last of the shop. The chaos from earlier in
the day had been accounted for; all of the books and trinkets that had
been knocked over in the fuss from before had been cleaned up. The
ceramic shards of the bottle Nissa had tossed were all picked up and
thrown out. "All in all, you both didn\'t do all THAT much damage\..."
Tiffany looked over at the ladies and almost giggled at what she saw.\
\
They both stood there, assessing their new sizes. Both had a look of
worry plastered across their faces. Sakura had her hands on her hips,
circling around to feel her cheeks, which pushed out so far behind her
they surpassed her head in being the furthest thing sticking out. She
squeezed them together, feeling her panties strain as the flesh pushed
upwards. How they were still together at all was a miracle.\
\
Nissa, on the other hand, had almost a look of horror across her face.
Now that she was standing, she could finally assess her actual size.
Tits that seemed to reach her hips when sitting only seemed to grace her
mid-waist. But that was still much too large for her, and while she was
glad she hadn\'t broken into yoga ball-sized proportions, she wasn\'t
far behind that with tits the size of VERY large medicine balls. She
poked and prodded them, the makeshift shirt that Tiffany had created her
being form fitting, but more revealing than she was used to, cleavage
spilling from the neckline.\
\
"Um\...are you\...are you sure that\...that there\'s no way
to\...to\..." Nissa nervously asked Tiffany, but she interrupted before
she could finish.\
\
"I told you dear, there were very specific instructions on the bottle
that says the catalyst needs to be added BEFORE its applied to make it
so its only temporary. That size is not going down dear, I\'m sorry. How
it got poured on you in the first place is another problem entirely\..."
Tiffany\'s gaze flipped back over to Sakura, who was still staring
flabbergasted at her titanic tush. Stepping over, she put a hand gently
on her assistant\'s shoulder.\
\
"Look, dear\..."\
\
"Tiff\...its huge\..."\
\
"I know, dear, and I\'m sorry there\'s nothing I can do for it\..."\
\
"Its bigger than Nissa\'s EVER was!" Sakura felt bad at her outcry,
knowing it would likely only bring attention back to Nissa\'s large rump
as well. But it was true, she beat her size by a good foot or so. But
Nissa had her beat in terms of tits now. All of this was just
so\...insane. "Tiff, what do we do now?" A moment of silence followed,
Tiffany taking in a deep sigh.\
\
"We get to work as soon as possible. The quicker I can teach you things,
the quicker you can get a grip on your new sizes."\
\
Both girls nodded a bit glumly. With no way to fix themselves, all they
could do was adapt as fast as possible to make it as easy for them in
the future.\
\
\"Hey Tiff? Could I get something to cover up my-\" Sakura began. She
took a step, and her whole lower half quivered with intensity. The
omnidirectional undulations of her ripe girl meat bumped the night stand
next to her. On this nightstand stood a very narrow vase, one that was
now in the process of falling.\
\
Nissa gasped just as she saw it tip out of the corner of her eye.\
\
There was no crash. No shattering. Nothing.\
\
Sakura stood their wide eyed. She slowly turned her head to find the
vase laying horizontally across her bottom, safe and sound. Tiffany
chuckled at first, then burst out laughing as soon as the event had
finished unfolding.\
\
"See? That big booty of yours isn\'t THAT bad after all! Especially when
it can act as a plushy shelf for my merchandise." Tiffany joked. Sakura
smirked sardonically as she picked up the vase and placed it back on the
end table. Tiffany wiped a tear out of her eye and adjusted her glasses,
stepping back over to the center of the room. "So\...let\'s asses what
we can do here\...and what would be helpful for you two in the long
run." She waved for the two to follow her, and they did, in time. Sakura
still had to adjust to her thighs now rubbing together as she stepped
forwards, and the constant jiggling of her behind, rubbing up against
her pants as it moved. Nissa could hear her shirt creaking and groaning,
and she silently begged it to keep together and not burst into a million
pieces with every step she made.\
\
Tiffany pointed to Nissa. "You. You\'re getting quite good at
telekinesis, correct?" Nissa paused, then nodded.\
\
"I\'m\...getting some things done."\
\
"Psychic abilities are intrinsically connected to magic. I\'ve learned
that over the years. And you." She pointed over to Sakura. "Those
spirits of yours will be both your greatest ally, and possibly your
greatest foe. Its why we need to get them in line ASAP." Sakura\'s boobs
and ass both quivered in response, glowing for a short amount of time
before calming.\
\
Sakura went wide eyed again as she felt herself leave the ground, only
to stay afloat a few inches above the ground\
\
\"My point exactly\" Tiffany stated as she grabbed Sakura around the
waist and pulled her along.\
\
\"So, starting today, we are going to begin a SERIOUS training session
to get things in line.\"\
\
Tiffany held onto the floating Sakura by her tight tank top while she
leafed through an old tome in the back.\
\
\"Nissa.\"\
\
Nissa jumped slightly, her bountiful breasts giving a heavy bounce.\
\
\"You and I will start with, quite simply, weight training. Today\"\
\
Nissa simply nodded, still taking everything in.\
\
\"And you\...\" Tiffany turned towards the levitating bottom heavy
assistant \"Will be working with Autumn again.\"\
\
Tiffany took a moment to try and force Sakura on the ground, but her
boobs glowed brighter in protest, bobbing back to her few inches of
levitation.\
\
\"She needs to get those little jerks in line.\" She let go of Sakura,
watching her float for a bit before the spirits finally calmed, allowing
her to gently float back down to the floor. \"BUT! Before any of
that\...\" Tiffany said as she moved forward, suddenly turning on her
heels and bringing her hands together. \"We need to go shopping for
clothes!\"\
\
Meanwhile, back at the apartment, Mano laid in her bed, twisting and
turning in her sleep. She muttered nonsense to herself, the ambient
coolness of her room not helping keep the heat of her body down in the
slightest. Her bed creaked as she tossed around, the weight of her chest
never letting up for her. She laid on her side, then her back, then back
to her side. \
\
Mano\'s room was immaculate. Even in the darkness, it seemed to have a
soft glow about it. Her bed was brass, painted gold, with a baroque
headboard. Red and white roses decorated across its surface. Nearby was
a vanity, a large mirror that nearly touched the ceiling and took up
most of the wall space adorned the regal white shelves and drawers.
Across the other side of the room was a large bookshelf, the same color
as her vanity, with golden accents, packed to the brim with various
spellbooks, all of which she had been leafing through to find any sort
of loophole in order to reduce herself to her former size.\
\
Unfortunately, Mano had a curse placed upon her over a year ago, when
Tiffany had first cursed her chest to her current L cup size (more or
less). Any magic that she used on it would be absorbed and would cause
her to grow even bigger as a result. As much as she wanted to experiment
with more spells that could possibly reduce her back to her old D cup
self, she was afraid of puffing herself up to even more ridiculous
proportions. Somehow Mano still managed to dream through her fitful
slumber\...familiar images and places amalgamated within her
subconscious\...\
\
As Mano laid on her side, not moving, the bed began to creak ever so
slightly. Every few minutes the springs on her bed would creak as if she
had moved. but she wasn\'t moving at all. Then came the straining of
fabric. Even more sporadic in occurrence than the springs, creaking
threads came from Mano. She grunted and rolled onto her back.\
\
Her medicine ball breasts rolled up with her chest and wobbled about,
puffing out of her collar. Their growth wasn\'t quick or noticeable, but
steady. Her head was moving in her sleep. Her eyes fluttered. She spoke
half words. Inaudible words. Strange words. She was dreaming\...\
\
The picture took a minute to clear, but there she was, in the living
room with Sakura. An ordinary day, it seemed. Mano laid back on the
couch and relaxed, letting out a delighted sigh.\
\
"Its nice to get some down time, amirite, milk tanks?" Mano snickered at
the nickname as she looked over at Sakura. The busty blue-haired babe
was at her usual medicine ball size, but she wore a sad face for some
reason. Mano took notice immediately. "What\'s up boobzilla?" Sakura
looked over at the red head and pouted.\
\
"Its just\...I\'m\...so big now\..." Mano scoffed.\
\
"Yeah, no kidding. Like I said, if you keep working for that Tiffany
bitch, you\'re gonna outgrow the apartment-"\
\
"Tiffany? She didn\'t do any of this! This was all you Mano!" \
\
\"Wait wha-\" Mano began.\
\
\"You did this Mano! It was you from the START! If you had just not
messed around with constant Magic Spells I wouln\'t be so DAMN HUGE! \"
Sakura shouted, struggling to stand up with her lumber ass and thighs
wiggling behind her\
\
\"This wasn\'t me! Its all the British bitch\'s Fault!\" Mano retorted,
herself struggling to her own feet\
\
\"I could still be working at the restaurant and able to see my feet
when I sit! Now I\'m lucky if I\'m able to see them in the shower!\"\
\
"How is this any of my fault? Seriously, you haven\'t explained-"\
\
"You were the magic one! You cursed Nissa and me and\...everyone else
all the time! And now look at me! If it wasn\'t for you, Tiffany
wouldn\'t have ever been here!"\
\
"\...well I can\'t argue that, I guess\..." Mano\'s hands curled into
fists in frustration. "I never wanted any of this ok? I never wanted
volleyball tits\...or however big these things are now!" She pushed them
up with her hands to emphasize, the weight still heavy on her shoulders.
"I\'d do anything to shrink back down to normal!"\
\
Mano gasped in her sleep. Her breasts had pushed out a great deal in
just a few seconds. The rumbled up and out from her chest, quivering
form the small puffs of flesh pouring into her inflating bosom. \
\
Her breasts hungrily pushed out like this a couple times a minute,
reaching higher and higher on her frame. Soon her entire upper torso was
covered under her huge breasts. Her face, just visible in her tightening
cleavage, was blushing and wore a look of distress. Her eyes were
frantically moving and her head turned over and over.\
\
"Ah!" Sakura gasped, wincing and jolting backwards.\
\
"What? What\'s going o-" Mano looked down at herself. Her tits. They
were shrinking. She looked back up to see that Sakura\'s were doing
quite the opposite" "Wait, NO!"\
\
"How could you?!" Sakura cried out, her tits expanding and charging
outwards in tandem with Mano\'s shrinkage. They flowed out and
downwards, past her navel and to her thighs, the bottoms peeking out of
the bottom of her shirt. Her wide ass wiggled behind her as she moaned,
the sensation bringing conflicting thoughts throughout her whole being.\
\
"I\'m not\...this isn\'t\...I dunno!" Watches in horror as her best
friend grows more and more, getting bigger by the second.\
\
Sakuras breasts halted as did Manos. For a moment there was a silence as
they stared each other down. Then came a grumbling\...\
\
\"OoooooOOOOOOOOOHHHH!!!!!\" Sakura released a winding groan as her
boobs shook and rounded out in moments. Just as she reached near
spherical, milk shot out of her nipples like two fire hydrants, each jet
flanking Mano.\
\
She gushed and gushed and gushed. She was lactating violently with a
seemingly endless supply of milk.\
\
\"FIX ME NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWW!\" Mano merely stared, flabbergasted.\
\
"I\...I don\'t know how!" Sakura\'s tits were huge. Massive. They almost
touched the floor! Mano stared, slack jawed, as geyesers of milk
continued to flow from Sakura\'s nips. It was then that a sudden "SNAP!"
filled the air.\
\
"Well\...well\...well\...what do we have here?" Mano scowled.\
\
"Ugh\...not YOU again!"\
\
Meanwhile, in reality, Mano\'s tits were surging forward in size. As she
thrashed her head about, her tits continued to spread. Bigger and
bigger, fatter and fatter, her boobs had reached down to the tips of her
feet, and soon conquered all the space there as well.\
\
Mano\'s right breast was closer to the bed edge. After a few quakes from
the owner beneath them, her bosom softly rolled over the edge. The
result was Mano and her other car sized breast were pull off the bed.
She came to settle atop her swelling masses.\
\
She still thrashed about in her sleep. Hips bucked, head turned, her
breathing was labored.\
\
"What a mess you have made, dear\..." The bright red locks of hair. The
sharp, pointed glasses. The red and black striped corset. Mano knew just
from the tinge of a British accent from her voice who it was.\
\
"Tiffany\...what do you want?"\
\
"I see you\'re torturing my assistant again. Making her bigger, I see?
And did you get\...smaller? Well that\'s no good\..." Tiffany pointed at
Mano, and immediately, her tits leaped in size, past her old medicine
balls, almost meeting Sakura in her current size.\
\
"AHHHH!" Mano collapsed over onto her tits. Her breath heavy, she puffed
her hair out of her face with a quick breath, glaring up at Tiffany
harshly. "No\...not this time\...you BITCH!"\
\
Tiffany sneered at first. Then her face changed. A look no one had ever
seen her display: shock.\
\
Her comparatively tiny breasts began to swell out of her corset like
water balloons on tap. She brought her hands up to meet them, simply in
shock as she felt them pumping bigger and bigger.\
\
Mano on the other hand, was shrinking yet again. She had waited for this
moment for over a year. Her perfect revenge. She smiled and cackled as
she watched Tiffany puff out and out, bigger by the second as she
regained her footing.\
\
"Suck on that, bitch. Haha!"\
\
However, despite Mano\'s imaginations of victory, the reality was that
she was still growing. And fast. Her tits had pushed her upwards, her
feet leaving the ground as her giant orbs of tit flesh pushed into the
wall nearby -- as well as the open doorway.\
\
Her expanding front had everywhere to go but the wall, so she was slowly
propelled away from the wall and towards the door, her breast rising
higher and higher with each passing moment as it soon widened passed the
width of the frame.\
\
\"OH MY GOD!!! HOW!?\" Tiffany shrieked, dropping to her knees as she
cradled her inflating basketballs.\
\
\"Doesn\'t matter how. I\'m going to get you back for this last year of
back pain 100 FOLD!\" Mano shouted.\
\
Behind them, Sakura had been growing. A lot. The poor girl wailed atop
her boobs, easily taller than Tiffany standing upright. Milk still
gushed form her nipples as she attained more and more mass. \
\
"And then I\'m going to fix my friend! You got that? But first!" Mano
concentrated hard, focusing all her energy on Tiffany. The result was an
exponential increase in Tiffany\'s rate of expansion. Her tits shot
forward, her corset bursting at the top seams. They lolled forwards,
getting as big as medicine balls, then further and further, covering her
stomach and thighs in no time.\
\
"You\...you can\'t! Stop this immediately!" Tiffany\'s voice tried to be
stern, but wavered in the heat of the moment. She couldn\'t deny that
her growth felt spectacular, even now. Mano grinned devilishly.\
\
\"HOWS IT FEEL, HUH!?\" \
\
Tiffany growled slightly, pointing her hand at Mano. The result was a
flash shooting down her arm and into her boobs. Her tits pumped up
again, but her ass also blimped out behind her, making her gasp in
surprise. It swelled out a good two feet. Mano looked behind herself,
her face turning to a deep blush. She quickly faced Tiffany yet again.\
\
"Oh so THAT\'S how we\'re gonna play it then?! Take THIS!" Mano pointed
at Tiffany and watched as her own ass ballooned outwards and behind her.
Her tits were still growing out of control. Mano had gotten control of
herself and was working on a way to shrink herself back down. But before
she could, she could hear Tiffany let out a low laugh.\
\
"You can try as much as you want, Mano\...it won\'t matter. You\'ll be
huge\...whether you like it or not!"\
\
"What?" Mano shouted. Just as she did, the image in front of her started
to fade. Sakura and Tiffany both dissolved from her sight,a s well as
the room. She looked down, only to see her growing tits getting even
larger. As they touched the ground, Mano shuddered, feeling herself
getting lifted off the ground. "No, no, no!"\
\
Manos eyes fully opened. She recognized the familiar aura of her white
room. The soft pink masses in front of her shook like agitated jello as
she rose higher and higher. She began to kick and scream as she was
glued atop her puffing mountains.\
\
Meanwhile, Sakura and Nissa had made their way home, with Tiffany
alongside. They chatted about various things, but mostly the further
training they would receive later on.\
\
"You\'re getting already dears. I\'m proud of you both." Tiffany patted
both their bosoms enthusiasitcally, bringing out a blush in both of
them. As they made their way home, Tiffany looked up at an empty lot.
She paused, the other ladies walking up ahead of her, before noticing
she had stopped.\
\
"What\'s up Tiff?" Sakura asked. Tiffany smiled, looking upon the old
worn down building.\
\
"Nothing\...this place just reminds me of my shop, before I had it
flipped. You know, I\'ve been thinking of expanding the business?"\
\
"Yeah? How would you do that?" Sakura replied, stretching a bit, her
medicine ball mams pushing outwards. Nissa took a side glance at her
friend, wishing she had boobs of those size now, her new beach ball
boobs weighing down heavily upon her chest. She did her best to ignore
them.\
\
"In time, I suppose. I\'m still figuring things out as of right now."
Tiffany mused, looking up at the vacant lot before making her way
alongside the girls once again.\
\
Tiffany snuck a glance at Sarkua\'s stretch, mused, then gave a playful
glomp.\
\
\"Lets get you girls home to rest up. You\'ve had a busy day.\" She
said, Kura wriggling in her embrace. After a five minute or so walk
back, they made it back. After a bit of jiggling and shuffling through
the doorway, Sakura getting her hips stuck midway through the door,
Nissa having to go in one boob at a time, they made it in.\
\
"Mano? We\'re home!"\
\
Silence.\
\
Usually there was some sort of response. A spell, a coin tossed, a
shout. But there was nothing.\
\
Sakura pushed her wide hips along the narrow passes with much effort
before she sprung free into the living room.\
\
"Mano?\" She asked again. Still no reply.\
\
\"I\'ll go knock on her door\" Nissa said, turning her hourglass body
down the hall way. She could see light just cracking out of the top of
Manos door.\
\
\"Hey Ma-\" She stopped, noticing the oddity of how her door was shut.
It was like her door had melted into a sort of angle.\
\
Then the angle in question quivered and a moan cam from behind.\
\
\"W-wha\...\" Nissa moved closer, gently touching the door. Her finger
sank into the mass. A shriek came from behind.\
\
It was flesh.\
\
"Nissa? What was that?!" Sakura called out as she made her way down the
hall. Nissa was speechless. All she could do was stare upon the
flesh-filled doorway in awes. Eventually, Sakura made it over to her,
but couldn\'t stand next to her due to their added width. She merely
stared over Nissa\'s side. She couldn\'t believe her eyes. "No
way\...Mano?!"\
\
A muffled yell could be heard from beyond the wall. Sakura focused,
briefly hearing the words "big tittied" "monsters" "what the fuck",
among other phrases. "N-Nissa\...I think\...this is Mano\..."\
\
"Huh? But how?!" Nissa asked, turning her head back to the flesh pouring
out in front of them.\
\
\"Trust me, I KNOW what this is like\...\" Sakura said. \"I-I guess its
time I try that wall walking thing again\...\" \
\
"The what?" Nissa asked, bewildered. But before she knew it, Sakura had
gone semi-transparent, moving her way through the walls nearby. She
moved around the flesh and towards a different wall, all solids now
making no difference to her translucent body. After a lot of focus and
movement, she had made her way into Mano\'s room, her body becoming full
solid again. As soon as it did, she was pushed up against the wall
behind her.\
\
"Mano?!"\
\
"Sakura? Is that you?" The voice came from atop the mountainous orbs.
She was almost pressed up against the ceiling, her ass brushing it
lightly against it.\
\
"What the hell happened to you?"\
\
"That\'s what I wanna know! I just woke up like this!"\
\
"I believe I can explain that\..." Sakura looked upwards, seeing Tiffany
poof into the room, sitting on one of Mano\'s giant breasts. "You see, I
placed a curse on you long ago-"\
\
"Yeah, and I really appreciate tha-"\
\
"Let me finish." Tiffany cleared her throat, pushing up her glasses a
bit. "That curse that I placed made it so that any reversing magic that
you perform on yourself would instead cause you to grow. What I didn\'t
anticipate\...was you casting in your sleep. I thought that had was
unheard of\...but the fact that one can talk in their sleep\...I suppose
the notion isn\'t that far off now, is it?" \
\
"Alright, well, whoopty-doo, now change me back!" Mano yelled out,
wobbling on top of her massive pontoons.\
\
"Er\...well, it isn\'t that simple, dear\..."\
\
"\...what do you mean?"\
\
"Well\...the sort of curse I placed needed a fail safe\...something to
keep on the weight just in case\..."\
\
"What does that even mean?!"\
\
"Look, the short answer is that\...there\'s absolutely no way you can
possibly shrink this permanently. None of my spells will do it, none of
your spells will do it; no magic period will do it. I\'m sorry. I never
thought it would get\...THIS out of hand!"\
\
"So\...so I\'m stuck like this\...forever?" Sakura could actually see
Mano tearing up. She looked back at Tiffany and saw that she had likely
noticed as well. She had a stern face on for a moment before lifting her
head.\
\
"I\'ve got an idea." With that, she poofed out. Sakura and Mano just sat
there, both squishing up against Mano\'s room-filling tits.\
\
"These are\...pretty huge." Sakura mumbled. Mano didn\'t speak. She
merely laid there, body splayed out, sunk into her new decolletage.
"\...Mano, I know you\'re\...probably not doing alright right now
but\...look, I get it, ok\..."\
\
"I know you do Sakura." With that interruption, Sakura stopped
immediately. Mano turned and looked at her friend. Her eyes still seemed
wet. "Look\...I\'ve been thinking\...and\...you\'re probably right, ok?
I\...I kinda messed with you and Nissa a bit too much in the past\...and
I guess it all sorta\...caught up with me."\
\
"You can\'t mean-"\
\
"Yeah. Karma."\
\
"But this is way too much-"\
\
"I mean, yeah\...yeah. I don\'t exactly think I deserve
this\...forever\..."\
\
"Neither do I, dear." The words appeared before Tiffany did. She sat
where she had been once before, a bra in hand. It was simple: black,
lacy, but with a strange glow along its wiring.\
\
"Uh\...what\...is that?"\
\
"Our solution, dear." Tiffany said with a smile.\
\
"That\...tiny bra? That\'s our solution? No offense, Tiff, but I don\'t
think that\'ll fi-"\
\
As if to prove Mano wrong immediately, Tiffany pressed a small red
button near the center of the bra. Like magic, the fabric stretched and
moved as Tiffany dropped it upon Mano\'s bust. It crawled across
seamlessly, covering the vast expanse of boobage that Mano now toted. As
soon as every square inch of breast had been covered, it clasped to her
back with a "click".\
\
"\...alright, that\'s nice that they\'re covered in all, but I don\'t
see how this-"\
\
Once again she was cut off as her breasts wobbled, jiggled, then
suddenly began to deflate.\
\
"No fucking WAY!" Mano\'s face lit up immediately as her bust shrunk
back down. Sakura could finally put her feet on the ground, and Tiffany
joined her not long after. A half a minute passed before Mano\'s own
feet could touch the ground as well, her bust shrinking all the way down
to DDs. "But\...but how? I thought you said-"\
\
"I said there\'s no way to shrink them PERMANENTLY. This bra is a very
specific invention -- one I made a long time ago for such an issue. This
will keep your bust at your current small size\...for only as long as it
is worn. And like any heavy-duty magical item, it needs to be recharged
every day if you want it to work."\
\
"So like a cell phone?"\
\
"\...if you want to simplify it like that, yes." Tiffany opened her hand
to show a small black box with blue lit-up highlights. "Here, catch."
She tossed the box over to Mano and she caught it. "This bra is the only
thing that will keep you from being so\..."\
\
"Monolithic?" A small voice peeped out from the other side of the door.
Nissa had snuck in, a wry smile on her face, her bust still just above
her navel. The four just sat there in silence until Mano began to
snicker. The snicker turned into a giggle, then a laugh. This action
infected the rest of the ladies as they laughed at Nissa\'s pun. But
before they could go on for too long, Mano suddenly grunted, her tits
pushing out by an inch. Her tits muffined out of her bra a bit before
they adjusted.\
\
"Ah\...you\...might want to charge that thing now, dear\..." Mano
sighed, reaching back for the clasp.\
\
"Alright\...everyone better stand back then\..."

CH 10: Nissa\'s Bathtime Mishap

Nissa\'s hips swayed and bobbed up and down merrily as she hummed a soft
tune to herself, walking down the various aisles of the grocery store. A
small hand basket at her side, she was only grabbing a few personal
items for the day. Deodorant, toothpaste, soap, personal things like
that. She was just about to leave the aisle when one last item caught
her eye: a small bottle, shaped like two interlaced diamonds. The bottle
was clear, almost crystal-like, although when Nissa picked it up from
the shelf, it felt like plastic.\
\
"Hmmm\...what\'s this?" Nissa mused as she observed the bottle. "Big
Bubble Bubblebath" was printed in large letters across the front. The
standard stuff was on the back of the bottle, bragging about how great
it makes the skin feel and such. Nissa looked over the information.
"Treat yourself with an exfoliating and pleasing experience, only
brought to you by BBB\..." Her eyes glazed over after the first
sentence, coming to the conclusion that it was just ordinary bubble
bath, but in a fancy bottle. Shrugging, Nissa realized she hadn\'t
bought some of that for a while. "Mmm\...I should treat myself today!"
She chided, plopping the bottle in her basket and swaying her way up to
the checkout.\
\
As she pushed herself through the checkout line, her ass nearly knocked
every item behind her to the ground, but she managed to push herself up
far enough to keep anything from dropping down her skirt. Candy bars and
boxes teetered just over her skirt, but with enough concentration, she
kept them just on that razor\'s edge of balance. Of course, this meant
she had to push her bosom even further in front of her, causing the
checkout girl in front of her to give her even more strange, yet jealous
looks.\
\
"Your tit\...uh, total is \$39.79". The checkout girl fumbled with her
words before typing some things on the keypad as Nissa swiped her debit
card in front of her, going through the steps before grabbing her bags
with a sweet "thank you!" before walking back out to her car and driving
home. After squeezing her way out of her car, squeezing herself through
the door and into her living room, she managed to flop down onto the
couch with a sigh.\
\
As she sat there, she stared at the cleavage that filled up the bottom
of her peripheral vision. Bringing a hand to it, Nissa looked at
herself, rubbing the surface worriedly. "I\'m\...still not used to these
yet\..." she muttered to herself, pouting slightly as she stared down at
the foot of cleavage below her. Her extra large medicine balls now put
Sakura\'s tits to shame, and there was, apparently, no way of taking it
back. With yet another sigh, Nissa stood, shaking her head.\
\
"There\'s no good from just sitting around feeling sorry for myself! I
should relax and get my mind off of\...these\..." She grabbed her
grocery bag and made her way to the bathroom, putting the other items
away before pulling out the bubble bath. "\...yeah, I think\...this is
what I need right now\..." Nissa muttered as she turned the handle on
the faucet, cold water spouting from it, quickly converting to steaming
hot water. The bathroom was soon coated in a humid fog. As she plugged
up the drain in the tub, she splashed a generous amount of bubble bath
into near the plug, watching as foam almost immediately started to fill
along with water.\
\
"Ooh, it smells delightful!" Nissa tilted her head upwards and let out a
blissful sigh as the sweet yet flowery perfume of the contents in the
tub hit her nose. After letting the tub fill for a few minutes, Nissa
eventually began to peel the clothes off her body. She looked over to
her back and concentrated, feeling the back of the hem of her tank top
peeled up and around her, and then up in front and over her boobs. She
wanted to test her telekinesis in as many ways as she could, even for
mundane things such as clothing. Eventually her shirt was over her head,
and she moved on to her skirt, in which she focused yet again to pull
down with her mind. The pink pleated skirt eventually hit the ground,
and all she had to do was step over it. \
\
Now clad in only a bra and panties, Nissa concentrated harshly on her
back, and more specifically, the clasp of her bra. Feeling it suddenly
unhook and almost launch right off her tits as they pushed outwards,
finally free of the confinement, she yelped slightly and looked forward,
luckily able to catch the bra as it fell midair towards the tub. It
floated in mid-air, however, as Nissa had not caught it with her hands.
She smiled. "I\'m getting better at this!" She clapped her hands giddily
and gave a little jump, feeling her tits slap against each other, and
her navel. The sensation broke her concentration and the bra fell, but
she had pulled it back enough that it would land on the floor near the
tub, if just barely. \
\
And with that, she slid off her panties off her massive hips and rear,
sauntering over to the tub. She put a toe in, jerking back with a light
"ah!", the hot water a shock to her system. She slowly slid her foot
down, then the rest of her leg. She brought the other leg in, with a
similar process, until she was facing forwards in the tub, towards the
faucet. Lowering herself slowly, she felt her plush bottom come in
contact with the foam of the bubbles, then with water. Jerking her head
back, Nissa resisted another shout before plunging herself down into the
tub. She squeezed her hips down, her booty being a bit of a tight fit in
the slightly narrow tub. But after a small muted "thunk", her ass pushed
through and rested on the bottom of the basin.\
\
The water filled for a bit longer, the suds reaching up all over her
expansive bust. She reached up and turned the faucet off, leaning back
slowly and letting out a long and relaxed sigh, letting the water cover
her whole body up to her neck, only her head and the top hills of her
bust poking up above the surface. "This is soooo nice\...I could sit in
her for hours\..."\
\
Nissa merely laid there, eyes closed and daydreaming about shows and
movies she had seen recently, when a strange tickle caught her
attention. At first she passed it off as the hot water, but the
sensation was building up too quickly to ignore. One of her eyes peeked
open to look out, seeing what the source of the sensation could be. But
nothing was there but the foam of the bubble bath and the top of her
rounded tits.\
\
"Wait\..." She muttered, taking a moment to study the fleshy, bulbous
mounds in front of her. Were they sticking out\...more? No, no, they
must just be floating or bobbing or-\
\
Her thoughts were interrupted as she watched both hills rise up out of
the water, slowly, yet noticeable to the eye. They bobbled and wobbled
in place, but even so, they were rising. The tingling in her bosom was
growing. Her boobs were growing. The thought finally connected in her
mind.\
\
"AHHHHH! Nooooooo, not again!!" Nissa cried out, wiggling in the tub in
an attempt to stand. But she couldn\'t. Her boobs were not only growing
up, but they had grown out. She hadn\'t noticed it before, but the walls
of her tits were now pressing firmly up against the sides of the tub.
Not to mention her ass had given some powerful suction, keeping her
pretty soundly planted in place without the proper leverage to get her
out. She struggled, pulling her arms up, but they were interrupted by
the same fleshy orbs that now pushed up against the ceramic walls on
each side of her. She was trapped. And her tits were now surging upwards
and away from her by the second.\
\
"Wh-what is\...why\...unnnh!" The heat mixed with the sensation in her
boobs was pleasurable, but not enough to make her lose focus. She kept
her eyes on her tits as they pushed upwards, rising up out of the water
like two fleshy moons on the horizon. They slowly took up half her
vision, then more as they grew to be as big as yoga balls. She felt more
and more water lapping against her bosom as it expanded, pushing out
towards the other side, and upwards in front of her face. They squished
up against the tops of her legs, crawling past her knees.\
\
"Oooh\..." Nissa was stricken with so many feelings. Fear. Shock.
Embarrassment (although she was all alone, she felt it nonetheless). A
slight pinching in her bosom as they continued their charge outwards,
upwards and forwards. Soon titflesh was bubbling up over the side of the
tub, oozing over its lip, while the side of her other tit smashed up
against the wall next to it. This only caused her tits to smash further
upwards, their wet, gleaming forms beginning to tower over her head and
push up against her chin.\
\
"Unnhh\...this has to stop soon! R-right\...?" Nissa muttered to
herself, feeling her bosom now crawling up over her shins. Her eyes shot
open wide when she felt something cold and metallic press up against the
front of her tit, the frigid steel making her shiver. It was the faucet.
Her tits filled the whole bathtub now. Water was overflowing and
spilling slowly from the top of the tub. Nissa shook her head, trying to
gather her thoughts. "Ok! Wh-wh-what\...could have c-caused all
th-this\..." Trying to keep her focus, Nissa looked around as much room
as she could see, her eyes finally resting upon the bubble bath bottle
placed on the edge of the sink. "Ohh\...don\'t tell me\..."\
\
Wiggling in place as much as she could, Nissa turned her head and
strained her eyes to look voer at the bottle. She concentrated hard, the
bottle lifting off from the sink and slowly drifting over to her. It
wobbled a bit in mid-air, her concentration being limited due to the
sensations raging in her tits. But it was starting to die down. Maybe it
would end soon? Nissa was hopeful that-\
\
"Oh shoot!" The bottle bumped up against her bosom on the way over,
liquid splashing out from its rim and across the surface of her swelling
orbs. She felt the pleasure and tingling multiply and her head arched
back, the growth being stimulated once more by her slip up. The
sensation made the bottle drop back down to the floor, spilling out onto
the carpet. After a sudden surge outwards, her tits now as large as
beanbag chairs, Nissa shook her head and looked back down towards the
ground, regaining enough concentration to pull the bottle up slowly near
her, placing it gently onto the tub\'s side, its back facing her. With a
bit of effort, she managed to read the writing on the back:\
\
"Treat yourself with an exfoliating and pleasing experience, only
brought to you by BBB. Reach sizes in bust you thought you could only
dream of as you soak your body in its heavenly perfume. Brought to you
by Growth Labs Industries Inc.™. All rights reserved. WARNING: For most
effective results, only use one cap of BBB. Any more will result in
unnecessary swelling."\
\
Nissa\'s eyes grew wider and wider as she read it aloud to herself. When
she finished, she let out a shriek, looking back over at her tits as the
front of them pushed firmly up against the wall in front of her. Her
legs were being pushed down forcefully as water splashed out of the tub.
"Ooh, when will it stop?! P-please just\...nnn!" Her left tit crawled up
the wall next to her gradually, while the other slowly inched its way
down the other side of the tub, the front pushing up and squeezing
against the rim of the ceramic surface, as well as the opposing wall.
Nissa was now getting pressed up against the wall behind her, her back
slipping up more and more as her bust dominated the area in front of
her. It smushed up against her face more and more\...she thought she
would suffocate\...\
\
And then it stopped.\
\
Nissa opened up an eye, the side of her face jammed up against both of
her tits. She rubbed it a bit, feeling no more movement or growth coming
from the mammoth orbs attached to her. As she sat there, helpless, she
could feel so many things at once. The wall to her side. The faucet
across from her, as well as the wall. Her legs. Her arms. The entire
bathtub. All with her tits. As well as the soft plush carpet that she
kept on the side of the tub when she stepped out.  Now she couldn\'t
move an inch. She was trapped by her own tits in a tub. So she did the
only thing she could think of.\
\
"H-HEEELP!" Crying out as loud as she could with tits pushing up hard
against her lungs, Nissa cried out several times for assistance, her
petite voice carrying an intense sound of panic. "SAKURA! M-MANO! HELP
ME!" After a solid minute or so of screaming as loud as she could, Nissa
finally quieted. Tears started to stream down her face. Would she be
trapped in this tub forever? A prisoner of her own giant tits? She
rubbed the giant surface up and down at its base. Her arms could barely
move, but she could still feel the soft plush of its surface.\
\
Suddenly, the door of the bathroom slammed open.\
\
"WHAT\'S ALL THE RAC-oh." Nissa recognized the voice immediately.\
\
"M-Mano? Is that you?" She could hear the redhead sigh from the other
side of the bathroom.\
\
"You too, eh megabutt? Jeeze, you two really know how to time this
shit\..."\
\
"Wh-what do you-"\
\
"Don\'t worry about it, Tiff\'s already here. I\'ll go get her."\
\
"O-oh\...um\...th-thank you Mano\..." There was no response. She had
already left. Not long after she heard people shouting at one another as
they approached the open doorway.\
\
"\...still don\'t understand what-" The voice cut off as it got nearby.
Nissa looked over and saw the crimson-haired spellcrafter in the
doorway. Nissa did her best to smile.\
\
"\...hi Tiffany\..." She muttered. Tiffany groaned, rubbing her face a
bit in frustration.\
\
"\...its one of those days, I suppose. Mano, go keep an eye on Sakura
for me."\
\
"She\'s doing fiiiiine-"\
\
"Just\...go, please. Thank you." Mano did as she was told, adjusting her
reducer bra before sauntering back down the hallway. Tiffany stepped
over, shaking her head and sighing. "My, my dear. What did you get
yourself into this time?" Nissa wiggled a bit, still unable to move in
her current state.\
\
"Nnn\...the\...the bubble bath\...I used some but\...I didn\'t kn-know
what it would do!" Tiffany raised an eyebrow at the peach-haired
woman\'s words before following her gaze to the fancy bottle on the rim
of the basin. She reached out and grabbed it, observing it and reading
the back, scoffing.\
\
"THIS company again, eh?" Tiffany quickly snapped her fingers, and in an
instant, Nissa felt a cooling sensation sweep through her bosom.\
\
"OH! C-cold\..." Tiffany nodded, dumping out the remaining contents of
the bottle down the sink.\
\
"I really do need to\...schedule an appointment with these people.
Having potent growth formulas like these out in the public isn\'t really
the best idea." She sighed again, tossing the bottle in the garbage.
\"\...not to mention its not so good for my own business\...\" Tiffany
muttered. She looked over and saw Nissa\'s bust receding, already
shrunken enough for her to adjust herself back into a comfortable
sitting position.\
\
"Now you\'re going to be stuck with some of that\..." Nissa\'s head
perked up and she turned her head to Tiffany, a look of absolute
devastation across her face. "Lemme finish! You\'ll be stuck with some
of that for another 24 hours. My magic gets rid of the overdone
swelling, but the rest has to wear off on its own." Nissa let out a sigh
of relief, grasping at her tits as they continued their shrink back
down. They finally stopped at around yoga ball size.\
\
"Ooh\...24 whole hours, Tiffany?" Nissa complained, shifting up so she
could stand. Tiffany nodded, smirking, walking over to her and helping
her stand and get out of the tub. "Ooh, my legs feel like jelly!"\
\
"How long have you been in the tub?" Tiffany asked as she handed Nissa a
towel.\
\
"A\...while\..." Nissa admitted with a blush, starting to dry herself
off. Tiffany gave her enough privacy and looked away, but couldn\'t help
but sneak in a quick grope. Nissa yelped and leaped back away, almost
falling over but managing to maintain her balance.\
\
"I\'ll give that stuff one thing though\...it makes your tits damn nice
to touch!" Tiffany giggled and stepped away from the girl, leaving her
to dress. "Just rest for now dear, give it time to go down, alright?"
Nissa nodded, wrapping the towel over as much boob as she could. "And
dear?" Tiffany popped her head back around the doorway one last time.\
\
"Y-yes Tiff?"\
\
"Try to read the bottle more carefully next time you buy something.
Alright?"

CH 11: Double Stuffed

"Let\'s see here\..." Sakura muttered as she observed the book on the
table in front of her. It belonged to Tiffany, and it was apparently one
of her newer volumes. \
\
\'Everything in there is reversible, dear. 100% guaranteed!\' Tiffany
had promised Sakura when she lent it to her. She had remarked upon the
importance of learning magic if she wanted to truly prevent any other
sort of surprise growth that could happen to her in her life. Sometimes
reversals were time dependent. The sooner you stop or reverse the
growth, the less you kept. \
\
This book, however, was a lighter one with lighter spells. They could
still do some impressive things, but even if Sakura messed them up, she
knew she wouldn\'t keep an inch of it. At least, that\'s what Tiffany
had told her. Tiffany also liked to remind her how unpredictable magic
could be, and warned her to make sure that she got any spell she cast
completely correct. Or else, well\...the consequences were unknown even
to Tiffany, purely based on complete randomness.\
\
Sakura began leafing through, seeing a lot of benign spells and charms
that seemed consequence based, as well as other transformations as well.
She recalled having that conversation with Tiffany a few days ago\...\
\
"So\...why are there more than just growth spells in your books? I see
all sorts of stuff in these, but I thought you specialized in\...you
know\..."\
\
"Ahh, glad you asked, dear!" Tiffany replied while they put various
things on the shelves. "You see, these books I write are a
big\...collaboration, I guess is a way to put it. I work with various
other transformation spell crafters, and we put our collected spells
together into one book\...or several hundred books, I suppose, hehe." \
\
"Ohhh\...neat!" Sakura replied with a nod as she reached up to put
something on a high shelf. She just couldn\'t reach, however. Struggling
a bit, she plopped her heels back on the floor with a look of adorable
frustration on her face before looking down at her medicine ball boobs.
"Alright you guys, I need a hand real quick." Her tits wobbled in place
for a moment before a few translucent wisps floated from her cleavage,
hovering just in front of her face. "I need you two to put this on the
top shelf. Can you do that for me please?" Sakura asked as politely and
properly as she could. The two faceless, formless spirits hung there for
a moment before bobbing around in front of her, quickly swooshing over
to the object on the floor, lifting up onto the top shelf. After the
deed was accomplished, the quickly zoomed back into her tits with an
airy "pop". Tiffany giggled.\
\
"I\'m glad you\'re finally getting some control over those things,
dear." Tiffany spoke as she straightened up the counter.\
\
"That training with Autumn is really paying off!" Sakura said, going to
the next object and putting it on the shelf. "No weird outbursts or
chaos at all, honestly." \
\
Sakura shook her head and focused back on the task at hand, in the
present. She was going to attempt a magic spell, one she actually WANTED
to try out. If anything, just so she could perform the reversal herself.
She was getting tired of having to be rescued by Tiffany all the time.
The more reversals Sakura knew, the better. She leafed through the book
some more until she finally came upon something that caught her eye.\
\
"Double Stuffed. Simple spell that doubles the caster\'s breast size."
The words for the spell were written below it, but no talk of reversals.
Those were on a different page, it seemed. Sakura shrugged. It seemed
simple enough. Doubling her boob size did seem rather\...scary, for lack
of a better word. But she decided she was confident enough to try it
out. The reversals were right in this very same book, after all. Looking
over the words, Sakura muttered them to herself, squinting her eyes and
waiting. When nothing happened, one of her eyes opened slightly, looking
down at her breasts, then at the book.\
\
"Hmm\...maybe it needs to be read out loud? I might have just read it
wrong\..." Sakura gave herself a few more minutes before trying again,
making sure that it wasn\'t effective. She said it loudly and clearly
this time, hoping that it would be enough. Once again, nothing occurred.
She waited again, this time giving a longer wait time, but still.
Nothing.\
\
"Ugh, I thought I was better at this\...why am I only good at spells on
accident?!" Sakura cursed under her breath, stepping back out into the
living room and flopping her large ass onto the couch. It groaned as it
usually did under the weight. Weight which didn\'t effect Kura nearly at
all. She sat there for a moment, head leaned back, until she eventually
heard a voice speak up.\
\
"What\'s gotten into you, wonderpuff?" Sakura looked over, seeing Mano
standing nearby, hands on her hips. Her tits were around E cups today,
it seemed. The bra that she wore to keep them from filling up the room
with her tits tended to make her fluctuate sizes, depending on how well
it was charged.\
\
"Oh, uh\...nothing Mano. Just trying to enjoy my day off and\...relax."
Sakura stretched, her tits heaving up into the air and slowly back down
onto her rib cage. Mano chuckled.\
\
"I feel you there." She stepped over Sakura\'s legs and dropped onto the
couch as well. "Why no TV though?" She leaned down and grabbed the
remote. Sakura shrugged.\
\
"Wasn\'t feeling it." She replied, rubbing the side of her outer thigh,
scratching an itch. \
\
"Ahh. Would rather sit there and ogle your tits for the day, huh?"
Sakura immediately got flustered from this, her head whipping over to
Mano, glaring daggers at her. "I don\'t blame you, honestly. They look
preeeeeetty nice today in that tank." Blushing, Sakura brought up her
hands to cover her vast valley of cleavage. She still only managed to
cover up half of it. "Aww, why are you still embarrassed by those
things?" Mano mused, stretching out, then reaching behind her to fiddle
with the latch of her bra. As she did, her chest puffed outwards,
expanding past her E-cups into more impressive ranges. Every puff
brought out another inch, her tits eventually getting as big as her
head.\
\
"Mano? What are you doing?" The redhead chuckled as she continued to
mess with her clasp, her tits pushing out hard to match Kura\'s medicine
balls. \
\
"There. Now you\'re not alone. Right?" Mano swiveled her hips in place,
knocking into Sakura\'s own plushy posterior. "I mean\...you got me beat
as far as an ass goes\...but hey, we can be titty twins whenever you
want!" Mano said with a snide glance, wobbling them in place. Sakura
watched them jiggle for a moment before shaking her head. But she
couldn\'t help but giggle at Mano\'s behavior.\
\
"Knock it off!" Sakura said playfully, tapping Mano\'s tits with her
hand. Mano yelped and patted her hand away.\
\
"Hey, no grabsies!" Mano did the same, giving Kura a quick grope. Sakura
gave her own little yelp, returning the favor to Mano. This went on for
a bit, the two groping each other\'s tits one at a time, each letting
out coos and moans in turn. It wasn\'t until Sakura pushed back that
they realized what they were doing. Mano noticed it as well from
Sakura\'s behavior, adjusting herself and looking straight forward,
letting out a nervous cough.\
\
"So uh\..." Mano tried to diffuse the tension, rubbing her legs
nervously, trying to hide her blush. "You uh\...you doing ok\...?"\
\
"I feel\...weird\..." Sakura replied, her breath getting heavier.\
\
"Y-yeah?" Mano asked, looking over at her blue-haired friend curiously.
"W\...weird how? Like, good weird or-"\
\
"My tits feel\...I dunno, they\'re like\...tingling?" Also blushing,
Sakura observed her melons nervously, poking them slightly, feeling the
flesh give just enough to her touch. Mano almost drooled watching this,
but shook her head out of it.\
\
"Well that sounds familiar. I didn\'t do nothing though, I swear!"
Sakura shook her head.\
\
"No, I know you didn\'t\...I think its\..." She could feel the warmth
getting more intense, but it wasn\'t insanely pleasurable like she was
used to. It just felt\...comforting. This kept her from panicking, but
she was still unsure of what was happening. That is, until she felt her
shirt creaking slightly, cutting into the dead silence of the room.
"O-oh\...so it DID work\..."\
\
"Wait, what worked?" Mano asked, pushing her face towards Sakura\'s now
growing breasts. Their soft flesh suddenly gave a big puff, pushing
their way into her face. She didn\'t pull back, however. "\...they\'re
still really soft, at least." Flustered, Sakura stood up, Mano\'s head
pulling back as her friend began walking around the couch.\
\
"Ooh, I gotta get to my book, just so I can-unh!" Sakura\'s tits
suddenly made a bigger leap forwards, puffing out as big as yoga balls,
slapping against the very top of her thighs.\
\
"Holy shit, what did you do to yourself?" Mano stood as well, looking
over at her friend as she gripped her tits, now surging their way
downwards and outwards, her tits now projecting over two feet in front
of her.\
\
"I\...used a spell that would\...double the size of my tits\..." Mano\'s
jaw dropped.\
\
"Are you serious?! That\'s insane! And amazing! And really fucking hot!"
Sakura rolled her eyes.\
\
"Now is not the time, Mano. I need you\...to go into my room\...and get
the book on my desk\...please!" Mano nodded and rushed her way past
Sakura and into her bedroom. Meanwhile, all Sakura could do was watch as
her tits continued to pulse bigger and bigger. It was strange, the
growth not coming with the usual orgasm-inducing pleasure that she was
so used to. But she guessed that\'s what Tiffany also meant by "milder
spells". Soon they were knocking against her knees, but for whatever
reason, they were still growing.\
\
"C\'mon, they should be done by now! I only doubled the-" The
realization dawned upon her. She smacked her forehead and let out a
groan. "Fucking\...I read the spell twice\...it was just a slow release.
Dammit. I always do this!" Running her hand across her face, she looked
over to see Mano stepping back into the room.\
\
"Here you go, blimps." Mano handed over the book by plopping it into
Sakura\'s elongating cleavage. Giving her a brief glare, Sakura reached
in and retrieved the spellbook, and began flipping through the pages,
all the while her tits puffed out, now grazing her shins, until they
finally came to a stop. Sakura let out a sigh of relief, still leafing
through the book until she came upon the reversal section. Unfortunately
for her, it seemed much more\...complicated and intimidating than what
she was expecting.\
\
A lot of the reversal spells seemed so\...specific. Notes of time
release and forms of magic, who casted whom, charm and other various
specifics. Body weight. Height. Venn diagrams and charts with scrawlings
near them. Sakura couldn\'t help but scratch her head. Mano slid her way
behind her, her thigh pushing up against one of Sakura\'s impressive
cheeks. \
\
"\...and now you know why I never bothered to learn reversal spells. Its
like\...homework. No fun at all." Sakura continued to look through the
book, stupefied by the amount of detail going into the various spells.\
\
"This is\...intimidating, to say the least." Sakura muttered before
coming across a reversal she thought might work. "Well\...here goes
nothing\..."\
\
"Wait, Kura, you should really-" Too late. Sakura read out the spell,
and in little to no time at all, she felt her breasts pulse and shoot
out like shotguns, the sudden spurt so intense, Sakura\'s eyes nearly
rolled back into her head. Her tits slapped against the floor, eliciting
a moan from her mouth. "Dammit Sakura!" Mano tore the book from her
hands and stepped away as Sakura\'s tits jumped forth with sizes, her
shirt finally tearing to pieces. They squished against the ground and
pushed forward through the room.\
\
"Ahhhn!" Sakura screamed out, her eyes going wide in bewilderment as her
tits rose up above her peripheral vision. "Mano! Help!" She turned her
head desperately to her friend.\
\
"Uh\...um\...!" Mano leafed through the book rapidly, picking out one
that looked good enough. She read it out loud towards Sakura, making
sure she was aiming it right.\
\
"AH!" Sakura\'s hands whipped back to her ass, which puffed up suddenly,
the sides of her yoga pants splitting at the seams, bubbles of flesh
pushing out in figure eights down her thighs. "Wrong one Mano!" \
\
"Shit, shit, shit\...uuuuugh! I\'m just gonna call Tiffany!"\
\
"No!" Sakura shook her head as her tits pushed up against the wall in
front of her.\
\
"Why not? She\'s way better than both of us at this, you know that!"
Mano shouted back as Sakura\'s boobs pushed out wider than her. "You\'re
almost as big as me without my bra, now\...c\'mon!" Sakura let out a
sigh of defeat, nodding her head.\
\
"\...go ahead." She sulked as Mano whipped out her phone and made the
call, a bit of a bickering going on between the two (\'no it wasn\'t me,
dammit!\') before she hung up and sat next to her now ultra-busty
companion. They sat ass to ass, the back of Mano\'s head resting against
Sakura\'s.\
\
"Even when I\'m not the reason, you still end up getting huge." Mano
said. This made Sakura chuckle, ripples waving across her flesh. Soon
Mano joined her, and they were both laughing hard, alone in the room
together. Mano reached back and squeezed the back of Sakura\'s tit. "But
hey. Even at this size, you\'re still not alone." Sakura turned her head
slightly, looking over at her friend.\
\
"What do you-" Mano\'s hand was already at her clasp as she completely
released it. Her tits shot forward, her shirt shredding to pieces as she
reached her full, actual size. The size of full sized sedans, she felt
them push up against the opposite wall. Sakura\'s squishy rear pushed up
against Mano\'s inferior one as they were forced into standing positions
against each other.\
\
"\...ok, that probably wasn\'t the best idea." Sakura chuckled,
squirming up against her giant breasts as they now pushed up much harder
against her face.\
\
"We\'re between a wall and a soft spot." Mano giggled at her friend\'s
remark.\
\
"More like two walls, heh." They both just stood there, shooting jokes
at one another, until finally, Tiffany poofed in.\
\
"\...well, you don\'t see this every day." They could both hear her,
even from their boob encased predicament.\
\
"Tiff?" Sakura called out. Her voice was severely muffled.\
\
"I mean, I\'ve seen this once or twice before in my line of work, but
its a rare sight indeed. What did you do, dear?" Mano pulled her bra
back together at the clasp, her tits quickly shrinking back down to more
manageable sizes. Sakura, on the other hand, remained at her massive
size.\
\
"I uh\...well, a lot of things kinda went wrong\..." Just as Tiffany
pulled out the book from nearby, they heard a muffled scream from
another part of the apartment.\
\
"Was that\...Nissa?" Tiffany asked.\
\
"Ugh\...I\'ll go check on her. Probably got her ass stuck in the tub
again." Mano left the two alone. Tiffany stepped up next to Sakura,
tapping the side of her bosom.\
\
"Tell me everything you did, dear. The sooner you do, the sooner we get
you back to normal." \
\
And so, she laid it all out. The Double Stuffed spell. Using it twice.
The failed reversal. Mano\'s failed attempt that puffed her ass out.
Tiffany listened and nodded all the while.\
\
"Why did a reversal make my ass even bigger though?" Sakura asked.
Stepping to her side, performing various hand gestures and focusing,
Tiffany finished a conjuring, Sakura\'s ass deflating back down to its
still-huge size of 3 feet wide.\
\
"What did I tell you about the complexity of expansion magic, dear?"
Sakura recalled Tiffany\'s words from the other day and nodded.\
\
"R-right\..." \
\
"This sort of stuff takes time. Work. Study. If you really want to get
better at this, you have to work for it. I spent hundreds of years
getting it right, and I was the one that made most of it!"\
\
"Then why did you make it so difficult in the first place?" Tiffany
chuckled at Sakura\'s question.\
\
"Then any brain dead bimbo would be able to reverse their size. My
growth is about consequence. Its about learning a lesson. Remember why I
made it, and why its used. Aside from just getting sexier, of course."
She gave Sakura\'s ass a quick slap before putting the book in front of
her.\
\
"Do some quick study for me, dear\..." Tiffany requested, staring at
her. "Use logic. Remember what happened to you. Its not all that complex
when put into perspective\..." Right when Sakura went to say something,
Mano came back into the room.\
\
"Uhh\...we got us a situation with Nissa. She\'s kinda\...stuck in the
bath tub. With giant tits." Tiffany groaned and rolled her eyes, joining
Mano as they walked back over to the bathroom. While they were out,
Sakura focused. Concentrated. Stared at the book and looked it over. She
pulled out a spirit so it could turn the pages for her, her hands a bit
useless in her current state.\
\
"I bet you guys LOVE all the extra space in there, huh?" Sakura muttered
to the small transparent orb. She could\'ve sworn she heard it emit a
small giggle in response as it continued to turn the pages. \
\
The more she actually read, the more it seemed to fit. The height, body
weight, body mass\...she knew all this stuff, it was based on her
original size, rather than her current size. That\'s what confused her.
That\'s what probably caused her to grow bigger. It all made sense!\
\
She read off a new reversal spell. This one she was sure of. And with
that, her tits started to shrink back down to her old size. As they
reached the size of beanbag chairs, she let out a soft sigh. Even if she
wasn\'t a pro at this yet, this was a start.\
\
"That wasn\'t so hard\..." She muttered, rubbing her still shrinking
tits lovingly. "\...and these aren\'t so bad\...after all\..."\

CH 11: Growth Lotion

Another day had passed in almost the blink of an eye.

Mano sat back, sorting through her various spell books and ingredient
lists, coming across various recipes that she had been meaning to get
to, but had put off for a while. It took a lot of energy and thought to
do some of the more complicated concoctions. But now that her vacation
had rolled around, Mano was able to focus on it a bit more. She wiped
off her forehead, letting out a light sigh.

"Nice to get a break from maid duty once in a while\..." Mano muttered
as she looked down her shirt, grimacing at the sight of her deep
cleavage. Her tits were pushing past medicine balls today. Bigger than
Sakura. She needed to charge her bra tonight, or else she was gonna have
another mishap like she had last week\...

"Look on Zach\'s face was priceless, though\..." Mano said with a
giggle, setting aside another potion cookbook. She peered over all the
covers and titles, seeing the same name emblazoned across each and every
one of their surfaces: Tiffany Massing. "Shit\...she wrote so many of
these\..." Mano remembered back to when she had first learned about
Tiffany and all the things she did, and was capable of. At the time, she
thought of her nothing more than a mere cocky witch. But of course, with
all the crazy things that had happened in the past; the store, the
charms, artifacts, cursed objects, and of course, the piles upon piles
of books that Mano owned that were all written by her\...the evidence
just added up.

"\...and this was what I got for not believing her\..." Mano stated
moodily as she puffed a strand of hair away from her face, looking down
at her bulging bosom as her tank top\'s seams screamed in agony. She
stood, placing the books aside as she heard the front door open. Walking
her way down the hallway and over to the living room, she was greeted by
the hyper-exaggerated figure that was Sakura. Her three foot wide hips
just barely squeezing through the doorway, medicine ball jugs wobbling
and slapping against her body, almost shrink wrapped in a mauve t-shirt
that just barely covered her navel.

"\'Sup wonderbra. How was work?" Mano called over from the end of the
hall. Sakura looked over to her roommate and grimaced.

"Work was fine. But these tits are about to burst\..." As Sakura stepped
in, Mano could clearly hear the sloshes emitting from their round, taut
forms.

"Didn\'t milk them this morning, huh?" Sakura shook her head.

"I was gonna be late. And we both know Tiffany\'s tardiness policy."
Mano giggled at the mention of it.

"Heh. Yeah. Every minute late amounts to an inch on the bust. God,
she\'s such a bitch\..." Sakura shook her head.

"She just knows how to keep me on time\..." Sakura replied with a wry
laugh before grunting again, pulling at her t-shirt. "Now are you gonna
help me out, or what?"

\"I dunno\....its always fun to watch you fill up.\" Mano said jokingly,
tapping her chin with her index finger.

\"Mano!\" Sakura shouted, regretting her action and cradling her
ever-pressurizing bosom in her arms with care. The slightest movements
reminded her of how full they were.

\"Calm down, calm down\...I\'m just messing with you!\" Mano laughed,
heaving herself off the couch. She walked to Sakura and laid a palm on
her friend\'s overly taught bosom. \"Yow, those things are almost
burning up!\"

"They\'re working overtime\...they get like this if I don\'t treat them
right\...I\'ve kinda been ignoring them lately cuz of how busy work has
gotten\..." Sakura said, wobbling her way into the bathroom. Mano
followed her in, ready to assist her as she had done in the past.

"You talk about \'em as if they\'re living things\..." Mano noted as she
helped get Sakura\'s t-shirt off. Sakura\'s tits flopped down, wobbled
and sloshed, nips visibly erect through her ill-fitting brassiere.

"Well\...they kinda are these days\...what with the spirits and all\..."

"Ohh\...yeah\...right, those things\..." She set Sakura\'s shirt aside
and began working on her bra.

The bra was pulled tight. Sakura\'s boobs were obviously bigger from the
milk they were holding, bulging up and out of the cups not so subtly.
Once Mano managed to fight the round tanks up front and unhook the bra,
it snapped out of her hands as Sakura\'s breasts shot forwards a few
inches, still tightly round.

\"Ooooooooohh\...\" Sakura cooed as her boobs were released from
confinement and touching the cold porcelain counter top. Were the sink a
standard one and not a magically altered one, courtesy of Mano,
Sakura\'s front would have been spilling over the sides.

"Alright\...let\'s get this over with\..." Mano moved her way to the
side of Sakura, getting as good of an angle as she could get. It was a
bit of a tight fit, but it worked just as well. Mano could reach both
nips from here, albeit a bit unwieldy. Her tits pushed up against the
side of Sakura\'s, making it an awkward angle, but Mano knew how to
stretch just as well. Although it would be admittedly easier if she
wasn\'t so massive herself, Mano knew all she had to do was stimulate
Sakura\'s nips just enough so they would start producing on their own
just fine, so constant tugging wasn\'t required. She got into position,
squishing up against one of Sakura\'s meaty thighs, taking a moment to
stare down at Sakura\'s projecting booty from the side. \'Holy shit.
Sometimes I forget about how big that thing got\...\' Mano almost felt
herself sweating at this point, and she was unsure if it was just
because of the heat radiating off of Sakura\'s tits.

"You\...doing alright over there Mano\...?" Sakura asked, her voice very
clearly strained. Her capacity was full and she desperately needed to
get the milk load out. The problem with being this full, however, was
the fact that her nips no longer responded to native contact. Meaning,
her own fingers couldn\'t get the milk out of her. It was strange, and
didn\'t make that much sense to Sakura, but honestly, when did the
spirits like making any sense? Autumn had been assisting her in training
her spirits to help with that issue, but until that was all in line,
Mano and Nissa were her only options at this point.

\"You\'re radiating so much heat, its crazy.\" Mano said. Just feeling
the heat pulsing off her friend\'s breasts was enough to make the front
of Mano\'s own chest sweat, even make her face dampen a bit. \"Funny how
you can\'t milk yourself\" Mano chided before she gingerly took each of
Sakura\'s erect and engorged nipples into her fingers. She gently
massaged the pink nubs, fighting their rigidity in order to get them
flowing. Their owner couldn\'t sit still or quiet from the nipple
tweaking.

"Nnn\...ahhh\...uhnnnn!" Sakura let out naughty squeals and moans until
finally, mercifully, her tits started to lactate. It was harsh at first,
spraying like a faucet coming on for the first time, before turning into
a more gradual, steady stream, pouring out into the basin in front of
her. "Th\...thank youuuhh\...Mano\..." Sakura breathed and sighed,
leaning forward slightly into the sink as she continued to lactate.

"No problem, MooMoo\...heh\...hmm\..." Mano eyed the liquid pouring into
the sink curiously, scratching her head and thinking hard about
something. "What if\..." She spoke under her breath, her eyes glued to
the white creamy substance that started to fill up the basin.

Sakura was leaning on her boobs back and forth, making them spray more
milk with every lean and eliciting a gasp from the curvy bombshell. Her
head was back. Her eyes were shut. Her mouth hung open. She was in her
own world.

Mano took this moment and acted, pulling out a small glass vile from her
deep cleavage and dipping it in the basin. With a quick corking and wipe
she hid the warm sample back in her cleavage without Sakura even knowing
what she had done.

"You need me anymore MooMoo?" Mano asked. Sakura\'s eyes opened from the
words, looking over at her friend, then at the bottle on the counter.

"Could you\..." She lifted the bottle from the sink and handed it to
Mano. Looking it over, Mano frowned a bit. Just everyday lotion. Cherry
blossom scent.

"You can\'t handle this yourself?" Mano asked indignantly. Sakura gave
her a pout.

"It\...feels better when you do it\..." Feeling herself blush at the
statement, Mano rolled her eyes to cover it up, popping open the cap and
squeezing out some of the pink tinted cream into her palm.

\"This is going to cost ya.\" Mano said as she rubbed her lotioned hands
up quickly before she started to rub it on Sakura\'s pulsing milk tanks.

\"Oooooh c\'moooon\...!\" Sakura whined, her voice changing pitch under
Mano\'s touch.

\"No, I get the booty pillow tonight. No if, ands\...or butts,
hehe\...\" Mano snickered, nudging her hip into Sakura\'s over inflated
backside.

"Ooh\...you\'re\...really obsessed with my butt lately\..." Sakura
muttered under pants, her breath heavy from both the heavy lactation,
and Mano\'s caressing hands. Mano shrugged.

"You may hate it, but its really fucking hot. Nissa never had a booty
like this." She gave it a quick slap, watching as it jiggled
uncontrollably within its confines. This only elicited another moan, as
well as a harsh glare from Sakura. After another minute of lotion-coated
massaging, Sakura\'s tits had finally finished lactating, only dribbles
of milk leaking from her as her tits returned to a more natural, tear
drop shape.

"Thanks Mano\..." Sakura said as she pulled on a baggy t-shirt she had
lying on the hamper nearby. Mano smiled, then her smile turned into a
devilish grin.

\"Since I\'m in such a giving mood tonight, I\'ll give you a nice lil
present as incentive for my booty pillow.\" Mano snapped her fingers.

The baggy shirt was only baggy until Sakura put it on. Her over foot
wide breasts pushed its dimensions out greatly, making a tent out of the
shirt. It hugged the upper slopes of her tits while the rest draped off
the front like curtains hiding the show backstage.

Upon Mano\'s finger snap, the shirt fluttered for a moment. Then the
impression of two detached hands formed underneath the material, and
began to gently caress and massage the massive charges straining he
shirt.

"Ahhhh! Mano what the hell?!" Sakura gasped, then moaned under the mercy
of the hands as she stumbled around. Mano couldn\'t help but cackle.

"Oh chill, you know you like how that feels!" Mano continued laughing on
her way out of the bathroom, lotion bottle in hand, until she went back
into her room, closing the door behind her. "Ahh\...now then\..." She
set the lotion bottle aside on a dresser before plucking out the small
vial full of Sakura\'s fresh milk. "This stuff\...should hold some
powerful properties\...being all magic and spirity and junk\..."

\"D-damn Manoooooo!\" Sakura moaned as she attempted to remove her
shirt. The extra slack suddenly shrank and wrapped around her midsection
like a tank top.

There was no getting it off now. Mano was devious like that.

\"Uuuuugh!\" Sakura focused, fighting the haze of pleasure brought with
her boobs getting gently massaged. She popped her hips out of the
bathroom, stumbling down the hall into the kitchen. She had to eat
otherwise her spirits would drain her of everything in order to keep
making milk.

Meanwhile, Mano was looking over various potion books, finding one that
she thought looked interesting.

"So I need this\...and that\...and that\...ooh, and some of these\..."
She excitedly chattered as she plucked various other ingredients from
shelves nearby. Various liquids with complex names. Bark from rare
trees. Mystic powder she had found in Tiffany\'s shop. Everything she
needed all in one place. She tossed it into the small cauldron on her
desk, mixing it in and letting it sit for a moment before she plucked
the cork off the vial with Sakura\'s milk. "And now\...for the final
touch\..." She let the vial\'s contents spill out into the small
cauldron\...

The mixture exploded in a shower of blue and purple sparks, knocking
Mano off her chair. The reaction immediately settled however, with small
glowing blue and violet bits floating down form the vapor that hugged
the ceiling.

Mano got up and peered inside the cauldron. All she was was a iridescent
cream colored substance. She took a mixing utensil and drew up a sample.

\"Its\...lotion?\" She questioned, sniffing the sweet fragrance and
watching it run in a viscous manner off the mixer. Mano scratched her
head in confusion. "Well\...didn\'t see THAT one coming, I guess\...was
expecting more of a potion or something\..." She sighed, shaking her
head. "Well, I did flunk chemistry\..." She looked around for an empty
flask or bottle to put it in, seeing the closest container nearby being
the lotion bottle she had taken from the bathroom. She shrugged,
twisting off the cap and emptying out the other contents into the
cauldron before mixing it in. "Can\'t hurt it that much\..." After she
finished mixing it in, she poured the cauldron into the lotion bottle,
careful to make sure she didn\'t get any on herself before twisting the
cap back on and setting it aside on her nightstand. "I\'ll test this
stuff out tomorrow\...for now\..." She yawned, stretching out, tugging
at her retaining bra. "I need to charge this thing up before it pops off
me again\..."

In the living room there was a distressed moving and muffled screaming.
Sakura lay on her ass, back arched as she hugged a pillow to her face.
Every time she had tried to remove the shirt it got tighter. And the
hands would divide into smaller hands.

She was now fighting off a strong massage induced orgasm from the
rubbing of eight pairs of hands, with one pair dedicated to her nipples.

\"STUPeh\...St\....STUPID MANMMMMMMMMMMMMMM-\" Sakura pulled the pillow
to her face as she screamed out in pleasure again, kicking her legs in
frustration form her predicament. The pleasure became too much at one
point. She passed out, the hands eventually fading away after her loss
of consciousness.

"Heyy, where\'s my booty pillow?" Mano asked as she stepped out into the
living room. She looked over and saw Sakura lying on the floor, breasts
heaving up and down with her breath. Letting out a sigh, Mano mustered
up her strength and helped Sakura into her bed. "Eh. Another time, I
guess\...I need to charge the retainer bra anyways\..." Mano muttered as
she stepped back into her room, finally unhooking her bra. Her tits
thrust forward, filling up all available space until her room was
completely full of tit. Planning ahead, Mano had enchanted her furniture
to phase out into non-physical form, as to not damage anything in there
with her massive mams. She sighed, plugging her bra into a magic outlet
that Tiffany had provided, before rolling up on her tits, drifting off
to sleep.

Sakura was the first to wake in the morning. Letting out a few grunts as
she stretched out, sitting on her bed. Her shirt had returned to its
loose, tent-like appearance it had before Mano\'s curse had taken
effect. Sakura merely looked down at it and shrugged, spinning on her
massive ass and standing up from her bed. Sauntering over to the
bathroom, she started up her morning routine. She disrobed, tossing her
clothes to the side and stepping over to the bathtub. Steam flooded the
room as hot water poured into the tub, until she pulled out the plunger
in the faucet, the water taking a second before pouring from the shower
head.

Sakura put out a cautious hand, waiting until the water ran hot through
the shower to step in. Closing the glass door for privacy, she hummed a
little tune as she cleaned herself off, lathering every bit of herself
in her favorite soap. She took extra time and care with her tits,
scrubbing gently across her nips as to not set anything off. Sakura
thought about it for a moment, considering what had happened yesterday
with her lactation episode\...but she just didn\'t feel full enough to
lactate. She sighed.

"Its a vicious cycle, I guess\..." She\'d just have to ask Tiffany for a
lactate break during her shift. Its all she could ask for at this point.
After a solid 30 minute shower, Sakura finally leaned over and turned
off the water, stepping out and toweling herself off. Wrapping the towel
across her frame, it barely came down to her upper thighs, her ass
threatening to pop the cover off any second. But Sakura was a pro at
this, and knew how to wrap it just right. Leaning over to the counter,
Sakura reached out for her lotion, only for her hand to grab air.

"Huh?" Sakura looked around the area, in the cabinet below the sink, and
on the floor nearby. She huffed. "Ugh. Mano must have sneaked off with
it again. I dunno why she doesn\'t just buy some of her own\..." Sakura
walked out of the bathroom and made a bee line for Mano\'s room. Inside
the still massive Mano laid there, snoring loudly in a peaceful sleep.
Sakura took in the sight in for a moment before looking over to the end
table and seeing the familiar bottle. Luckily, the end table was the
only furniture in the room that wouldn\'t phase out when Mano got huge.
It was in a convenient enough spot to never be crushed, and it also had
her alarm clock on it. It needed to be physical at all times. More
importantly, it had what Sakura was looking for on it.

She shook her head, sighing and plucking the container from the end
table. Sakura weighed it for a moment, eyebrow cocked.

"That\'s weird\...thought I was almost out\..." She shrugged, walking
out back into the hall and towards the bathroom. "Must be a new bottle
or something. Or I\'m just imagining things again." As she stepped into
the bathroom, she bumped into another exagerrated plushy form. "Oof!"
Sakura stumbled back, as did the other figure in the room. Looking up,
Sakura saw the bra-and-panty clad figure of Nissa, brushing her hair in
the mirror. She seemed to be half awake and looked over at Sakura,
giving her a shy little smile.

"Morning Kura." Nissa mumbled. Sakura reached, or rather, bent forwards
to reach her bosom buddy in a soft hug.

\"Morning Nissa! I didn\'t even hear you come in!\" She released Nissa
from the embrace. They were both almost pushed back by their bosoms.
Nissa paused when she caught a sweet scent, following it to a bottle in
Sakura\'s left hand.

\"What\'s that Kura?\" She asked. Sakura looked down at the bottle and
grinned, popping it open.

"Its my lotion, silly. You\'ve used it before." Nissa rubbed her eyes a
bit, looking back down at the bottle.

"Oh yeahhh\..." She was obviously still half asleep. Sakura squeezed out
some of the creamy substance into her hand and lathered it up before
pressing it against her tits. Nissa sniffed and smiled, letting out a
pleasant "mmmm" as Sakura worked her boobs over. Sakura shook for a
moment, her breath wavering as she felt a new sensation. One she had
never felt when putting lotion on before.

\"OOooooOOoooooh MY! T-this stuff is really good now!\" She smiled,
getting some more lotion and rubbing another portion of her tits in the
cream. Nissa stared at her friend, mouth almost watering at the sight,
tentatively looking at Sakura, then the bottle.

\
"C-can I try?" She asked nervously, poking her fingers together cutely.
Sakura didn\'t answer immediately, still taking in the warm, pleasing
sensations that the lotion filled her with.

\"T-try it on your butt\...\" Sakura said between her light panting as
she lightly worked the lotion into every square inch of her jutting
frontage. Nissa nodded, taking the bottle, squeezing out some lotion,
and letting her hands drift back to her backside slowly, jumping when
her hands were met with plush Nissa flesh.

\"OOOOH!!! Y-you\'re Right!! Mmmmmmmm\...\" Nissa let her head lull to
the side, eyes closed, sighing happily as she began to really work the
stuff into her posterior. They both stood there, rubbing up their own
bodies with the sweet scented lotion, gripping and massaging their
squishy masses. Sakura had poured even more onto herself, while Nissa
focused more on her groping, eyes quivering even while shut as she
squeezed and pushed against her two and half foot wide caboose.

\"This is JUST what I needed before my jog today\...\" Sakura sighed
dreamily, lessening her groping. She was unconsciously wiggling and
swaying her hips beneath her, bumping into the sink and the door
alternatively.

Nissa was still in la la land, she had her butt out and chest forwards,
reaching behind herself and working every square centimeter of her round
behind. Sakura had finished up and grinned, letting her friend enjoy
herself before putting the lotion back on the sink, where it belonged.
Making sure her tits had dried completely, Sakura threw on a sports bra,
then a tight fitting tank top, before throwing on some just as tight
fitting yoga pants. Locating her shoes, she struggled to put them on
these days, but magic definitely helped when she absolutely couldn\'t
reach her feet, for whatever reason. She jogged in place a bit, feeling
the pleasant buzz from the lotion still swimming through her tits. "Ooh,
I really hope they feel like this all day\..." It wasn\'t an intense
pleasurable experience, just something very\...warm and comforting,
almost. It was tough to explain, but Sakura enjoyed it quite a bit.

Sakura tugged here and there at her outfit, making sure everything was
in place and would ride up or pop from tension. Satisfied that she
wouldn\'t pop out, she moved to her small table by the window for her
keys and phone. On a whim, she opened the window to get a good look
outside.

\"HEEEEEEEEEE!\" She quietly shrieked, backing away as cold air rushed
into her face and down her cleavage. He nipples rose to attention
lightning fast, making their iconic dome tents over the smoothness of
her fat bosom.

Sakura\'s butt stopped her at the closet door from her reeling. At the
same time the spirits in her body reacted to the temperature. Heat and a
soft orange glow began to seep from her bust, getting warmer and
brighter with each second.

\"OOooooh, c-calm down! It was j-just a breeze!\" She cooed into her
breasts, gently rubbing the sides to ease the spirit agitation within.
The warming and glow dimmed, but didn\'t dissipate. She knew, that they
knew it was cold out.

Feeling the same thing happening in her yoga pants, Sakura turned to her
closet and pulled out her newest winter workout jacket. It was a medley
of tight knit stripes of bluish silver and white, making it look grey
from a distance. It also bowed outwards from under the arms in all
directions, making the entire piece look like a fat child\'s coat with
twice the arm length needed.

She tossed it over her head, fitting the slim arms over her arms easily.
She tossed her hair out of the collar and smoothed it over her bosom,
blindly finding the corners with the zipper ends. Her arms squished into
the sides of her perky chest balloons, making them bulge forwards and
upwards a bit as she latched the zipper. She slowly brought the zipper
upwards, feeling it actually run away from her until she reached about
half way.

\"Oh what the HELL!\" Sakura shouted. She though she had gotten the
zipper bound, but she found the tracks ended 7 or 8 inches from her
collar bone, creating a wide window of jiggly flesh and a deep line of
cleavage to suck in air.

\"Mano\.....\" Sakura growled for a few moments. She would deal with
that later. Right now, her buzzing boobs needed a good bouncing and she
needed to get jogging. Stepping over to the door, she called out for
Nissa, who was still in the bathroom getting ready. "I\'m going out for
a jog, Niss! I\'ll be back later!" Sakura waited for a few moments,
hearing a shaky "o-ok!" come from the bathroom. Chuckling a bit before
shutting the door behind herself, Sakura starting pumping her legs in
place, feeling her knees just barely graze the bottom of her tits with
the motion.

She was getting used to it, at the very least. She had had her tits for
the longest time now, almost half a year. Her ass, she was still
adjusting to. She had fitted all her clothes for both sides of her,
whether by means of magic (the whole magic battery thing made that a
dangerous solution at times), or by custom ordering it from Tiffany\'s
shop. Sakura was intrigued to discover that Tiffany was actually a
pretty damn good seamstress.

"It came with the job, dear." She had told her when Sakura had lamented
about her clothes not fitting properly. "When you work with antiques and
hand-me-downs as long as I do, you need to figure out how to\...keep
them up, so to speak." Sakura shook her head, focusing back on the task
at hand. After she had warmed up a bit, her spirits still mildly
reacting to the cold (the jacket had helped calm them down), she made
her way down the steps, bounding and jiggling this way and that as she
reached the bottom.

That buzzing still hadn\'t gone away, however. Whatever that lotion did,
it was lasting for quite a while. Sakura couldn\'t complain though. It
was a nice relaxing sensation, to say the least. The question was,
however: why? Why did something that she used all the time suddenly make
her feel like this? Was it the cold? Was it the fact that she had taken
a shower beforehand? No, no, she had done all these things in the past
and it had never changed it.

Was it\...Mano? She had found the bottle in the witch\'s room. Could she
have possibly tampered with the formula somehow?

Sakura shook her head again, focusing on her light jog through the
neighborhood. That\'s the last thing she wanted to have on her mind
right now. There was a gentle breeze rolling through the reddening
trees. Tan and dead leaves littered the sidewalk. There were scarce
amounts of people today out and about. They were either bundled up or
inside because of the weather.

Over the last couple of years, the surrounding folk had gotten
\'accustomed\' to Sakura, Nissa, and Mano. That is, less starings of
astonishment and more greetings with longer than normal gazes.

Sakura was met with several of this as she thundered by, traveling to
the park which had a nice network of paths and less traffic. Her ass
quaked tremendously behind her. Her boobs remained fairly tame in her
taught jacket. She still bounced, but they weren\'t all over the place.
In fact, they seemed to lessen in bounce since she had left the
apartment.

As she neared the park, she was almost certain that she was feeling more
draft around her still slim waist as she she bobbled along. She decided
to ignore this, however, figuring it was just her clothing riding up as
she jogged. She brought her hand down and tugged on the jacket, pulling
it back over her pale stomach. But not long after the breeze kicked back
up again, chilling what felt like even more exposed abdomen. Deciding
that enough was enough, Sakura stopped on a nearby park bench and
investigated whatever was going on with her clothing.

"Mano probably enchanted the damn thing to shrink. Figures. That\'s why
it wouldn\'t zip all the way. I thought she would\'ve learned her lesson
by now!" Sakura huffed, feeling the metal zipper slowly crawl its way
downwards across the center of her bust. She tugged at the jacket again,
reaching out to the front to get at the zipper. But that was when
something dawned on her. Something horrifying. She couldn\'t reach the
zipper. Her fingers graced near it, sure, but compared to before when
she could just barely pull it up, now she couldn\'t even touch it.

"Oh no\..." Sakura muttered, squirming on the park bench. Her eyes
darted around to see if there were any passers by. Luckily, she was
alone to assess her situation.

\*tick\*

Sakura paused, hearing the slightly muffled metal noise from in front of
her

\*tick\*

Her sweater was feeling tighter. And tighter.

\*tick\*

Sakura\'s eyes widened and she froze. Her breasts had just firmly rested
on her huge thighs.

"Oh shit, I\'m really growing again!" Trying to keep herself from going
into a full-blown panic attack, Sakura weighed her options. It was
probably a good idea to book it home as fast as possible and look
through some sort of reversal spell book. This was probably just another
Mano prank, and she didn\'t understand how it worked yet.

\*tick\*

And they were still growing. She could feel them swelling out, crawling
along her thick thighs relentlessly. Getting up off her large rear with
a slight wobble, putting her hands on her still flourishing bosom,
Sakura turned on her heel and made a light dash towards home.

\*tick\*

Sakura kept her mind busy with focusing on getting back to the apartment
without being seen, as well as what could Mano have done to her.

\"And why aren\'t the spirits going nuts?\" She breathed, keeping her
pace steady as she felt volume mounting on her front slowly but
steadily. She felt the bottoms of them whacking against the crest of her
hips. They were really getting huge! And that warm feeling was still
consuming them. While it very well could be the spirits still trying to
keep her warm, there was something different about it. That\'s when she
connected the dots.

"The lotion! That\'s what\'s doing this\..." She muttered, turning a
corner, feeling her jacket still coming undone at the zipper, her flat
stomach now completely exposed, but only when her tits bounced on
upwards. The jog was definitely getting more challenging, based on size
and weight alone. Sakura grunted and heaved as she turned another
corner, when suddenly, a thought hit her. "OH NO NISSA USED SOME TOO!"
The thought hit her mind like a freight train, making her double her
pace instantly as she nearly sprinted home.

Her sprint lasted 20 feet at best. Her new volume and weight made the
gait too cumbersome, threatening to pull her on her swelling boobs. And
the last thing she needed was to get immobile with her ass pointed up.

Sakura gasped when she felt the bottoms of her boobs now bouncing off
the top of her thighs in mid jog, which slowed her down even more as she
couldn\'t get enough stride to jog. She settled for a brisk power walk,
her jugs heaving up and down and still swelling.

\"A-almost there..\" Sakura said to herself, seeing this vastness of
breast bouncing before her, wondering which part of her was wider now.
Approaching the steps, she gripped onto the hand rail, hoisting herself
up, step by step. Her knees squished up into the bottom of her tits,
making the walk much more awkward than she was used to. Each step
followed the same weird pattern, almost shuffling up the steps until she
finally reached the door of her apartment. Letting out an exasperated
sigh, Sakura stood there catching her breath, clutching onto her right
tit. She could feel the warmth permeating off their surfaces, and her
skin still felt like it was stretching outwards. She needed to get
inside, and fast.

Pushing the door open, she realized she had a new challenge to face:
getting in the door.

"Well\...here goes nothing." Sakura gently but firmly pushed herself
into the doorway. She slipped through easily at first, but slowed to a
stop.

\"OOOooooooh\...\" Sakura moaned, the intense pressure exerted on her
bosom sparking the heightened sensitivity she had since she got her
spirits. Cleavage puffed out of her widening neckline and out the bottom
of her jacket. The zipper at stopped ticking, and popping threads and
stretching had taken its place. As she pushed herself forward, the
popping got louder. The zipper pulled further down even faster, the
pressure too much for it to handle. As more and more tit squeezed its
way through the door frame, Sakura\'s eyes fluttered, feeling the
clothing on them starting to rip to shreds. But before they could fully
shred, a small \*pop\* emitted from her bosom as she was thrust forward.
Her hips almost caught on the door, but just barely managed to keep from
getting stuck, and merely helped her keep balance.

"Whew\...at least my clothes didn\'t-" 

\*tickticktickTICKBAP!\*

As if to spite her, her jacket suddenly popped to pieces falling apart
at the zipper, the piece of metal flying across the room as her jacket
split open. Only her ultra-tight tank top remained, merely a strip a
cloth that just barely covered her engorged, taut nipples. Sakura
sighed, turning her head back at her ass as she pulled it the rest of
the way into the room. After observing it some, she looked back over to
her tits. They felt like they had stopped growing. The fuzzy warm
feeling had drained from her, her boobs resting contently midway on her
plump thighs.

"\...those are definitely wider than my hips now\..." Three foot wide
hips and now her tits beat them once again. Her tits were once again
bigger than Nissa\'s.

Wait. Nissa!

"Nissa! Are you here-" Sakura stumbled a bit, a boob bouncing off the
chair nearby, then off the couch as she stumbled into the living room.
The bathroom light was on. Was Nissa still in there?!

"O-oh\...Sakura\...I was\...just getting ready\..." Nissa spoke without
looking away from the mirror.

"N-Nissa, listen\...uh\..." Sakura looked down to see her peach haired
roommate clad in a small fashionable jacket, matched with a striped tube
dress. The hem of said dress seemed to be raised dangerously up her
pronounced booty, however. Sakura was speechless. Nissa\'s butt hadn\'t
grown\...or had it? The puzzled, worried look on Nissa\'s face said it
all.

"Um\...Kura\...does my\...does my bum look bigger to you\...?" She asked
modestly, placing a hand on the side of her hip.

It was subtle. Just like with Sakura. The only sign of anything happen
was the hem of the skirt. As Nissa asked her question, the hem had been
edging upwards. The dress\'s design started to bow out even more.
stripes getting fatter and more stretched. More cheek started to peek
out.

Sakura had to take a double look at Nissa\'s legs, focused on her ass to
catch the movements. Nissa\'s thighs were gaining mass too, thigh meat
pushing in all directions from her bones.

"I\...er\..." Sakura didn\'t know how to tell her. It seemed rather
simple, just say that the lotion they put on was making them bigger. But
now, with Nissa right there nearby, the words escaped her. Instead, she
pushed herself over to the bathroom, careful not to knock anything over,
so she could get a better look. Sakura squeezed her giant tits into the
hall, feeling the sides squeezing against the walls on either side of
her. Her cleavage puffed up into her field of view, and she had to walk
past the bathroom and look back through the door in order to properly
look at her friend.

Sure enough, her eyes hadn\'t deceived her. Nissa was blowing up too,
just on the opposite side. Her hips were widening to accommodate the
growing mass of her ass cheeks, which threatened to start tearing her
tube dress apart. The dress compromised and settled on rising upwards
instead, more and more cheeks revealing as seconds went on. Nissa
pouted, rubbing the side of her hip worriedly.

"I\...I think it is. I didn\'t eat anything fatty today\...I\'ve been
watching my diet real close\...am I just imagining it? Sakura?" Sakura
sighed

\"\....no Nissa, you aren\'t imagining it. I want you to look at me
now.\" Sakura said calmly, trying to keep Nissa from freaking out.

Nissa slowly turned to look at Sakura.

\"W-why are you standing so funny out there Kura?\"

"Keep looking, Niss." Sakura replied. Nissa did as she was told, eyes
finally settling on the large mass that was Sakura\'s new bust. It
nearly filled the whole hallway! Nissa\'s eyes almost popped out of her
head, her hands flying down mechanically to her ass, squeezing her
cheeks in a panic.

"Wh-wh-what\..." Nissa still couldn\'t believe what she was seeing, or
what she was feeling. But she could clearly feel her ass slowly,
gradually puffing out of her dress, more and more of her panties being
exposed by the second, whether she believed it or not.

\"What we need to do now, is get out of this small hallway and into the
living room. Otherwise, things will be even harder.\"

Sakura said this as she slowly backed up, her boobs dragging on the
walls and letting her know that they were sensitive and loved it.

Nissa tip toed her way out, feeling the mounting girth in her skirt
shimmy and bounce with every fall as she followed the twin beachballs of
Sakura.

"S-so\...how big will I get?" Nissa asked, prodding her slowly inflating
ass as they finally made their way into the living room. She was getting
dangerously close to Sakura\'s 3 foot wide ass, and showed no signs of
stopping any time soon. Sakura had already began digging through her
stuff, trying to find the book of reversals Tiffany had let her borrow.

"Well, my boobs got twice as big as they already were, so if I would
have to guess\...the same might happen to you\..." Sakura muttered as
she finally found the book. "Aha!"

Nissa simply stood by, letting her hands roam the mountains in her skirt
as they continuously blew up like trapped water balloons. She did this
while watching her friend using her new tits as a table. Sakura wasn\'t
taking this like their usual reaction. She was way to calm. Nissa found
it unnerving, but supporting at the same time.

POW!

A large hole formed in Nissa\'s skirt with explosive power, her whole
butt jiggling as tension was relieved briefly.

"Eep!" Nissa let out a cute sound of surprise, turning her head to
assess the situation. She didn\'t know clothing could make such a sound!
But the constricting nature of her dress mixed with the mounting
pressure of her growing rump helped make her understand just how it was
possible. "Sakura huuuurry!" Nissa egged on, adjusting her weight from
leg to meaty leg.

"I\'m trying Niss, this is gonna take a sec."

"I\'m still growing though!"

"I know, I know, there\'s a lot to look over! Remember what happened
last time when I half assed it?" Sakura warned.

"O-oh\...yeah, I do remember\..." Nissa muttered under her breath,
finger scratching anxiously at the bubble of flesh pushing through the
hole in her dress.

\"Okay, okay, I think this might work\" Sakura said, having trouble
standing up from the added weight and volume. She performed the halting
spell without a flaw, turned and and looked at Nissa\'s hip. Moments
passed. Nissa still felt her hands being pushed away.

\"I-I\'m still growing Sakura!\" She said, wriggling a bit from her
butts conquest for mass. Sakura grunted and turned back to the book,
flipping madly through the pages.

"I could\'ve sworn I did that completely correct!"

"Sh-should we just call Tiffany?" Nissa suggested.

"No!" Sakura\'s abrupt outburst shocked Nissa, giving her a small jump.
Nissa could feel her ass jiggle and wobble more than usual from the
sudden leap upwards. "I\...I can do this, just\...gimme a sec\..."
Sakura turned back to the book and continued flipping through.

Nissa\'s ass was well past Sakura\'s in width. The tight material of her
dress had chose to slowly rip up the curve of her ballooning cheeks,
almost like a quiet zipper. The tearing stopped at the lack of tension
at her back. This let her huge ass stand out with the bulging gap of her
ass while the rest of the skirt hugged her hips. Her pink panties were
slowly getting swallowed by the increasing soft flesh bulging around the
garment.

\"Ok, THIS one should work!" Sakura said, using her free hand to lean on
the couch. She was careful and paid close attention to her movements,
pointing at Nissa once more. And once again, nothing seemed to change.
Nissa\'s hips were still growing, still widening. Her dress continued to
break apart at the seams. There was a look of pure nerves and horror on
her face.

"S-Sakura\...I\'m scared\...I\'m getting so\...big!" She shrieked the
last word. Her dress had finally give in. The last of the fabric finally
ripped to pieces, falling to the floor and bursting out around her.
Sakura was at a loss. She stared at Nissa\'s hips, noticing the growth
seemed to be slowing. She then noticed something.

\"Nissa, turn around.\" She said, wobbling up to Nissa with care.

Nissa nodded, taking careful steps to rotate her jiggling lower half.
Sakura bent over with a grunt, still not used to the most weight her
back as ever felt. She gingerly let her boobs press into Nissa\'s
finally done expanding ass.

\"These are literally the same size!\"

"WHAT?!" Nissa screamed, the idea finally dawning on her. Her hands run
across her bare flesh in a panic, fingers squishing and groping every
piece of ass meat she could reach. "This\...this is\...I\'ve never been
this HUGE before!" It was true. Even during Nissa\'s last growth spurt,
she had only broke 3 feet wide. Now, she was a solid 4 feet, maybe even
a few centimeters bigger than that!

"Yeah, this is nuts! You\'re finally beating me in ass size again! And I
got you beat with my tits, heh." Sakura chuckled a bit at the irony,
slapping the side of her massive tit flank jovially.

"Sakuraaaaaa! I don\'t wanna be stuck like this! Just call Tiffany and
have her fix us!" Nissa whined.

\"Alright, hold on\" Sakura said, pulling her phone from her cleavage
with a bit of a struggle. She dialed the shop number and waited, resting
her boobs on the back of the couch as she did. Finally, after a few
rings, someone picked up.

"Hey Tiff, its me. Look, uh\...Nissa and I kiiiiinda blew up again, and
I tried doing some reversals and I couldn\'t come up with anything. Do
you think you could-" Before Sakura could finish, a puff of smoke
appeared nearby them, Tiffany\'s form appearing as it settled.

"You don\'t say, dear?" The familiar British voice rang out in their
living room. Tiffany\'s eyes widened at the sight. Sakura\'s bosom was
double the size it normally was. The girl was semi-leaning on them into
he couch, no doubt from the weight

Nissa was standing to the right. she was fully erect, and her hips and
butt just exploded off her frame.

Tiffany actually let out a gasp from the surprise.

"Oh\...my. This is quite the development. I mean, I\'ve seen much bigger
of you, Sakura, obviously, but\...Nissa, that booty of yours! That is
absolutely INCREDIBLE!" Nissa blushed furiously from the words, waggling
it from side to side, feeling the weighty girth of her new bum wobble
and pull from side to side with the movement.

"Th\...thank you Tiffany. B-but\...I\...I don\'t want to be this
big\..." Nissa admitted shyly. Tiffany nodded in understanding.

"No problem dears, I can fix you up right quick. Now then, how did this
all come about? Do you know?"

\"I-I was getting ready for work and it just kinda\...started\...\"
Nissa said, looking at the planets attached to her.

\"I went for a jog and started to grow.\" Sakura said, hefting her jugs
up with her big boobed skills. Tiffany nodded again.

"Right, right, but have you surmised the CAUSE of the growth yet?"
Sakura made a grunt, moving to the side a bit, her tits swinging and
bouncing off her thighs as she moved.

"Y-yeah, it was this lotion we used\...I usually keep it in the
bathroom, but this morning it was in Mano\'s room and I sorta took it
and\...well\..."

"Ahh\...say no more. I just need Mano. Is she home right now?" Nissa
nodded.

"She\'s probably sleeping. She does that on her days off sometimes."
Tiffany walked past the two girls to the last door on the right. She
opened it up, canceling any form of magic on the door, and stepped in.
Before her was a sleeping Mano, atop her body sized breasts, sleeping
soundly in her red panties. After making a few disapproving clicks with
her tongues, she poked at the giant orb of flesh that sat beneath
Mano\'s torso.

"Hey, parade floats. Wake up. We need to talk." Mano turned and looked
over, eyes going wide as soon as Tiffany was in view.

"Oh shit."

A few minutes later, they were all in the living room. Mano in her
reducer bra, having a laughing fit from the other two\'s current size.
Tiffany glaring at her and telling her to focus. Sakura giving a similar
glare as Tiffany towards the red head. Nissa merely holding her hands
around her butt in some vain attempt to hide their true size.

"Alright, alright, explain. Just what was in that lotion in your room?"
Tiffany interrogated quickly, Mano immediately looking at her in
attention.

"Uh\...well\...you see, I was experimenting with different potions and
stuff and thought, like, \'hey, Sakura\'s milk is magic, why not try
that\...?\'" Sakura leaped from her seat, only to get a face of massive
breasts. She fell back down to her butt, jiggling all over as she rubbed
her nose.

\"You what?\" She asked calmly. Mano shrugged.

"I figured, y\'know, since you flush the stuff all the time anyways
that, y\'know, maybe I could use some and experiment a bit. I wasn\'t
actually gonna USE any of it on you! I didn\'t know what it did!"

"So what were you ACTUALLY going to do with it?" Tiffany quickly quipped
back. Mano shrugged again.

"Hell, I didn\'t even know it was gonna make lotion, I thought it\'d be
a potion. I was gonna give it to some random chick at the mall or
something and have some fun." Tiffany simply pinched the bridge of her
nose, moving her glasses upwards. Mano seemed sincere in her answer.
None of her usual habits under pressure coming out.

\"S-so this is just a\...REALLY big accident?\" Nissa asked, sitting
almost a full two feet up on the couch.

"Seems so." Tiffany replied, sighing once again as she moved away from
the red head. "What you did was severely irresponsible and downright
dumb\...but I honestly can\'t say I expected any better of you."

"Hey!" Mano went to retaliate, but thought better of it. She took the
insult in stride instead. "I told you not to take or use stuff from my
room without permission anyways, Sakura!" Mano pointed over to the
mega-busty bombshell near the couch. Sakura carefully but quickly rose
to her feet, her super massive boobs swaying in delight.

"That was MY lotion you took! You should have used a different bottle!\"
As Sakura spoke, she felt liquid stirring in her boobs. But she was far
to engrossed in the argument to give it much thought.

"Eh. Ok, I messed up too. I\'m sorry, ok? But I swear, I wasn\'t gonna
use it on either of you! If anything, it was either gonna go to the mall
or straight into the trash. I was just too tired to take care of it that
night, that\'s all." Sakura took the apology as best she could, knowing
Mano wasn\'t one to fess up to her faults all that often. The strange
sloshing got louder however, as she moved from left to right, and a
sudden pressure was building up along with the sound.

"Oh shoot! I gotta\...ugh!" With that, Sakura dashed out of the room and
towards the bathroom, smushing her way through the door and shutting it
behind her. Tiffany merely looked at the two remaining in the room and
chuckled.

"How many times have we been in this exact situation?" She asked. Mano
shrugged.

"At least, like, three times."

\"And so far, we get the same result every time, yes?" Tiffany stood
with her hands on her hips.

"Hey, I\'m trying, ok? Get off my back." Tiffany could only sigh.
Meanwhile, Sakura was grunting, positioning herself towards the bathtub
as her tits gurgled.

"Ohhh this is happening so fast! What the hell?" She struggled to keep
herself upright, adopting to hold her arms against the wall over the
tub. but as she leaned there, nothing happened. She was full, but
nothing was coming out. "Huh? But that\'s\..." She murmured, expecting a
leak or a spray or anything, but nothing happened. She just felt as full
as she could possibly get. Her tits weren\'t rounding out or getting
taut, however. They were just\...full.

\"C-c\'mon, do your thing." She whined, giving them a little shake. She
even hugged them, regretting it as they sparked pleasure through her
whole being

\"I-I HATE TO ASK THIS\...BUT CAN SOMEONE MILK ME!?\" Sakura called out
from the bathroom. A few minutes later and Nissa came squeezing in,
shuffling just barely past Sakura, her ass pressing on every possible
surface as she moved.

"Th-they all said \'not it\' before me\..."

\"T-thanks Nissa. All you need to do, I-is gently rub me down and tease
my nips\" Sakura stammered, blushing so very badly. \"T-that should be
all it takes\.....\" Sakura did her best to give Nissa room, but between
the 2 ladies most of the free space was taken up by breasts or booty.
Nissa, finally in a comfortable enough position, reached out and began
to do exactly as Sakura asked, squeezing her fingers into Sakura\'s
massive masses before making her way to her nips. She gingerly groped
them, squeezing her hands around their surfaces softly and pumping up
and down, hoping for a reaction. Her face was beet red the whole time,
the lewd action obviously not lost on her.

Sakura was biting her lip, trying her best not to moan and gasp under
her friend\'s touch. It felt ten times better than yesterday. She shook
as her hands gripped hard on the side of the tub. Despite all the right
groping and movements from Nissa, she still wouldn\'t express. Her
nipples remained bone try, despite her tits sloshing and gurgling
relentlessly.

"Wh-what\'s going on? Why won\'t I empty out?" Sakura asked
nervously. Nissa gave up, tired from her awkward position and fighting
her new ass for balance. She suppressed a giggle as she watched Sakura
reach for her nips, but her bosoms massive size kept her reach a good
foot away "Ugh\...this feels so weird. As if it wasn\'t bad enough that
I was so huge!"

"Should we ask Tiffany what\'s going on?" Nissa suggested. Sakura sighed
again, hanging her head down, her chin burying in between her tits.

"Yeah. Let\'s go."\
Mano turned to the sound of fabric running on the wall and loud
sloshing.

Nissa emerged first, having to nearly walk sideways to fit in the
hallway. She was now wearing a towel around her waist to try and keep
what modesty she could.

Sakura followed behind her, breathing heavily as her now sports jersey
clad boobs rubbed on the wall ahead of her and her ass pushed into the
wall behind her. She was sloshing so loud that it dominated all the
ambient noise.

"You\'re both a couple of extreme hourglasses now, you know that? Except
the boob queen and the booty empress retook their thrones." Mano teased,
sticking out her tongue. Tiffany, tapped her slightly, giving her a
disapproving look.

"Did everything go ok, dear?" She turned and asked them. Sakura gave her
a demure look, not sure what to tell her. She shook her head.

\"They wont express anymore.\" She gently lifted her boobs a bit and let
them drop. The sloshing was very loud. \"And I\'m even more
sensitive\...\" Tiffany cocked her head to the side, scratching at the
side of her temple in thought.

"How could that be\..." It occurred to her almost immediately after she
asked it. "Oh! The milk Mano used. It must have had some sort of adverse
effects on your milk glands!"\
\
\"Why would my own milk make me not able to express?\" Sakura asked,
glaring at her full tits in her tied top. With her arms by her side she
could feel that she didn\'t even reach their bottoms.

"Well, think about it dear. It was experimented and messed with
heavily." Tiffany gave quick glare to Mano, who was too busy staring at
the two as they stood there awkwardly, bodies radically out of
proportion. "Its the same reason that\...I probably won\'t be able to
get you back to normal."\
\
Sakura and Nissa both gaped at Tiffany. Mano rolled her eyes.

\"WHAT!?\"

"I know, I know, we\'ve been in this situation many times
before\...honestly, I\'m amused that you\'re still surprised. This was
something that was made completely independently of anything I have at
hand. Which is why I\'m sure most things you tried didn\'t work, am I
correct, dear?" She gestured at Sakura, who pouted, then nodded. "If I
had known that your milk would be used in such a\...strange manner, I
would\'ve warned you sooner. Speaking of which, where is the rest of the
stuff?"

"In the bathroom. I\'ll go get it." Nissa offered, squeezing her way
back down the hall to retrieve the bottle of remaining lotion.

"You can\'t be serious Tiff, again? This big? And milky?" Sakura
complained, bobbing her tits back and forth, the sloshing loud and
clear. Tiffany sighed. She knew exactly what Sakura was going through,
in a way.

"I know dear. This isn\'t exactly how I wanted things to pan out either.
I can\'t predict all the magic or weird things that may happen to you on
a regular basis."

"Does this happen to other women around the world? You know, with your
magic stuff and all?" Tiffany nodded assuredly.

"Maybe not as severely, but this is definitely not an uncommon
occurrence, I can assure you."

"Then why keep doing this?" Tiffany smiled at the question, brushing a
bit of her hair out of her face.

"Now that\...is a secret for another day."

CH 12: The Laundry Prank

It wasn\'t every day they got a customer like this.\
\
Most customers were rather easy. They came in, asked what something was,
Sakura would go over and explain, maybe show off how fun it could be
(pushing her own jugs up and giving a wink), and there\'d be a
transaction. Easy as that. Some got nervous and left, it happened. They
usually came back later. Some got scared and fled as soon as possible.
Those were the ones that had no idea what this shop could do. They
usually already had pretty impressive chests as well.\
\
This customer, however, was something else entirely. Sporting a rack the
size of soccer balls, she was extremely close to biting Sakura\'s head
off. And all Sakura could do was stand there, an irritated look on her
face, tapping her foot, while the woman cussed her out.\
\
"-and SECONDLY, you think I WANTED these things?! Some BITCH spiked my
FUCKING drink and-" Sakura nodded and feigned interest while the
customer vented. There wasn\'t much she could do. As much as she had
learned about reversals, she was no expert, and most of the ones she had
performed were on herself. Performing reversals on other people were a
whole other ballpark. The commotion eventually brought the red-headed
owner from the back room to the front.\
\
"May I ask what all the commotion is?" Tiffany asked, her usual British
accent present as usual. The customer silenced for a second before going
after Tiffany instead.\
\
\"I was TELLING your pet blimps here that I wanted these deflated\...or
what ever you bimbos do here. Someone spiked my drink at a party and i
blew out of my dress-\" Tiffany could see why Sakura was agitated. The
sense of entitlement, the borderline valley girl accent, the big blonde
hair, it was all coming together. Someone was getting back at her for
being a dumb bitch. \"-and lastly, just how in the nine HELLS do you
even STAY upright!?\" She asked, poking her hand into Sakura\'s perky
right bosom. \"Its like the parade was in town and you stole two of
their blimps! I need to get a picture of this!" She said with an
obnoxious laugh. \
\
Tiffany rolled her eyes. While it may have been uncommon, Tiffany saw
this sort of thing time and again throughout the years. She leaned
towards Sakura, muttering "go on back, dear, I\'ll handle this one",
leaving Sakura to sigh in relief before heading over to her usual break
area. A table surrounded by a few chairs. The table was sturdy enough to
support her beachball sized mams that she lifted and plopped onto its
surface. Their weight didn\'t bother Sakura all that much, in all
honesty, but when you had tits down to your thighs, sometimes you just
needed a break.\
\
She sat there for a second, pulling out her phone to send out some
complaints on social media, before she heard a familiar "whoosh"
nearby. \
\
"That you, Whit?" Sakura asked as she lifted her eyes from her phone,
putting it back in her pocket. The response to her question was a quick
impact on the center of her boobs, a fuzzy figure practically swimming
up the line of her cleavage and up to her face.\
\
"Hey there Blue!" \
\
\"H-hey\...\" Sakura replied, face slightly contorted from feeling of
the animated sock puppet in her cleavage, and from the blonde
customer. \
\
\"Whats up!?\" Whit inquired, flipping upside down in her cleavage and
making her whole masses wobble ever so slightly from his action. \
\
\"Just had a customer from hell\...she called me \'parade blimps\'.\"
Sakura said, resting her arms atop her bosom and supporting her head
with her crossed arms. Whit perked up and took on a more serious
posture. That is until he just slowly sank into her cleavage like a
periscope being withdrawn, all until he was out of sight. Only her
breasts moving gave a hint that she had something in motion down in her
canyon of cleavage
\"\...pfft\...heehee\...heeheeheehehh\...hahahahahahahahah! Whit
stooooop!\" Sakura began to kick her legs and laugh, patting her massive
breasts helplessly as she arched and bucked from being tickled. \
\
After a few more seconds of tickling, the sock puppet popped back out of
her cleavage and landed on her arm, giving her a big smile. Sakura
smiled back, but she still furrowed her brow. "That wasn\'t funny, you
lil bastard." She said, giving the center of his face where his nose
would be a poke. He giggled.\
\
"You laughed!" He replied, kicking his legs a bit. Sakura laid there for
a second, arms on her tits and head thinking about what had just went
down. She didn\'t hear the shouting anymore, so Tiffany had probably
dealt with the customer. She just wanted a minute to mentally recover
before getting back to work. "Do you wanna talk about it Blue?" Whit
asked, poking a yarny nub at one of her massive flesh orbs. Sakura
sighed.\
\
"Its not that big of a deal. Its just never fun to get yelled at. That
and these things are particularly heavy today for whatever reason\..."
Sakura noted, bringing her hands in to slightly lift her bosom before
letting it slip back through her fingers onto the table. It creaked
slightly, but didn\'t give.\
\
\"Were they heavy coming here?\" Whit asked, tilted his head much like a
parakeet. \
\
\"Nah\...\" Sakura simply answered as she went to drawing circles on her
airbags. Whit slipped from her arm and tried to slip under her left
teat, his little nub legs flailing for traction. Sakura rolled her eyes
and looked away, a small smile cracking. Whit then attempted to dead
lift her 2 foot wide mammary. Then again. Then again. Then again. \"Whit
stop, that tickles\" Sakura said as she pulled him out and set him on
her boob. \
\
She looked back out the window, catching sight of the blonde customer.
Sakura\'s eyes narrowed as her anger rekindled at seeing the girl.
Sakura stood, Whit disappearing down her front, and she bounced over to
the window. She stopped when she caught full sight of the girl. Her
breasts were now double the size of what she had entered with, and her
ass was even bigger. Her clothes were torn and she was frantically
trying to walk in her heels. \"Woah\...karma.\" Sakura smiled, feeling
worlds better. \
\
"Sort of. She pulled something off the shelf when I mentioned shrinking
magic and did it to herself. She was truly one of my more\...simple
minded customers."\
\
"Did you get her to pay up for that?" Sakura asked. Tiffany shrugged.\
\
"She left before I could ask. The entertainment was enough for me this
time." Sakura\'s eyebrows arched at this. Tiffany usually ran a pretty
tight business. Then again, these sorts of customers weren\'t always
common. With that, Sakura went back to sort some things out in the back,
Whit riding along.\
\
"So Blue\...you said they weren\'t heavy before you got here?" He asked.
Sakura shook her head in response.\
\
"Nope. They fill up throughout the day, remember?" Sakura replied,
giving them another shake. A dull sloshing noise could be heard from
their forms.\
\
"Ah. How do you get here anyways?" Whit asked, genuinely curious. \
\
"I walk. Driving with these things isn\'t exactly\...safe. Or easy."
Whit floated upwards in surprise.\
\
"Walk?! How can you do that?!" He asked, befuddled. Sakura looked up and
giggled.\
\
"I live right down the block in those apartments, Whit." She said,
pointing in the vague direction of her home.\
\
"Ahh, ok. So you just walk from your home here? That\'s easier than I
thought!" Sakura giggled.\
\
"Well, I DO have to use the stairs\...luckily my building is the only
second story building with a smaller staircase. Its on a hill and
all\..." Sakura muttered, not really paying attention to what she was
divulging. Whit, on the other hand, was soaking all this in. \"Its easy
coming to work than going home.\" Sakura surmised, straightening her
back and getting a big dull slosh form the big bounce on her chest. \
\
She exchanged some tomes on a mid level shelf as Whit floated onto her
shelf like butt, deep in contemplation. Blue was having weight issues.
Weight made Blue tired. Tired Blue got cranky. That was it! Whit just
had to make Blue not cranky. If Blue\'s wonderful pillows could be made
to feel good ALL the time, then she wouldn\'t be cranky! \
\
\"Its perfect!\" Whit smiled before he unintentionally tilted over and
fell down the back of Sakura\'s yoga pants, completely hidden. He was
trapped down in her panties for quite a while, wriggling around between
the soft masses of flesh, before Sakura finally noticed the motion and
plucked him out.\
\
"You get stuck again?" Sakura asked, stating the obvious. Whit sighed,
shaking his head with a wry smile. She let him go, Whit floating back up
to a shelf. An hour went by with no more disruptions. Sakura finished
sorting and setting up displays until Tiff came by with the "all clear",
letting her know it was closing time. Sakura went to the back and
gathered her things, heading out the door, the store dimming as she did
so.\
\
"You coming Whittie?" Tiffany asked as she stepped up to her attic. Whit
looked over to her, pretending to be engrossed in a book in front of
him.\
\
"Yeah, just gimme a second! I wanna finish this page real quick."
Tiffany giggled and let him be, leaving the attic open a crack for him
to enter. Once Tiffany was out of view, Whit began his plan. He swooped
down to the lower shelves, zooming through several areas until he
reached a back corner. In that corner was three shelves, all placed
together, carving out their own special section together. On all of
these shelves were potions, bottles, all different shapes, colors, and
sizes. Whit read through the tags, careful not to knock into any of them
by accident. His eyes lit up when they fell onto a small bright pink
one, the description on the tag reading "Use on surface of breasts for
increased pleasure. Can be mixed with cloth/paper/other potions for
added kick." \
\
"Perfect!" He swooped down and grabbed it, failing to read the side
effect under the last phrase he read. "CAUTION! Mixing may result in
growth. Use small amounts if mixing."\
\
Whit pulled the bottle up with him as he looked through another shelf.
He slowly read each tag again, paying attention to only the fancy
writing and none of the sterile caution writing. He smiled when he came
across a small light blue one. \"Use on skin to reduce relative weight
of target.\" The text underneath that saying "CAUTION! May cause added
jiggle. Use sparingly." Whit plucked the second bottle, careful not to
bang them together, and he zoomed out the window.\
\
The night had a slight chill to it, but summer was hanging on as hard as
it could. The lights in Sakura\'s apartments went out, and everything
went still as all three ladies went to bed. A few minutes passed in this
stillness until Whit had finally arrived, potion bottles in tow, darting
through an open window.\
\
"I think this is Blue\'s apartment\...from what she was saying
earlier\..." He floated around through rooms until he found Sakura\'s
bedroom. A large, pillowy mass projected up from the bed. One look at it
and Whit knew he had the right place.\
\
Whit couldn\'t pass up and opportunity like this. He glided to the large
mass and landed atop its projecting surface. He sprawled out on her left
most mass, feeling a bubbling deep down. She was making her milk again.
He gently vibrated from the filling before he regained sense of his
plan, and floated off and out of the room. \
\
The hallway was gently lit by a nightlight. It must have been to help
Sakura and Nissa guide their large frames without incident at night. For
Whit, it was a guide to his target. The laundry room was a smaller room
in the hallway with a normal door frame leading to the washing machine,
dryer, and all other things related to laundry. Whit was greeted by huge
colored domes with straps and frills on them. Sakura\'s clubbing bra,
Whit thought, having explored her clothes many a time, especially while
she was still in them. After he toyed with the hyper sized panties on
the strings, he floated down to the laundry basket. a pair of super huge
shirts, a massive sports bra, a huge bottom, and some smaller shorts and
panties were all that sat in the hamper. Whit set his cargo down, popped
both caps, and began to evenly pour out the contents.\
Small magic sparks shot off when the liquids met in mid pour, creating a
vapor-like bubble cloud as the potion pooled in the plastic hamper. He
got a small dust pan brush and used it as a handle, stirring the glowing
pot of potion and clothes. Once the light and smoke dissipated, he knew
his work was done. Whit was above Sakura when he realized he couldn\'t
take the empty bottles back. Tiffany would find him out. And he
couldn\'t throw them out cuz they might do something unexpected. He
looked around before hearing a feminine grunt from below. \"That\'s
it!\" Whit smiled, darting down and gently squeezing between Sakuras
perky bosom. She smiled and cooed in her sleep as Whit burrowed further
and further down until he reached the spot she never could reach.
Moments later and a slightly mid sleep giggle saw Whit emerging form the
twin peaks, sans bottles. \"No one will find them now!\"\
\
And with that, Whit flew out of the apartment and back to the shop,
undetected.\
\
\
"So are you two going to the gym or what?"\
\
Morning had arrived. Sakura and Nissa had just cleaned up, but were
still in their pjs, waiting for the dryer to finish.\
\
"Yeah. Just need our workout clothes." Sakura replied flatly, still a
bit sleepy. While she wasn\'t exactly ecstatic to ever work out with her
mams, she knew it kept her back in shape to help carry them around. "And
what are YOU getting up to today?" Sakura asked with a yawn. Mano
shrugged.\
\
"I dunno. Its my day off. I\'ll probably just head up to the cafe next
door or sumthin." She stretched, only clothed in a T-shirt and panties.
"That dryer almost done yet?"\
\
"Just about. You should really invest in some more bottoms, you know."
Sakura chided, pulling open the small door on the front of the dryer to
check if the clothes were done.\
\
\"I don\'t have a world class fat ass like you and Nissa. I\'m good\"
Mano replied, her words not as harsh as they sounded at first. Mano was
met with a toasty set of shorts being thrown in her face. \"WHA! Hot!\"
She cried out while pulling her shorts from her face. \
\
\"Be nice now.\" Sakura grinned, patting her ass. \"We can hip check
like a horse with these butts.\" \
\
"Yeah, yeah\...tell me about it\..." Mano muttered, tossing her shorts
on her shoulder.\
\
"Kuraaaa! Are my workout pants ready yet?" Nissa called from her
bedroom.\
\
"Yep, just finished drying Niss!" Sakura called back, taking the pile of
clothes with her over to Nissa\'s bedroom. "Here." She stated, handing
over a pair of yoga pants. They were white, with two stripes of blue
running down both sides of the leg. Along with the pants was a light
pink tank top. Their clothes probably looked so odd to others while they
weren\'t wearing them. They all had extra fabric and broadness in the
places that desperately needed it.\
\
"Thank you Kura!" Nissa said with her usual bright timbre. She took them
and set them on the bed as Sakura stepped out and headed to her own
room, ready to change.\
\
Sakura pushed her dominating chest into her room with her laundry laid
out across her swells. She popped her ass in and got to work changing
clothes. Sakura\'s pjs came off with ease thanks to magic. This let her
just have to fish her arms and legs out of her night clothes. Sakura
replaced her over-worked panties with a fresh pair, patting her big butt
for emphasis to make her the garments were in place and holding. Next
came the yoga pants. Reinforced like Nissa\'s, but not to the same
degree. Light blue with a yellow lightning zigzag running down the
thighs. Sakura got her feet in, then rested her bust on the bed to keep
from tipping over. She had to slowly work them up. Her magic wasn\'t
strong enough to put on the necessary force for donning tight clothes.\
Thus she had to sway back and forth, working her thighs and ass into the
workout bottoms. Once her legs were covered, she began to stuff her butt
into her pants. She arched back while still laying on her bed bound
boobs, tip toeing to get her but arched up and making her reach more
effective. She puled alternately at her left hip, then right hip. This
slowly got her yoga pants to creep up her bulbous cheeks, slipping over
the crest and finally pulled into position on her table like hips. She
worked them up further, where their hem cinched around her waist. Unlike
her usual bottom flashing work pants, these kept her ass decent in
public. She got a few too many reminders about public decency. \
\
Next came her sports bra. It was a meshwork of strong fibers, strategic
padding, and extremely strong yet comfortable straps. She picked her
bust up and set it down in the open garment, willing the straps to her.
She clasped the bottoms straps, creating the base band across her back.
They fastened via hooks. Next came the shoulder straps, which crossed
each other behind her neck and created an x over her back, latching both
the base hooks. She adjusted her tits flesh, pushing and prodding until
she felt her breasts comfortably packed and supported. Cleavage bulged
out the vast open neckline and her tits slopes puffed up like distressed
marshmallows, quivering at her small movements. She ended with a white
tank top, one that Tiffany enchanted so she could fit it over her bust.
It streeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeetched over her breasts, easily reaching over 4
feet to get all of her bosom before it pulled in under her mams,
narrowing her profile to show where her body was tight and where it was
plush.\
\
With all her dressing done, Sakura squeezed her way back out of her room
and to the living room. Waiting for her was Nissa, who had gotten
dressed in her own outfit.\
\
"Ready?" Sakura asked, grabbing her phone off the table and slipping it
in the hem of her pants. Something strange was jingling around her
bosom, but she chose to ignore it for now. It wouldn\'t be the first
time she had lost something down there. \
\
Nissa nodded, and with that, they made their way out the door and for a
walk to the gym, their usual warm up before the big workout. Both ladies
sauntered down the sidewalk, hips swaying and wobbling tantalizingly.
Their tits were restrained by their sports bras, however they didn\'t
flatten out or misshapen as sports bras usually tended to do. They kept
their round perky shape, and only slightly wobbled while walking.
Jogging or running was something else entirely, however.\
\
Their walk down the street brought eyes towards their figures, but
people didn\'t stare all that often. Men usually got their looks in, but
the surprise that they once usually got from their enormous figures
seemed to have diminished over the past few months. The usual neighbors
greeted them in a friendly manner, and they greeted back. Somehow,
someway, their bodies were just accepted and normalized by the ladies
around them\
\
Sakura also couldn\'t help but notice the average cup size increasing in
their community each time Nissa and her made their biweekly gym trips.
Tiffany must have been really having an effect on their community. It
might also explain why so many were totally accepting of their figures.\
\
With the walk out of the way, Nissa and Sakura made their way into the
gym, ready for their workouts.\
\
The front doors shuddered as Nissa popped in. Her ass always caught the
sliding glass doors, as did Sakura\'s bust. Tim, the receptionist, waved
eagerly at the overly expanded ladies, having graduated from a lustful
1000 mile stare to a bashful but happy wave. Nissa smiled and waved
back, sending her boobs and booty wobbling horizontally. Sakura smiled
and winked, which made him turn an even deeper shade of red. He ogled
their breasts as they swayed side to side like pendulums on their
chests, then their overly full ballooned bottoms swished back and forth,
like a pair of massive marshmallows fighting each other to escape their
yoga pants.\
\
By now Sakura was a well known regular. Nissa was a bit more of an
elusive creature to the gym. They both got the same amount of attention.
Other regulars greeted them, non-regulars getting their greetings and
stares in as the girls bounced by. \
\
They both made a beeline to their preferred workout equipment: the
treadmills. Like most gyms, several rows of treadmills were lined up in
unison, and luckily for Sakura and Nissa, they were conveniently
designed to handle their incredible dimensions (a factor that came into
the decision of their membership). Before stepping on, they did their
usual stretches. Sakura lifted her leg, feeling her foot squish into the
plush of her rear as she pulled at it. It was a tad awkward, but Sakura
was so used to doing it that she could pull it off, no problem. Nissa
couldn\'t attempt such a feat, her own dimensions fighting against her
too much, so she settled for leaning to the sides, pressing her hands
against a plushy thigh as she gave her calves a good stretch.\
\
With all the preliminaries out of the way, they hopped onto their
respective treadmills, the machines letting out slight creaks under
their weight.\
\
\"We\'ll go easy on your pontoons today.\" Sakura said, instructing
Nissa to set the treadmill to level 3. Their hips began to gyrate at the
brisk pace set by the machines. Faster than their stroll to the gym, but
slow enough to keep them form bouncing into a jog and wobbling out of
control. Sakura\'s machine had 2 large arm rests with wide trays where
the arm supports would be. Her boobs were supported by this to keep them
in check. This also let her run with ease, but she wasn\'t up for
fighting her butt for speed.\
\
Nissa\'s machine had what looked like bicycle handle bars for arm
supports. this kept her hips clear of banging on anything as she gyrated
dramatically to get her walk moving. Both girls took note that the
female population was rather stacked up stairs and down. Almost all the
women had an hourglass figure of some kind. Largest set of breasts were
a tad bigger than basketballs. Biggest ass was a pair of medicine balls.
This both reduced the attention on the plush pair, but also magnified it
at the same time.\
\
"You think Tiffany has been getting around?" Sakura joked, noting the
curvy women around them to Nissa. Nissa glanced to her sides to look,
stumbling a bit, but maintaining her balance on the machine.\
\
"W-well\...yeah\...she\'s been in this town for a while now\..." She
replied, her hips swaying with her movements, pants lightly creaking
from the movement. Sakura let out a slight chuckle and brought her focus
back to her workout. The heat in her body was ramping up as the minutes
went by. She could feel the calories just burning off her by the minute.
Sakura always enjoyed the feeling in some way. Nissa, on the other hand,
absolutely hated to sweat, the feeling being the worst part of
exercising for her.\
\
\"Why isn\'t it cooler in here?\" Nissa whined, wiping her brow for the
second time in the last minute. \
\
\"Any colder and the \'headlights\' will go on. We wouldn\'t have the
luxury of even noticing, being huge.\" Sakura said, patting her front
pillows and making them quiver happily. She could have sworn she felt
two objects in her cleavage shifting as they moved but she ignored that
feeling as she felt her milk sloshing about from her workout. \"And be
glad you aren\'t a cow.\" Sakura added. \
\
Nissa sighed, and nodded, wiping off her forehead again and taking a sip
from her water bottle. The two kept at it for a while, putting a good
five minutes into their workout, when suddenly, things began to change.\
\
Hidden under the heat of the workout, a tingle grew inside both of their
bosoms, spreading quickly throughout them. As their tits wobbled and
bounced from their movements, a more alien movement happened underneath
their workout shirts, undetected by either of the ladies. They kept
their workouts going, sweating and breathing heavily, as their chests
suddenly began to change right under their noses. Slowly, deliberately,
and eagerly. Their machines creaked even more from their movements as
their tits plumped up at a slow, deliberate rate. Both of their
attention were drawn to the TV as they kept on going, slowly ballooning
right there without even a twinge of pleasure.\
\
\"Why cant they put on something good? Why is it always the news or
reality TV?\" Sakura grumbled as she went for a water bottle in her
cleavage. Instead she was met with flesh. Soft, perky, abundant flesh.
Much too soon and much too\....much. She looked down and nearly shrieked
at the swollen balloons that were her breasts. \
\
As she looked, she stopped her walk and shut down the treadmill, her
butt still bobbling behind her. Her breasts were just visibly growing at
steady rate, rising like bread in the oven Why hadn\'t she felt
anything? Her hands came up to the plumping masses, and the tingled
roared under her touch, making her gasp and weaken in the knees. \
\
\"Niss-\" Sakura said but stopped, not wanting to draw attention to her
growth. Instead she was met with Nissa looking back at her in disbelief,
while her own former medicine balls were inflating at a matching pace. \
\
Sakura\'s old beach balls were now a thing of the past. The crest of her
breasts were now slowly crawling down her thighs, past their old
mid-thigh resting spot and down towards her knees, their tops pushing up
towards her chin. Nissa, on the other hand, had nearly reached yoga
balls in size, their growth steady as well, and not letting up.\
\
Nissa had stopped her treadmill to get a look at herself as well,
following Sakura\'s own example. Nissa looked behind herself to see if
anyone had noticed, her eyes nearly popping out of her head as she
witnessed masses that now crossed her peripheral vision.\
\
Nissa\'s ass was actually slowing its growth, after having put another
foot to her already cruise ship width. Like party balloons on a hand
pump, it pushed, and pushed, each push diminishing but still adding size
to her mega ass. Her machine creaked and gave a loud snap. The track had
broken. Nissa was too much in shock looking at the beach balls of cheeks
she was toting now. A louder pop drove her to look back at Sakura. \
\
Sakura\'s own ass had also made some changes, although not nearly as
drastic as Nissa\'s. Her hips now spread out 3 and a half feet wide,
with her massive table booty in tow. Her tits, on the other hand, were
making the true gains. \
\
Her own treadmill had snapped under the weight of her tits, their forms
now brushing past her knees, and growing still. Blue eyes bulging,
Sakura\'s mouth laid agape in absolute shock as she felt their forms
bumping against the tops of her ankles. The growth was slowing, but the
damage had certainly been done.\
\
It wasn\'t as if it was a massive change. It was the fact that they were
out in public, on treadmills that had just collapsed under their weight,
in tight, strained outfits. That\'s what made this all the more
surprising. And embarrassing. \
\
Sakura pulled her boobs away form the broken machine and stepped down.
The new weight of her bounce pulled her forwards immediately and she
rolled atop her boobs.43ew Now the pleasure hit. She was so sensitive
her tensing is what saved her from giving out a deep sexy moan. \
\
\"H-heeeeeeeeeelp\...\" Was all she could whisper as she shook her blown
up ass atop her massive bean bag breasts. Nissa stepped back as well,
her arms pinwheeling for a moment before she fell backwards onto her
mega beachball ass, wobbling and bouncing off of it. She had stopped
swelling, only for her tits to rest in her lap fully as she sat on her
butt. She glanced over at Sakura, who had managed to get back up on her
feet.\
\
"K-Kura?" Nissa whispered, noticing people were starting to come over to
where they were, likely hearing the loud snapping noises. "What do we
do\...?"\
\
\"H-Hide!\" Sakura hissed, struggling to stay upright. Nissa noted that
Sakura sounded panicked, something she had not heard since they had
first met Tiffany. Sakura bounced over to Nissa and held out her arm for
Nissa to pull herself up with. The massive tits proved to be enough to
counter Nissa and get her upright. She had to hold onto Kura to keep
form falling backwards. \
\
They moved at a struggling powerwalk towards the hallway when Nissa
suddenly felt herself bounce off Sakura. Sakura\'s boobs were so big,
they extended the hallway width by nearly a foot on ether side. "Shit!"
Sakura cursed, pushing on her boobs which refused to budge into the
doorway. No matter how she twisted her body or rotated her tits, they
simply wouldn\'t fit in the narrow hall.\
\
"K-Kura! Someone is coming!" Nissa warned, hearing footsteps rounding
the corner. Nissa subconsciously pulled at her yoga pants, their added
tightness nagging at her as tingles still buzzed along her body.\
\
One of the workers walked on through the hallway threshold, failing to
notice the sweat marks on either corner as he sauntered through. His
gaze caught the sight of a large pile of towels in the corner of the
adjacent locker room. \"Ugh, stupid people can\'t pick up after
themselves\...\" he mumbled, noting how it was like two equally sized
and round piles of towels. He continued on, whistling a tune as he
entered the main gym. A stack of towels slowly rose up, revealing Nissa
using the stack as a hat. \
\
\"H-He left!!\" She whispered, her bouncing ass and bosom almost
uncontrollable.\
\
Sakura stood as well, the pile of towels sliding to her sides as she did
so. "Thank God\..." She muttered, standing up from her crouched
position. Her tits wobbled madly as she did so, Sakura having to grip
them to get them to stop, shuddering as tingles seared through her as
she did so. "Ugh! These weren\'t always this\...jiggly! The hell
happened to us?!" Sakura wondered aloud in frustration. Nissa bit her
lip, poking one of her fleshy orbs nervously.\
\
"Y-you don\'t think Tiffany had anything to do with this, do you?" Nissa
asked. Sakura shook her head.\
\
"I don\'t think so. Tiffany is pretty strict about her magic use. She
really only does it for experiments, and she always tells me about
those\...plus, why would she rope you in?" Sakura asked. Nissa merely
nodded, understanding the logic against her argument.\
\
"Th-then what about Mano?" She asked, putting the towels back neatly
behind her, fighting a bit with her tits as she did so. Sakura shook her
head again.\
\
"She hasn\'t messed with us ever since her\...episode. As far as I\'m
concerned, she\'s been scared straight\..."\
\
\"L-lets call Tiffany.\" Nissa said, worry filling up her voice like her
ass filled her yoga pants. She patted herself down, and soon began to
realize she couldn\'t find her what she was looking for. \"I cant find
my phone!\" Nissa exclaimed. Sakura began her search, but was met with
the same result. \
\
\"Oh don\'t tell me our phones are lost in our boobs?!\" She let out a
long sigh, her head arching back and her eyes closing. "Perfect. As if
this couldn\'t get any worse." \
\
"What do we do now?" Nissa asked. "Its not like we can just stay
here\...someone will find us eventually!"\
\
"We just gotta sneak out when we can, then get back to the shop. Tiff
will know what to do." Sakura reassured Nissa, trying to maintain a bit
of levelheadedness during their current crisis.\
\
"You don\'t think we\'ll\...grow\...anymore, do you?" Nissa asked, her
voice hesitant to say the word \'grow\'.\
\
There was a sudden bump noise. Like one flicking the surface of a
balloon. \"Huh?" Nissa asked, looking at Sakura. Sakura wore a look of
shock and weakening resolve as another bump came form her. Then another.
Her boobs her starting to jostle. \
\
\"S-spirits!\" Was all Sakura could say before the bumping became a
sudden storm. She held her mouth and fell to her knees behind her tits,
bucking and choking in her hands as she tried so hard not to be loud.
And then her tits pushed out again, but differently. Like a huge puff.
Then another. Like balloons. \"T-they are blowing me up!! I-I\'m getting
lighter!!\" Sakura moaned quietly, going silent as a huge orgasm ripped
thru her. \
\
Nissa merely stared for a moment, in complete disbelief as she watched
her friend swell and wobble before her. "You aren\'t gonna\...float
away, are you?" Nissa asked, bringing a hand up to her worried face.
Sakura quickly shook her head, recovering from her orgasm gradually.\
\
"Th\...they aren\'t strong enough for that\...but I\'m gonna get huge if
I don\'t get back to the shop soon\...ooooohhh\..." She moaned again,
the feeling of the spirits bouncing around within her tits being too
much for her to handle. Nissa couldn\'t do much more than stare,
watching as Sakura\'s tits soon pushed her back to her feet, their sizes
slowly covering up her face by the second.\
\
Nissa was only snapped out of her daze once she felt a pleasurable buzz
enter her own bosom.\
\
"\...oh no."\
\
Nissa\'s front began to blow up just like Sakura\'s. Small lights zipped
around under her skin as she hugged all of her round, plushy flesh that
she could. And it felt incredible. \"Ooooooooooooooh\...\" Nissa
couldn\'t help but mutter. She fell backwards onto her heavy ass and
bounced atop her cheeks like bouncy castles. Her own boobs puffed up and
up, rising higher and higher above her each time. And she could still
see the massive swells of Sakura passed her own bosom. \"T-they feel too
goooooooood!" Nissa exclaimed. "Sakuraaaaa\...we\'re getting HUGE!"
Nissa stated, feeling her tits crawl down her bloated thighs and to her
knees. Sakura\'s own tits were taking up more and more room within the
packed locker room as the spirits continued their merciless growth
within them, their forms nearing the ceiling. \
\
"Nnnnn\...gotta\...try\...something\..." Sakura muttered. She had never
done anything like it before. She had tried and gotten pretty far, but
doing it this amount of distance was a bit of a risk. But at this point,
they had to take it. Sakura concentrated as hard as she could, a feeling
of weightlessness going throughout her body, added onto the already
lightness in her boobs. Nissa could feel the same sensation as it grew
and grew. The room got blurry. The world around them seemed to dissolve
as everything got quiet until.\
\
PLOP!\
\
The pair landed within an antique shop, setting a few items crashing to
their sides. Luckily nothing breakable, and nothing landed in their
bosoms this time, as had happened many times before. Sakura let out a
deep sigh of relief. She had successfully teleported not only herself,
but another person for the first time! At least long distance, anyways.\
\
One catch however.\
\
"Eek! Kura, why am I only in my undies?!" Nissa screeched.\
\
Unfortunately for the both of them, their exercise attire seemed to be
left behind at the gym, leaving them only in their bra and panties. She
looked down at Nissa to her left, seeing her overly hourglassed friend
toting knee level breasts. Lights still zipped about her boobs, but it
looked like she had stopped growing. Sakura was still swelling, and the
ceiling had never been in arms reach before. \
\
"Oh gosh, I really hope this isn\'t permanent\..." Nissa muttered,
feeling the spirits suddenly leave her own tits and fly back into
Sakura\'s. The addition only bumped up Sakura\'s growth rate, her body
and a half sized tits going for full double body sized now. Nissa\'s
tits remained at their knee-knocking size, wobbling and jiggling madly
with every move. Nissa shuddered, suddenly remembering how big her ass
had gotten as well. She reached back and felt her new caboose, gasping
as the flesh came in contact with her plush posterior. Covered only in
panties that somehow fit her new size, Nissa\'s ass lit up in pleasure
as her fingers brushed across bare skin, causing gasps and light moans
to emit from the peach haired woman. Nissa\'s knees weakened and she
fought to stay standing. Her huge ass bobbled and swayed about like
agitated jello and balloons taped to the wall. That was how much extra
flesh was packed on her tail-end. The bouncing, jiggle, and swaying was
too much. Nissa fell onto her boobs, stuck her massive ass out and
gripped into the meat as hard as she could, forcing her over the edge
into a massive orgasm of her own. \
\
With a final puff, Sakura breasts came to a sudden halt in growth. Then,
ever so gently, her breasts left the floor, only to make contact with
the ceiling moments later, with poor Kura trapped behind them.\
\
\"HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEFFFFFF! NIIIIIFFFFAAAAA!\" The faint sound of
Sakura\'s voice was tremendously muffled by her floating weather
balloons. They hovered ominously a foot off the floor, gently quivering
as their owner fought them in every way she could. It only fueled how
amazing the ceiling felt on her bare flesh, making her moan and shudder
in her own cleavage cavern. \
\
"What in the hell is with all the\..." A familiar accent broke through
all the chaos, the redheaded shopkeeper turning the corner to witness
the scene in front of her. All she could do was stare at it and
eventually sigh. "\...is there ever gonna be a month where this doesn\'t
happen, dears, or should I just start expecting this now?" \
\
\"Tiffany!\" Nissa cried, still kneading her massive bust as it propped
her up. \"H-help!\" Nissa looked miserable as she couldn\'t stop playing
with her pillows. It was obvious it felt way too good to just lay on
them.\
\
\"TFFFFFF NNN GRRRRRRRRRRRNNNNNNNNNNN!\" Sakura cried out, barely
audible passed her gigantic tits. And barely, just barely, they were
inching outwards along the ceiling and towards the floor. This sliding
was driving Sakura absolutely wild as she bucked behind her bust
walls. \
\
"Yeah, yeah, I\'m on it\..." Tiffany replied with an unenthusiastic
tone. "Gotta figure out how this all went down first. Any weird foods
recently, dears? New clothes? Misfired spells?" She asked as she studied
Nissa over, her nose wrinkling as soon as she got close. "Oh goodness,
that is one strong magical stench." She pinched her nose with one hand
and waved her hand with the other. She then stepped forward towards
Sakura, sensing something was up. As her tits floated there, she could
see something glint from their forms from where she was standing. With a
simple snap, the objects appeared in her hands: two small glass
containers, each with their own labels. Tiffany let out a sigh. "I know
exactly what did this. As for all the floating, you\'ll have to corral
those spirits of yours yourself, dear." Tiffany called over to Sakura as
she left to go get some tools to help the two bloated ladies.\
\
Nissa waggled her discomfort about, wobbling this way and that, bouncing
atop her huge tits. Everything felt so good being so large that it
scared her. She couldn\'t function like this. Her already gratuitous
image couldn\'t be upgraded past fetish levels. She would be laughed
at!\
\
Sakura on the other hand was too busy trying to control the swarm of
spirits in her breasts. Any friction pumped her up bigger and would
weaken her control over them. She floated down a few inches, but the
minute she brushed on something she pumped up bigger and rose right back
to the roof, orgasming as she hit the ceiling. By now there was less
than a foot between the floor and her tits.\
\
Tiffany rounded the corner again, supplies in hand as she looked over
the women, giving Sakura a skeptic look.\
\
"Having trouble, dear?" She asked as she set a book aside. Along with
the book was a brass saucer with a copper cruet, which seemed to be full
from the sound of it, as well as several mysterious ingredients set on a
separate plate. "Those spirits giving you that much of an issue? I can
perform a temporary exorcism if you want, but it\'ll only be a band-aid
for now."\
\
A quiet \'yes\' was all Tiffany could hear before a stifled moan,
Kura\'s tits now pressed on the floor and ceiling at the same time.
Tiffany chuckled and pulled out a small white slip of paper, slapping it
onto Sakura\'s tits. On it was a strange symbol which glowed briefly,
all the pleasure and chaos swirling within Sakura\'s tits finally
calming all at once.\
\
\"Well now that THAT pair of problems has been halted, I can get to
FIXING this. Well\...mostly.\" Tiffany said, prepping her tool and
ingredients for the girls. Nissa turned her head at the words, face
going stony. \
\
"Wh\...what do you mean\...\'mostly\'?" She asked in a low quiet voice,
her hands still rubbing across the veritable amount of flesh spread out
from beneath her, ass still wobbling slightly from every movement she
made.\
\
\"This is probably not going away dear. At all.\" Tiffany simply said.
She stirred the substances within the cruet for a moment, snapped her
fingers, and made pink explosive blast out of the object. She then
poured the liquid out of the cruet and into a separate glass and handed
it to Nissa. \"Drink.\" \
\
"B-but if its not going away, then\...why-"\
\
"Drink, dear. You don\'t really have time to ask questions here."
Tiffany stated flatly before picking up another glass and pouring more
of the substance for Sakura. She had slowly started deflating, the
spirits calm enough for Sakura to gain control over. Her tits now slowly
floated towards the ground now, settling as she went back down past
couch sized tits and to body sized. "Here you are, dear. Drink up." Both
girls sipped and spat a bit, but pressed on through the nasty taste of
the concoction. They followed with some sputtering and coughing.
\"W-what happened Tiff? Why did we grow so HUGE!?\" Sakura asked as she
eyed the slopes of her tits in front of her face.\
\
"Well, to put it simply: your clothes were spiked." Sakura and Nissa
both looked at her, dumbfounded.\
\
"WHAT?!" They exclaimed together.\
\
"Yup. Some prankster must\'ve put some potions in your clothes or
laundry or something. I could tell just by the smell that it was some of
my stuff mixed with\...whatever laundry detergent you both use."\
\
"Huh. I thought our clothes smelled a bit\...off\..." Sakura muttered.\
\
"Now, I know its not Mano who pulled that off, cuz she hasn\'t been in
my shop in weeks, and the only thing that could\'ve had this specific
reaction is potions. But I do have some idea\..." She side-glanced to a
 shelf where a small orange ball of yarn was peeking out from behind a
curio.\
\
Sakura suddenly perked up with realization. \
\
\"WHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT!\" She screamed,
standing up and making her mountains quiver. Before she could do
anything, however, Tiffany had reached her hand outwards, the sock
puppet suddenly flinging out from the shelf and into her open palm,
which she closed around his head. She pulled him up to her face and
glared at him.\
\
"And did you think you could get away with that?" Tiffany asked, a very
obvious venom in her voice. Whit looked terrified. As did Sakura. Sakura
had seen Tiffany upset before, but something was\...different about
this. The room was dead quiet before Whit finally spoke up.\
\
"Er\...well\...Blue was talking about\...well, she\'s been kind of in a
bad mood lately\...so I thought, why not make her pillows feel really
goo-" Tiffany shook him by the head suddenly, shutting Whit up
immediately.\
\
"Listen. Hun. We\'ve been over this. You cannot, I repeat, CANNOT, use
MY product without my permission. Understand?" The sock puppet was
shaking, but managed a little nod. Tiffany let out yet another sigh.
"You\'re lucky I love you, hun." She then gently placed him within her
cleavage, pushing him down until he was out of sight.\
\
No one spoke for a moment, the air still iced from Tiffany\'s outburst.
Nissa finally spoke up. \"S-so what now?\" \
\
"Yeah Tiff\...what was that stuff you made us drink\...and what is it
gonna do for us?" Sakura asked, still leaning on her bust awkwardly.\
\
"Well\...it\'ll help a bit\...maybe. Its a bit of a difficult thing to
explain. I know it\'ll dull the pleasure down significantly for those
things, but reducing the growth\...may or may not happen, at least not
all the way." Tiffany admitted, setting some of her tools aside.\
\
On cue, both girls could feel before seeing the deflation of their
expanded bits. Sakura watched as the shop reappeared before her. Her
tits deflated continuously. She suddenly leaned forward and fell on her
boobs as they shrank to just ankle level, taking her weight with easy
and holding her up. She bit her lip due to how amazing it felt to feel
that amount of compression. \
\
Nissa\'s ass was the star of her deflation show. It shrank behind her
like blimps being deflated for storage, slowly losing volume and
distance. She wasn\'t as lucky as it stopped at 4 1/2 feet wide, leaving
her with an ass bigger than beach balls. Nissa stared at it for a
moment, an expectant look in her face. She shook it slightly, the jiggle
very much still present within it despite its smaller size.\
\
"C\'mon\...it was\...it was smaller than this\..." Nissa muttered,
giving it a poke, feeling her finger sink into the pliable flesh of her
bottom. It only just occurred to her that her beachball tits hadn\'t
shrunk an inch.\
\
\"That\'s it. Sorry ladies, but you\'re stuck with what you see.\"
Tiffany sighed. She looked at Sakura and spotted a look of happiness
trying to be suppressed. Was she actually\...enjoying being massive now?
Tiffany grinned at the thought, but kept it to herself. The last thing
she wanted to do was ruin the feeling Sakura was having.\
\
Nissa, on the other hand, was having a very different reaction now that
she realized how much more massive her top half had become. \
\
\"This stinks\...now i can\'t do anything\...I cant sit at a desk, I
cant sit in anything, i cant see past these\...these\...planets.\" Nissa
said with a sulk before Tiffany promptly gave a quick laugh.\
\
"Oh, that\'s funny dear! You\'ll be able to do all of that just fine as
it is, trust me. Things have a way of\...adjusting, in time." Tiffany
pointed so Sakura rolling to her feet and standing up before taking a
few tentative steps, her front bobbing gently and swaying more so as she
got used to her mattress frontage. The sight made Nissa smile a bit, a
wave of relief hitting her.\
\
"Y-yeah\...I guess you\'re right\..." She muttered, grasping her butt
and slowly rolling her hands over it in circles. She blushed as soon as
she realized something, however. "Um\...c-can I get some clothes
please?"\
\
MEANWHILE\
\
At a small park near the ladies\' apartment, Mano had taken a short walk
to a nearby coffee shop, adorned in her sporty bust-controlling bra, a
tank top, and some shorts. On her way back, her favorite brew in hand,
she felt an odd tingle start to tug at her backside.\
\
"Eh?" She noticed the feeling immediately, pausing on the sidewalk and
looking behind herself, people passing her by. It was only a few moments
before she felt her bare cheeks starting to rub against the fabric of
her shorts. "What the hell?!" She shout-whispered, getting a few stares
from passerbys. This new info in mind, Mano made a quick power walk back
to the apartment, ass slowly billowing out behind her by the second.\
\
As she burst through the apartment door, her ass had made admirable
gains. Before this, Mano\'s butt had never been all that special.
Compared to her body-sized tits, her ass had always been looked over. It
now seemed as if it was trying to change that, her new size being
nothing short of a sign on her ass that read "notice me!" \
\
Mano rushed into the bathroom, flipping on the light and turning around,
her eyes going wide as she watched her butt pump up bigger and bigger by
the second, her once loose shorts now quite tight around her new cheeks,
flesh oozing out of the bottom hem by the second. \
\
"Holy shit\...h-how?!" Mano had never experienced this big of a growth
spurt in her butt before. Maybe once or twice way back a few years ago,
but nothing this\...intense or huge all at once. It started to shelf
outwards, only instilling more worry into Mano as she could only watch
as the damage was done. "Dammit\...what\'s doing this? Did I hex
something and forget about it? Is this some kind of shitty prank?" She
thought to herself out loud as she paced towards the hallway, her cheeks
tugging this way and that. Her hips now pushed out to two feet, cheeks
reaching basketball sized before the feeling finally faded away. It had
happened so quick, and somehow her shorts stayed in one piece, albeit a
very tight piece.\
\
She wanted to rush back to the bathroom, but the added weight of her new
posterior caused her to collapse sideways onto the wall next to her.
Unused to her position, she slowly slid down to the ground with a small
puff, struggling to gather herself.\
\
"Why is it so goddamn HEAVY?!" She shouted, trying her best to get some
leverage back to return to her feet. The struggle went on for a few
minutes before she finally managed to stand, albeit a bit wobbly.
"\...reminds me of when I first got these stupid tits\..." she muttered,
staring down at her basketball tits, trying to ignore the fact that she
was a perfect hourglass at this size. Her tits wouldn\'t always be
basketballs, however. In fact, they were rarely ever this small. A fresh
charge for her reducer bra always managed to get them down at least this
far. \
\
Each step brought out thunderous, weighty wobbles in her cheeks, causing
Mano to stop in place for a moment before stepping again. This slow
march eventually led her back to the bathroom where she turned her back
to her mirror. What she saw made her heart sink.\
\
Two cheeks, perfectly spherical, attached to now too-wide hips, still
wobbling in place. Even the slightest jiggles brought out small sparks
of pleasure, something Mano tried her best to ignore. She brought a hand
up to her cheek, lightly brushing across its crest and up towards her
back to confirm it was all real. It was.\
\
She could do nothing more than just stare at it for a few minutes,
rubbing across it in a daze, feeling those familiar sparks of pleasure.
After a while, she finally let out a sigh and muttered something to
herself.\
\
"\...I blame Sakura."

CH 14: The Finale.

"You know how long I\'ve been alive, dear?" Tiffany asked out of the
blue, Sakura\'s head darting up at the question.

"Er\...have you ever told me before?" Sakura asked back, unsure how to
answer. Her breasts still brushed her ankles, wobbling to and fro at
literally every movement. It had been a little over a year since Sakura
had had any major changes to her overall physique. Permanent changes,
anyways. She had gotten blown up here and there over that time, but it
never lasted. It finally felt as if her body had stabilized, something
Sakura was relatively pleased with.

"I don\'t believe so. Us Spellcrafters, dear\...well, I explained how we
work, correct?" Sakura tapped her chin a bit in thought, adjust her
tight fitting yoga pants over her massive, beach ball cheeked booty.

"Uhhh\...maybe a few things. You don\'t age though, right?" Sakura
asked, still moving various trinkets off the shelf as she dusted them
down.

"Correct. Spellcrafters, once seasoned enough, can control their age at
will."

"\...how come there aren\'t more Spellcrafters, Tiff?" It was a question
that had been on Sakura\'s mind for a while. For whatever reason, this
seemed to be the right time. Tiffany paused for a moment, lost in
thought, before answering.

"There are, dear. Just\...most of them aren\'t HERE. They\'re across the
world\...across universes, even. Most Spellcrafters get bored of Earth
as it is and choose to push out into\...the beyond."

"So\...have you ever been outside of this universe?" Sakura asked,
intrigued. Tiffany just chuckled, nodding.

"I have, dear. With how long I\'ve been around, I\'ve seen\...so much."
There was a tone in her voice Sakura didn\'t recognize. It was somber,
yet\...sentimental.

"Why did you choose Earth?" Sakura had no idea what any of these
alternate universes were, but she was curious as to why an all powerful
being like Tiffany would stay in an urban city selling antiques to
strangers. Tiffany chuckled.

"Its because\...well, humans are the best playthings, dear." It sounded
almost cruel. Her honesty was on full blast right now. And Sakura wanted
to take advantage.

"I\'ve\...been thinking lately, Tiff. And\...well, I wanted to
know\...if\...if you picked me and Nissa\...for a reason." Sakura asked
tepidly, avoiding eye contact as she did so. There was a long, drawn out
silence, followed by a sigh from Tiffany.

"Well\...it all started with your little friend Mano, dear. As you know,
that abuse of my magic was beyond a scale I had ever encountered in all
my years of the field. Not many people believe in magic anymore, I\'m
afraid. Modernization and all that. But when a human latches hold of a
specific type of magic\...and abuses it\...Spellcrafters have to
intervene at some point. Not legally or anything, its just\...there\'s
this ringing in my ears\...whenever it happens. And it just gets worse
to the point where I just need to shut it off." She paused, glancing
over at Sakura.

"You\...and Nissa both\...were unfortunately caught in that crossfire,
many times\...however, I saw potential in you both, which is why I
offered you BOTH a position here. The only difference is that Nissa
refused\...and you did not." Sakura nodded hearing all this.

"Potential, huh?" Tiffany chuckled at Sakura\'s question.

"Oh please, any woman who can walk around with beach balls hanging off
their chest just has to have some kind of\...gift, don\'t you think?"
Tiffany asked, stepping over to her assistant. "Or someone who can still
walk in spite of having a caboose that blocks doorways? That\'s a bit of
a feat, don\'t you think, hmm?" Tiffany asked with a grin. Sakura rolled
her eyes.

"Be honest with me Tiff: is there any way to get my body back to
normal?" Sakura asked, eyes looking directly at Tiffany now. Tiffany
looked back at her, puzzled, but also\...sad.

"Do you hate your body all that much, dear?" She asked, tapping the
counter.

"Well\...I mean\...sleeping was a challenge at first, but I got that
down\...I can adjust my clothes with magic\...teleport with
magic\...phase through stuff with spirits\...and I\'ve learned a few
reducer tricks these days to help when going out into public\..."

"Magic serves the purpose of the one who learns it, dear. That\'s what
I\'ve seen throughout my lifetime. As you learn more, your breasts will
never be a hindrance at all. You\'ll only reap in the benefits\..."

And Sakura had thought about the benefits. First and foremost, they felt
fantastic. Leaning into them at night before bed had become a routine,
crouching back and forth on them like they were yoga balls, sparks of
pleasure building up until she finally climaxed. It was heaven, and it
was something she could never experience before having them. And the
attention wasn\'t something she hated either admittedly. Over the year,
Sakura had accepted and even come to love her giant size. Thoughts of
going even bigger had somehow sneaked into her psyche, and she wondered
if Nissa felt the same at all\...

She hadn\'t talked to Nissa about this stuff in a while. Maybe she
should.

"I\'d say you\'ve put the hours in today, dear. I have something I need
to share with you tomorrow, so get some good rest, ok?"

"And what would that be?" Sakura asked, changing her clothes into
something more "street" appropriate: Yoga pants, a hoodie and some
sneakers. Her tits shrank down to just at her navel, a spell that only
worked until she got into her door.

"I can\'t say anything right now dear. Its a surprise. Now go on then!"
Tiffany shooed Sakura out the door. Before it shut, however, Sakura
looked back through the doorway.

"You never told me how old you were, by the way." Tiffany smiled.

"A little over 700 years old, dear. You tend to lose a bit of track
after the first 100, though. See you tomorrow, dear." And with that, the
door shut.

Sakura tossed her belongings onto the couch as her tits slowly expanded
back down to her ankles. Her ass did a similar slow blowup to its old 4
foot self.

A lot can happen in a year. Nissa had moved to a new town, pursuing
photography with a bit of modeling on the side. She visited every once
in a while, but it had been some time since they had spoke. Mano had
also moved out, finally getting her instachat altogether and getting
over ten million followers. She got paid out the nose for it, and was
living a pretty good life with Zeke. The apartment was starting to feel
lonely\...

Sakura picked up her cell phone from her cleavage and dialed.

"Hey Niss\...wanna meet up tonight? I know its last minute but-"\
\
"Of course Kura! Lemme just-" And in an instant Nissa appeared in her
living room, phone in hand. Sakura merely blinked.

"You\'ve gotten really good at that!" Sakura complimented, leaning over
and giving her busty friend a big hug. Nissa was adorned in a long,
flowing white dress, the back of it sticking out like a tent over her
massive rear end. Her tits had gone down in size considerably, reducing
by a few feet from their last incident. What were once beach balls had
reduced to medicine balls.

"So that therapy that Autumn taught you about is actually making those
go back down, eh?" Sakura asked. They always had to start with boob talk
these days, it seemed. Nissa nodded.

"Yeah, actually! Its taking quite some time, but I\'ve lost a few cup
sizes. Its made handling the camera much easier." Nissa replied, slowly
sitting down on the love seat behind her. Instead of lowering, her
height seemed to stay relatively the same.

"No word on if it will work back there yet?" Sakura asked, getting some
refreshments from the fridge. Nissa sighed.

"Nope. She said my butt just has something going on with it that makes
it immune to any treatment\..."

"Super convenient\..." Sakura muttered while grabbing a soda from the
fridge, and a sparkling water for Nissa. She took with a smile and a
polite \'thank you\'.

"So how has Tiff\'s been? Any changes?" Sakura shook her head, plopping
down on the couch and taking all the space there was to take on it with
her massive caboose.

"She\'s been asking a lot more\...questions lately, though. Getting a
bit more personal. Its definitely felt like something has been\...up.
Like, Tiff\'s been thinking about something for a while and I don\'t
know what." Nissa sipped her drink, then set it down between her
knockers.

"You think she\'s got something planned, then?" She asked, a finger to
her chin in thought.

"I don\'t know what she\'s up to\...I just hope it doesn\'t involve any
more size in the booty department. Any more and I won\'t be able to
walk!" Sakura said with a sigh, rubbing the side of her hip. While it
was true Nissa had the bigger butt between the two of them, she also had
a better height advantage. Everything was proportional in that sense,
Sakura mused. Nissa didn\'t seem to take any offense and just sipped her
drink.

"Just the booty though?" Nissa asked, gesturing to Sakura\'s front flesh
with an arched eyebrow. Sakura blushed lightly, but smiled.

" I mean\...these things don\'t really bother me that much anymore\..."
Nissa cocked her head and looked puzzled.

"\...Sakura Mizumi, are you trying to tell me that\...you\'re starting
to like your boobs that big?" Sakura\'s face suddenly popped up and went
a deeper shade of red.

"I uh\...I\..." But she couldn\'t respond. Sure they were massive,
pendulous, and got in the way. But she had control. Their weight never
even occurred to her. She was never halted by them these days. Its as if
they only really existed when she wanted them to\...for the most part.

"I mean\...do you still hate your butt as much these days?" Sakura asked
back. Nissa, looked back at her booty and sighed.

"I\...if I could shrink it, I would. I dunno how you stand them,
Sakura." Sakura nodded. It made sense. Even before this whole debacle,
when Mano was just changing them for funsies, before Tiff had come
around, Sakura always did have a part of her that loved how big she was.
It was just\...further away than it was now.

"\...you seen what Mano\'s been up to lately? After that shoot you did
with her?" Nissa lit up at this question.

"I saw! She\'s all the way on the west coast now! She seems so happy!
Her career REALLY took off out of nowhere!" Sakura snickered.

"Well with tits and ass like that, I suppose that was inevitable, huh?"
Sakura\'s tits heaved after she let out a sigh, their forms resting
softly against her legs.

The two of them chatted on for a few hours before it got late, then said
their goodbyes.

"It was nice catching up!" Nissa said with a big hug, their busts
squeezing together close. The spirits stirred at the feeling, but Sakura
had long learned how to control them by now, with a lot of intensive
Autumn training.

"You too! Keep kicking ass out there, Niss." Sakura said, pumping a fist
up. Nissa just giggled and thanked her before warping back out.

And with that, Sakura began her sleeping ritual.

After a long, hot shower, she stood in her room only wearing a bra and
panties. She wobbled to her bed, plunging onto her knees and leaning
forward into her bust. The feeling was instantaneous. The tingles washed
over her bust like an ocean wave, bringing her to breathy sighs in no
time. Then she pulled back, decompressing them, before pushing back
forward a bit harder. Then again, and again. She squeezed them, pulled
at them, pushed into them, each movement bringing out more and more
pleasure deep within her.

Her ass wobbled around behind her, clapping together from her movements
as she went faster and faster, rubbing her tits down and moaning, eyes
closed tight and mouth agape until she finally came, nearly screaming
into her tits. A few seconds passed before she felt something.

"Oh no. I forgo-" Like airbags, her tits exploded out and up, bringing
her back slamming into her headboard. Almost instantly her tits had
doubled in size, and were quivering, waiting for the go ahead to grow
more. "Dumb curse\..." Yet another odd curse she had inherited within
the year. Every orgasm brought a certain\...risk, so to speak. Meaning,
each time she came, she had a chance of massively expanding. If she kept
getting carried away, well\...

She brought a hand to her newly expanded flesh. They took up the whole
king sized bed, leaving Sakura pinned to the headboard. The temptation
was there\...her quivering flesh begging her to push it further\...but
she feared that her butt may be tempted to join in. That was always the
risk, and what ultimately kept her from going any further\...however, it
WAS always temporary. The only other thing she worried about was getting
carried away and destroying her apartment.

"\...maybe someday, though\..." Sakura mused with a giggle.

The next day arrived and Sakura returned to the shop, body back to
normal. It felt different, however, as Tiffany wasn\'t by the counter
like she usually was. No, she was near the door, all dressed up and
seemingly ready to leave.

"You ready dear?" She asked, holding out her hand.

"Uh\...what for?" Sakura asked. Tiffany rolled her eyes.

"You just aren\'t one for surprises any more, are you?" She asked.

"I\'ve had enough surprises for one lifetime, Tiff."

"Oh nonsense, just take my hand." Tiffany persisted, shaking her hand a
bit to prove a point. Sakura did as she was told, and felt herself
abruptly whooshed away as they teleported to a vacant lot. It seemed
familiar somehow\...

"Tiff\...have we-"

"Been here before? Yes, dear, but there\'s a difference now\..." Tiffany
moved forward and opened the door. The doorknob seemed to spark at her
touch for a moment before turning and allowing them in. Inside was a
massive space, all empty. No shelves, no wallpaper, carpets. Nothing.
Wood paneling all around, that was all.

"So\...why are we in a big empty building, again?" Sakura asked,
half-joking.

"Well, dear\...this big empty space\...is yours." Tiffany said with a
sigh. Sakura\'s head sharply turned to look at her.

"Wh\...what do you mean?" Tiffany closed her eyes and started pacing the
room.

"You see dear\...I\'ve put a lot of thought into this. I\'ve\...loved
having you as an assistant. I\'ve never had one quite like you, you know
that? Someone\...curious. Strong. Smart. Can think on their feet. Its
characteristics I value quite a bit, dear. And its because of
that\...that I want you to start your own store, dear."

"So\...wait\...ME running a store? But\...but\..." Tiffany shook her
head and patted one of Sakura\'s shoulders.

"Dear, if you\'re worried you won\'t be able to do it: don\'t be.
You\'ve learned EVERYTHING you needed to know for me. You\'ve ran the
shop by yourself and crunched numbers while I was away. I think its time
you get your own space and tried it out, don\'t you?" Tiffany asked with
a smile.

Sakura didn\'t know what to say. It was all such a surprise, but\...made
sense somehow. All she could do was grab Tiffany in a big busted hug,
tears running down her cheeks.

"I\'ll do it!" It was so obvious to her. This is what she wanted to do!

"Perfect!" Tiffany replied with a clap, walking away towards the back of
the room. "I\'m getting so much overstock lately that I need a second
space to put it all, and you\'re just the girl I need to run it. Your
sales skills are one of a kind, dear. I expect great things!" She
hesitated as she got to the back wall.

"But first\..." She said, holding her hand out to the wall. In front of
where she put her hand, a door knob materialized, and then a door just
after that. "\...you need to pass a sort of\...initiation, dear."

"Initiation? You just said-"

"I unfortunately don\'t make these rules, dear. To run a magic shop of
any kind is\...well, its never been allowed to be run by any
non-Spellcrafter in the past. So this is a bit\...unprecedented. But
there\'s ways of proving yourself. A simple, easy way. That\'s right
through this door." Sakura liked the sound of this, but at the same
time, she couldn\'t help but worry. Tiffany did have a habit of holding
things back\...

They stepped through the doorway. The only thing on the other side was
yet another empty room, but the air felt\...different somehow. The door
shut behind them. It was eerily quite.

"Now then\...dear\...I am going to use a spell on you. And I need you to
make a choice on how you handle this spell. I can\'t say much more than
that, but it WILL decide your fate. Understood?"

It wasn\'t the first time Tiff had been cryptic with her. But all Sakura
could do was nod. Without further ado, Tiffany flicked her wrist. This
action alone made Sakura fall to her knees, a sudden strong sensation
sweeping through her.

"Oh God\...are you\...nnn\..." Sakura feared whatever it was Tiffany had
used. It felt\...good. Very good. And it kept feeling better. Sakura
pushed into her tits, like she had last night. No growth was happening,
though\...which led her to believe that\... "are you trying to make me
cum right now?" Sakura asked crudely. Tiffany didn\'t respond. She
merely watched.

The feeling got more and more intense. Sakura tried to hold back, but
she didn\'t know if that\'s what she SHOULD be doing right now.
Regardless, an orgasm ripped through her, causing to arch her back and
moan out. Her tits quivered.

"No, no\...there\'s no way, the odds are lower than this\..."

On cue, her tits vaulted outwards, doubling themselves instantaneously.
They dragged on the floor and pushed Sakura up into a standing position,
taking her breath away. The pleasure didn\'t stop, however. It merely
continued.

"Tiff\...Tiff! This is\...this is getting\..." The closed her eyes again
and screamed out as another orgasm hit. She kneaded her tits as she felt
them rumble outwards once again, dragging across the wood floor and
making her go cross-eyed with the pleasure. She collected herself,
focusing hard and trying her best to suppress the feelings as her tits
filled half of the small room.

The orgasm was creeping up on her. Getting closer and closer.

\'No\...\' Sakura thought to herself. \'I have control\...I can do
this\...\' She wanted to stop it. She couldn\'t grow anymore. No, this
was the test, right? Control? Or\...?

Sakura thought about it. She thought hard. These tits\...them getting
massive, in the past, had always scared her. But now, here she was,
filling a room and all that fear she would\'ve had all those years
ago\...was gone. She didn\'t need to hold back. Right now, her form of
control was\...letting go.

So she let go.

"nnnnnnNNNNNYAAAAAAHHHHHNNNNN" One of the loudest moans Sakura had every
muttered rushed out of her lips as her tits led a charge outwards. They
pumped, and pumped, and pumped, as it seemed Sakura now existed within
infinite climax. Her flesh covered the floor, pushing her to the wall.
Then the top of her tits hit the ceiling. Then they touched the walls.
They pressed and pressed, but the walls had no give. Was she going to
crush herself right now? The rational fear in her mind kicked in as she
opened her eyes.\
\
"NO!" And like that, she stopped growing. Room filling tits squishing
against her body. Where had Tiffany gone? It was pitch black as her tits
squeezed against her face. And then\...

She felt herself warped out, plopped back into the larger room with her
tits still engorged. She breathed heavily, gasping out for air as she
heard footsteps tapping by, approaching her head. She looked up and
over, her tits completely filling her view. It was Tiffany, a big smile
on her face.

"Control." She stated as she set a hand on one of Sakura\'s now room
filling-teats. "When to have it, and when to let go. An important thing
to know in growth magic, dear. I knew you\'d pass just fine." Sakura
chuckled, still getting her breath back.

"So\...let me guess\..." Sakura asked, patting her tits. "These are my
new sized tits, huh? I\'m bigger than Mano ever was!" Sakura pointed
out, her tits beating Mano\'s by a few feet.

"They can be\...if you so choose." Tiffany gave Sakura a side eye and
grinned. "But be honest with yourself, dear: do you really hate how big
your tits get these days?" Both of them laughed, knowing what the answer
was.

"So\...is the store mine then?" Sakura asked, getting to her feet. Her
tits lurched outwards in front of her. Even now, Sakura could still
move, a feat even Mano couldn\'t pull off. A mixture of magic and
attentive spirits made it all possible. Her spirits whirled around
inside her happily, grateful for the new space to live in.

"Oh yes, dear. You passed with flying colors." She waved her hands, the
store bursting to life with shelves and products on said shelves, all
positioned with enough space for Sakura to move around.

"I expect only greatness, dear. This is just a beginning, you know.
Sakura\'s Shop of Oddities has a pretty nice ring to it, doesn\'t it?"
Tiffany asked with a wink. Sakura looked back, thinking a moment.

"Sakura\'s Body Shop sounds pretty good to me too, honestly." Tiffany
laughed, but in an approving way.

"Well its all yours, dear. Do me a favor and make all of those flat
chested women out there as big as you can, ok?" She asked with a teasing
wink. Sakura nodded, navigating the shop with no issue. The spirits
turned her tits transparent for her own eyes. She could always see ahead
of her this way, which was an appreciated touch. She slid her hand down
them, still in awe of her new size. Tits that stood above her, twice her
height. Luckily she could change them at will if needed, for the most
part. She concentrated, feeling her tits draw back down.

But only until they were as tall as her. She couldn\'t seem to get them
any further than that. A twitch of worry went through her.

"Is this\...as small as I get?" Sakura asked, her voice quivering.

"Your body is still adjusting, dear. Give it some time. And remember to
embrace it. Work it. You were always good at that, you know." Tiffany
said with a wink. Sakura grinned and popped a hip out in a pose.
"That\'s the spirit, dear!"

Sakura smiled. While there was a worry in the back of her mind that this
would only cause her to grow bigger and bigger throughout her life,
another part of her simply\...didn\'t care. It was all too exciting! And
the more magic she learned, the more it all made sense.

Tiffany could see all this on Sakura\'s face. She smiled, and stepped
forward, giving her once busty assistant, now even bustier branch owner,
a squishy hug.

"I\'m proud of you dear." The words made Sakura choke up a bit.

With that, they parted. A new chapter had begun for Sakura.

And she couldn\'t wait to see where it went.

THE END
