<p>Wishes: Ad Infinitum  </p>
<p>Part Two </p>
<p>Inspired by a concept from Max Mammaries </p>
<p>ACT II – Jane’s Story </p>
<p>*Day 0  </p>
<p>Jane looked down on her best friend, feeling slightly bemused at 
the way the small girl was fizzing with energy. 
 Looked down not because she was snobbish, but her lanky 
frame meant even when sitting she had an inch and a half over 
her friends. 
 She wasn’t just long legs; her torso had once been described to 
her by a particularly unfortunate one-night stand like a ‘long stick 
with tits’. 
 That dickhead had just been unable to get over the fact that, 
even when standing, his eyes were only level with her shoulder 
blades. 
 The thing was, whilst most men liked the concept of a woman 
whose tits were up nearer their faces, the reality threw up too 
many challenges for them. The sensitive guys, the ones she 
thought might actually be able to cope, always seemed too 
intimidated to even approach her leaving her with the obnoxious 
twats who buggered off as soon as the novelty had warn off. 
 Jane had been around the houses several times; thought 
nothing could surprise her any more… 
 But in this instance she was a little taken aback. 
 Vickie was an addict. She always had been and always would 
be. She had one of those personalities that went ‘all in’ on 
anything she tried until she eventually burnt out. 
 She didn’t just have ‘hobbies’ – oh no, Vickie had life changing 
gear shifts that turned everything upside down. She’d moved 
from college club to club, pouring her heart and soul into each 
one before something else caught her fancy. </p>
<p>From sports team to dance club, she would have been a world 
class gymnast if her tits hadn’t come in with a vengeance – but 
on the other hand that could just be her body showing the same 
level of extreme commitment for being ‘all in’. 
 If it hadn’t been for Laura, whose body had adapted to one of the 
most extreme cases of macromastia, Vickie would have been 
one of the bustiest girls for miles. 
 Because unlike most of girls with big tits Vickie had barely an 
ounce of fat on her body that wasn’t hanging off her chest. If 
Jane was a ‘stick’ then what her dickhead date would have made 
of Vickie’s spindly torso mixed with filthy boobage she couldn’t 
imagine. 
 Skin, muscle, bone, tits and a smile that could light up a room, 
Vickie’s infectious personality had made them best friends for as 
long as Jane could remember. 
 That smooth muscle definition meant her boobs didn’t just plop 
into that F cup bra. No, they held themselves proud like some 
weirdly erotic ancient statue. 
 And when she got excited and hopped up and down on the spot 
like that they jiggled enticingly. Jane… Well, Jane had never 
been able ‘not’ to look down when the opportunity presented 
itself. 
 “It grants wishes,” Vickie explained, after a rambling dissertation 
on the current object of her affections. “And even if it’s not true I 
couldn’t let something like this pass me by, it’s got such a 
fascinating history.” 
 “Right,” Laura said sarcastically, idly rubbing the top of her 
boobs (the girl didn’t even realise she was doing it but from 
Jane’s elevated perspective that shit was obvious).<br />
 She couldn’t help herself but when your perspective was shifted 
upwards several feet your world had a lot of cleavage in it. 
 And when two of your best friends had to buy custom clothing to 
cope with their unique body shapes… 
 “And you want us to try it out with you?” </p>
<p>Three of them had gathered at Vickie’s house, all but one of 
Vickie’s quartet of close friends. 
 Their host had nearly cancelled when Penny had said she was 
working on her latest store opening (as if the girl needed even 
‘more’ money) but insisted it was important the two of them come 
as soon as possible. 
 “Take these pens and paper,” Vickie said with a smile, “Write 
down what it is you want, what you want most, and we can see if 
it works.” </p>
<p>*Day 10 </p>
<p>‘Men will not be intimidated by me’ 
‘Men will admire but also respect me and my wishes’ </p>
<p>Jane lay in bed reflecting on how much had changed in just under 
two weeks. 
 She had gone from a sceptic to a firm believer after a horrible 
ordeal with some of the most perverted, sick, sociopathic men 
imaginable. 
 Her original wish, that men would find her less intimidating, had 
repeated several times and eventually resulted in her becoming 
something less than human beneath the male gaze. 
 She hadn’t taken this seriously at all. 
 Vickie, who had slowly gone from almost stick thin (save for her 
impressive frontage) to a muscular behemoth had explained that 
each of their wishes were repeating each night, and would 
continue to do so as long as their written wish was left in the 
device’s top drawer. 
 Wishes Ad Infinitum… 
 So each successive day Vickie had continued to pack on more 
muscle, Laura’s general health had improved and slowly Jane’s 
reputational standing in the world had sunk ever lower. 
 All she’d wanted was for people to find her height less of a 
barrier. Well that body consciousness had really fucked her over 
now. 
 It seemed however that her replacement wish had undone that 
damage and then some. 
 And the proof, on her mobile phone, was there clear as day. 
 The pervert who had molested her at the end of the most 
atrocious date in history had sent her an apology of sorts. 
 Well, more than of sorts. </p>
<p>Don’t do that. </p>
<p>10:45 AM 
Fuck off and leave me alone. </p>
<p>8.11 AM 
I want to say how sorry I am! </p>
<p>8:45 AM 
Know you don’t want to hear anything from me! 
Letting you know I’ve checked into a clinic 
to try and resolve some psychological trauma. 
I don’t know what came over me. </p>
<p>9:12 AM 
 I know you are angry with me and I am sorry. </p>
<p>9:45 AM 
 I am angry with myself. I think I might 
kill myself for what I’ve done. </p>
<p>Okay, I won’t. </p>
<p>10: 15 
But I can’t live with how I hurt you. 
I haven’t been able to sleep since it happened. </p>
<p>10: 30 AM 
Sorry. </p>
<p>10: 45 AM 
What do you want me to do? </p>
<p>So, in a weirdly roundabout way, two wishes, both directed solely 
at Jane, had completely fucked this man’s life over. 
 He’d probably been a perfectly decent bloke before she’d done 
herself over with that stupid first wish and literally turned herself 
into a target. 
 Then in this new reality, where men had to respect her, reality 
had forced a deep psychological trauma onto him because that 
old chain of events just did not tally. 
 Despite everything she grinned at the message, enjoying the 
visible proof that everything was going to be just okay. She had 
the power now! 
 At work she was delighted at the way colleagues kept offering 
her coffee. The machine was just ten meters from her desk, but 
they all just seemed so keen to be useful! 
 At lunch time she stood in the cafeteria for the Wednesday lunch 
special feeling as though the world was at her feet. 
 “I’d like bolognaise,” she pointed at the chalk menu behind the 
counter. Proudly displayed at the top of the specials board, a little 
overpriced, but she felt like celebrating! 
 The waiter smiled and almost bowed as he noted her order 
down. 
 “An EXCELLENT choice ma’am,” he exclaimed, pointing at the 
card reader for her to pay. “I hope you enjoy it; it’s our chef’s 
speciality. He’s Italian you know, said the recipe was his 
grandmothers.” 
 “I’m sure I’ll enjoy it,” Jane smiled, walking away with a bottle of 
lemonade her receipt. 
 She crossed the room to join Vickie holding a table for them by 
the window. Their favourite spot. 
 Her friend was lounging in the big sofa chairs designed to dwarf 
their incumbent (Jane loved this café as these chairs almost 
made her feel ‘normal’ sized) and she looked absolutely radiant. </p>
<p>Had she been working out? She didn’t look sweaty but there was 
this sheen to her body that just made her look… Fuckable? 
 Why was every second thing about sex? 
 Jane’s wish should have been for a reduced (controllable, not 
reduced, the repeating wishes would have really screwed (or un-
screwed?) her over if she’d gone for that. 
 No, things had probably worked out for the best. 
 “So, what are you going to wish for next?” she asked, plonking 
her drink down beside her friend. “I mean, now we have proof it 
works you could ask for anything.” 
 “Oh, I’ve some ideas,” Vickie said with a mischievous smile. “But 
you showed me that we can’t rush this – what happened to you 
was horrible. We can’t let whatever we wish for backfire on us like 
that.” 
 “Well I think we’ve fixed it,” Jane said, “I haven’t had anyone 
creeping on me for the last few days. Quite the opposite 
actually…” 
 “But we haven’t actually tried to ‘undo’ the original wish – you 
asked for men not to be intimidated by you. They still aren’t – it’s 
just the by-product of that wish repeated several times was they 
viewed you as some sort of prey who needed hunting. The new 
wish means they respect you.” 
 “So they want to hunt me but they won’t do it without 
permission?” Jane summarised with a smug smile. Vickie nodded 
vigorously. “Well as a result I feel like royalty wherever I go!” 
 “Well I thought it’d be better to ask for something new that 
complemented the original wish without undoing it,” Vickie 
explained, twirling her hand in the air as she spoke. 
 The girl couldn’t sit still, she was always twitching or waving her 
hands in the air or pacing. 
 You’d think the hefty flesh filling her F cup bra would weigh a girl 
down but she barely seemed to notice them; despite how 
incongruous they looked on her bodybuilders frame. </p>
<p>Jane was sure she’d read that female bodybuilders had too much 
testosterone in their bodies. It was why they sometimes looked 
slightly masculine. Perhaps she was wrong but… 
 Nobody could ever accuse Vickie of being the slightest bit 
masculine! 
 “Well I’ll leave the new wish in until you tell me that your happy 
with it.” 
 “I’m more than happy for a few more days of this,” Jane grinned 
broadly. 
 She didn’t have any male friends really, no family she was close 
to, just men she had casually dated and then been hurt by at one 
point or another. 
 In her mind men were good for a fuck and that was about it. 
 Their food order arrived, the waiter told them how much he 
hoped she would enjoy the food, and then they both began to tuck 
in. 
 The bolognaise was good. Suspiciously excellent. 
 Jane was sure she’d eaten this special before and it hadn’t been 
half this tasty, and the portion size had been smaller. In fact, 
comparing her food to Vickie’s, it was clear a LOT more love and 
attention had gone into preparing her plate. 
 She hoped her friend hadn’t noticed. You could never tell with 
Vickie – she had a lot of blind spots where she almost seemed 
unaware of what was going on around her, but once in a blue 
moon she would come out with something incredibly insightful 
and profound and surprise them all. 
 “By the way,” Vickie said after sipping her tea, “There’s a pool 
party at Penny’s place on Friday, as soon as she gets back from 
Ibiza. Bring anyone you like…” 
 “But I haven’t got anyone,” Jane frowned. 
 Vickie just grinned at her. 
 “Well you have two days to find someone then!” </p>
<p>*Day 11 </p>
<p>Jane was flipping through old favourite photographs on her 
phone, something she thought might become a daily routine to 
check how reality had shifted, when a shadow appeared above 
her desk. 
 She panicked for a moment; she was supposed to be working not 
browsing social media. 
 Hurriedly she tried to look official, pretend she hadn’t been 
swiping through photographs of Laura and Vickie comparing 
absolutely titanic bikinis, and grinned up at Andrei. 
 “Hey,” she said as coolly as she could manage, grinning up at 
him from over her laptop. “Something up?” 
 “Just wondered if you wanted anything from the canteen,” he 
asked, gesturing with his thumb over his shoulder. He and a few 
guys were hovering by the lifts, three of them looking awkward 
whilst he had been sent to talk to her. 
 “You want me to come with you?” 
 “No,” he said, before shaking his head and correcting himself and 
adding; “Unless you want to. I just thought, since I know how busy 
you are, most days you never even leave your desk, I could get 
you something? You really came through for me with that report 
last week so I figured I owed you.” 
 “You really don’t owe me anything,” Jane said quickly, but then 
felt guilty when Andrei’s awkward smile crumpled; “But if your 
offering I’d love a chili beef burrito.” 
 “Chilli beef burrito,” he nodded, “And drink?” 
 “Coffee,” she grinned. 
 He gave her a mock salute and disappeared to join his friends. 
 Interesting, she thought, slyly picking back up her phone and 
grinning down at photos of Vickie’s F cup bikini which… She 
frowned, was really, really badly fitted. That girl was spilling out of 
the edges. </p>
<p>She must have been retaining water that week but Jane couldn’t 
remember that happening. Weird. 
 Still, the girls bulging muscles were still her most prominent 
feature! Laura was all tits but Vickie offered the most complete 
package of extreme body shapes; massive tits, toned thighs and 
spectacular abs. 
 No wonder their little quartet were best friends; although all 
Penny and Jane brought to their table was their polar opposite 
heights. 
 Thinking of Penny she still needed to find a date for tomorrow 
and if Andrei was trying to get into her good books. 
 She’d certainly had worse ideas and time was running out… </p>
<p>*Day 12 </p>
<p>Standing upright in the shallow end of her personal Olympic size 
swimming pool the undersides of Penny’s tits brushed the surface 
of the water. 
 Standing right beside her Jane’s belly button wasn’t even wet. 
 But both looked stunning in the most fashionable bikinis that 
money could afford. 
 The costumes were Penny’s treat (her friends had to be the best 
dressed after all) and both were the centre of attention from the 
swarm of men who kept offering each of them drinks. 
 Jane’s glass was never empty, so much so she had to 
consciously stop herself several times or things would get out of 
control far too quickly. 
 “Is Vickie here?” she asked, looking around the crowded pool, 
looking for her friend. “I can’t see…” 
 “She said she’d be late,” Penny sighed, swishing her arms 
through the water to make waves. Her friend was extra tanned 
since her trip to Ibiza. “She was still at work when I phoned her at 
half six, said she was looking into the Dream Chests history to 
better understand how it works.” 
 “I can’t believe all this comes from that,” Jane marvelled, looking 
around the mansion complex Vickie has bought. 
 Jane remembered coming to this house, remembered partying in 
this very pool before. 
 But apparently her friend had only owned it a week! 
 In her own memories Penny had inherited it over a decade ago. It 
was weird to think that the world, and with it her own personal 
history, had changed without anyone noticing. 
 Penny had wished for money, wished a few days after Vickie, 
Jane and Laura had been introduced to the Dream Chest, and 
only her and Vickie were aware of the changes. </p>
<p>Just as Penny had no memories of men ever being intimidated 
by Jane’s height. According to Penny Jane had apparently always 
had a commanding presence to match her height, and an air of 
authority that made people respond in kind.<br />
 They had spent half an hour drinking gin and comparing notes on 
what each could remember about the other. It was a weird thing 
for two women, who were supposed to be best friends, to do but 
apparently necessary. 
 They were clearly compatible people – they had been friends in 
both the old reality and the new one – but it was like discovering a 
secret side to a person you thought you had known your whole 
life. 
 Weird and just a little bit violating. 
 “Well Laura is going to get hammered,” Jane said with a frown as 
their other friend cannonballed into the deep end of the pool from 
the diving board. 
 Whilst the two of them had been careful up to now with their 
drinks, insisting that there were generous measures of mixer with 
the gin, Laura had shown no such inhibitions. 
 The self-proclaimed ‘Tit’ania was quite clearly buzzing with 
alcohol, had last been seen doing shots with three men, before 
darting across the complex and leaping from the diving board. 
 Seeing tits larger than most people’s head bouncing into the pool 
from on high was a sight most thought they would never see but 
the image was now burned into Jane’s eyes. 
 And the splash was immense. 
 “If she doesn’t stop that’s going to leave her one hell of a 
hangover in the morning. Should we go and stop…” 
 “But Laura doesn’t get hangovers,” Penny said with a frown, arm 
holding her back from stepping forwards. “She’s never had a 
hangover – the alcohol just passes straight through her.” 
 “What?” Jane paused, remembering her friends wish. “Oh, yes, I 
remember. She wished for good health. Fuck, have things really </p>
<p>changed that much? Now she can drink like a fish and not suffer 
consequence! Why didn’t I think of that?” 
 “See, when you say it aloud it makes sense that it’s a wish, but to 
me Laura has just… always been like that,” Penny said looking 
slightly perturbed.<br />
 Together they watched Laura emerge from the deep end of the 
pool. Dark hair burst up first, followed by her head, shoulders and 
then naked breasts. Two pink orbs, each larger than her head, 
that thrust up towards her head before bobbing back down to 
settle low on her chest. 
 Her dark nipples settled just under the water line but their 
prominent shadows lurked under the water. The glimpse they had 
all seen indicates each was massive; even compared to the rest 
of her hefty assets. 
 Everyone in the pool went silent. 
 The crowds unified attention turned to Laura’s naked tits, so large 
and buoyant that they floated before her like two small beachballs 
glued to her chest.<br />
 Her swimsuit, come loose in the commotion, surfaced to float 
next to her like an enormous orange dinghy. It was freakishly 
enormous but it had to be to contain her twin dirigibles. 
 Laura giggled, gave her friends a peace sign, and then began to 
swim towards them (and away from her abandoned swimsuit). 
Her frontage wobbled beneath her, rising and falling hypnotically 
with each stroke. 
 “Did she also wish for those breasts?” Jane asked quietly as 
‘tit’ania approached them. 
 “I don’t think so,” Penny replied sombrely, “But then how would 
we know? Vickie said that apart from you we’d each had one wish 
each.” 
 They both stared as Laura swam nearer, two large, pale, fleshy 
orbs twinkling beneath the surface. They waited until she was 
within earshot. </p>
<p>“You’ve lost something,” Penny said at last, “Although I think 
those guys are going to fish it out for you.” 
 “They’ll probably want to keep it as a trophy,” Laura giggled, her 
eyes wild with alcoholic delight. She was slurring slightly but not 
too much… “This is more comfortable – I float naturally so that 
thing was just weighing me down.” 
 “Your nipples are showing,” June pointed out. 
 Now she was standing in the shallows her boobs were (mostly) 
clear of the water and everyone had a direct, uninterrupted view 
of her chest. 
 Her breasts were incredible; jutting proudly forwards and 
sideways from her torso. Long, graceful curves that hung deep on 
her chest, sagging slightly under their own immense weight. 
Nipples larger than thumbs stood proud at her extremity, angled 
slightly downwards as gravity inexorably pulled her down. 
 Laura was a work of nature. The few, minor stretch marks that 
dotted the edges of her tits only accentuated their impressive 
bulk. 
 “Don’t be a prude,” Laura laughed, before prodding her friend 
and giggling (which set her whole upper body shaking in turn). 
“You’ve seen me naked before in the changing room.” 
 “These people haven’t,” Jane waved her hand around the 
crowded party “Are you trying to start an orgy?” 
 “Oooh,” Laura smiled, her face going momentarily vacant. “If 
enough of them have just a ‘little’ bit more they might be up for 
that. I need some more vodka… Do you two want anything as 
well?” 
 “I’m good,” Penny grinned. 
 And as Laura splashed (and bobbed) her way to the edge of the 
pool the two of them noticed Vickie appearing at the edge of the 
pool.<br />
 Her G cup bikini, also a special present from Penny, was a sight 
to behold. And whilst Laura’s swimsuit had to look like a tent out </p>
<p>of necessity to contain her behemoths Vickie’s was just a thin 
strip of fabric designed to conceal her nipples. 
 Jane noted that the slightest tug and their second most endowed 
friends’ tits would spill free in an avalanche of enclosed flesh. 
 Penny slapped her friend to stop her starring. 
 “What’s wrong Jane? You’re such a prude.” 
 “It’s just Laura IS topless, and Vickie might as well be,” Jane 
replied, shuddering slightly. “I don’t think I’m drunk enough for 
this.” 
 “Then go get some more gin then you prude,” Penny laughed. 
Jane sighed and began to wade to the side of the pool, adjusting 
her top as she went. 
 Some guys hovering by the pool entrance saw her approaching 
and moved aside to let her through. Their eyes were glued to her 
as she passed, and she noticed a few marvelling at her sculpted 
bikini, but none said anything. 
 Vickie raced to meet her at the pool edge, the smaller bombshell 
bouncing up and down with excitement in the most indecent 
manner. 
 “Can you believe it Jane! It’s marvellous; everything has 
changed so much!” 
 “It doesn’t feel like it,” Jane said with a sigh, “I can’t remember 
the old Penny. In my memories we’ve always partied at her 
house. We were in this pool sunbathing just last month!” 
 For just a moment Vickie looked a little taken aback but 
eventually she just shrugged and grinned. 
 Then she raised up and flexed her arm, showing off the way her 
toned muscles glistened in the light. 
 “I guess we need to be careful what we wish for. No more ‘on 
the spot’ wishes – we all do them together or we don’t do them at 
all. I’m not going to risk my best friends falling out over this.” 
 Yeah, Jane thought as they weaved their way through the crowd 
towards the stocked bar. </p>
<p>Vickie’s wish had turned her into an Olympic level athlete. Had 
that always been her plan or had she just wanted extra help 
lifting those fucking huge tits? 
 Laura was famously slovenly but then she had the excuse that 
running wasn’t just difficult but bloody impossible when hulking 
around two boulders several times the size of her head. 
 Vickie’s boobs on the other hand had taken to her new hyper-
athlete form with aplomb. 
 Jealousy was a terrible thing but Jane couldn’t help but focus on 
her friends bodies. She’d always, always been body conscious; 
you couldn’t not be when your height instantly drew anyone’s 
eyes from across the room. 
 Had she subconsciously been attracted to girls with massive tits 
because they offered the best chance of distracting attention 
from her height? 
 Why were none of her friends flat chested? 
 As if to prove a point they found Laura, sat upright in the next 
room, boobs resting on the table before her. She seemed to be 
challenging a group of men to line up and take shots from out of 
her cleavage. 
 “Tequila!” the group cried out as the last of the men dived his 
head into her bosom. The drunken girl reached out, wrapped her 
hand around his head and shoved him in deeper. 
 Vickie paused to stare at their friend, a mixture of lust and 
excitement in her eyes. 
 ‘So… this is ‘that’ sort of party is it?” 
 “Just like every party,” Jane replied with a shrug. “Penny’s money 
attracts a wild bunch. It’s a good job she has in house security in 
case anything happens.” 
 “No,” Vickie wagged her finger at her friend; “This is the first time 
we’ve done anything like this. This is the first party about the rest 
of our lives!” </p>
<p>----- </p>
<p>The evening drew late and, as it got colder, the party began to 
move inside. 
 Vickie, Penny and Jane were part of a small crowd that had 
gathered in the basement, all gathered around an enormous table 
adorned with playing cards and a large bowl with a suspiciously 
fluorescent orange liquid… 
 About two thirds of the people Jane recognised although she 
could barely name any of them besides her two closest. She was 
wondering what interactions this new her had with any of them, 
wondered if any of them thought they had a personal history with 
her she was unaware of. 
 The Dream Chest was a scary thing if you spent too long thinking 
about it. As Penny showed the entire world, her entire history, had 
changed without her realising it. 
 Perhaps she should just stop worrying about it and enjoy the 
benefits Vickie’s new toy had brought them. 
 But Jane was a worrier at heart. She had never been very good 
at letting things go and just relaxing. 
 “Pick a card,” Vickie said, patting her friends arm to try and 
encourage her back into the room. Jane jumped forwards, 
snatching the nearest playing card, and turned it over to reveal 
the jack of clubs. 
 “Dare!” her friend hooted with glee, turning to look around the 
room. “Who has the task master card?” 
 “I do,” said Andrei, her nominal date for the evening, said holding 
up the ace of clubs. It must be the drink talking but Jane had 
never appreciated how good looking he was! 
 He was tall, slim, very smart but not at all straight laced or boring. 
He just had this easy-going charm to him that never came across 
well in the office but here, with a drink in his hand, was more than 
endearing. </p>
<p>He smiled sheepishly at Jane, an apologetic look in his eyes as 
he reached towards the cocktail bowl in the centre of the room to 
refill his glass. 
 Liquid courage she realised. He was feeling guilty about what he 
was about to do. 
 People in the room were hooting as Andrei bit his lip and then 
with a spark of inspiration let out a massive Cheshire cat grin. 
 “Jane, I dare you to go upstairs, find Laura, and take a selfie 
sucking on one of her nipples!” 
 “Fucking yes,” Penny cheered, spilling her own cocktail drink as 
she toasted Andrei. “I’ve been pissed off all night that she’s better 
things to do than join this game.” 
 “Her better thing to do is a marketing executive,” Jane replied 
with a frown. “God knows what their up to right now.” 
 “Nathaniel won’t mind the interruption, he’d probably enjoy the 
extra attention,” Penny said with a wink. “You’ve got to do what 
the Task Master says, it’s the rules.” 
 Andrei looked sheepish but when she nodded her head in 
acceptance an enormous grin spread over his face. 
 Jane put down her drink, wondering if she was really drunk 
enough to do this, and glanced longingly at the clock wondering if 
she should go to bed early or just play along. 
 It was nearly midnight! She’d been drinking non stop for over six 
hours so this would not end well. 
 Vickie was looking bemused. 
 Penny was hooting and waiving her arm, pumping up the 
excitement in the room. The crowd was unanimous, they all 
wanted Laura and her tits to get involved in the game, they were 
all irritated that she had flaked out early with her chosen conquest 
for the evening. 
 The clock struck the hour. 
 Jane’s eyes met Vickie’s. 
 For just a moment the flesh beneath Vickie’s scandalously 
revealing bikini twitched… </p>
<p>*Day 13 </p>
<p>Vickie was glancing down at her own boobs, a massive grin 
spread across her chest. 
 She was the only one not looking at Jane, the only one not 
cheering her on. 
 Nobody noticed, nobody was paying attention to the second 
bustiest girl in the building because they were enamoured with the 
prospect of Jane sucking down the nipple of her one true 
competitor. 
 But Vickie, and on a subconscious level perhaps Jane, had 
noticed her new designer H cup bikini top form itself around her 
swollen bosom.<br />
 The straps were wider than the one she had been wearing 
before, a little broader to spread the weight of their precious cargo 
across her shoulders. 
 She had more flesh on display than ever before if that was 
possible and the girl was loving it. 
 But the room had not noticed. The room was too focused on 
Jane’s quest for Laura’s nipple. 
 Although Andrei, who had been grinning like a lunatic a second 
before, was now looking awkward. He shrugged his shoulders 
and grinned apologetically at Jane. 
 “If you want to do it?” he said, turning the ace of clubs over in his 
hand. He dropped the playing card to the floor, took another sip of 
his drink and offered “I can think of something else?” 
 The cheering had quietened a little. Jane could tell. Everyone 
was still eager, they ‘wanted’ her to do this, but the incessant 
demand had faded. 
 The pressure, the crowd mentality that had overwhelmed the 
room just before midnight, had completely dissipated. 
 She could do what she wanted. </p>
<p>“No, it’s fine!” Jane replied with a grin. She had the advantage 
now and she was going to use it. With that horrible push gone she 
was happier to go ahead, but not on their terms, on hers. “I’ll suck 
on Laura’s nipple if you fetch her Andrei. I’m not getting between 
her and her cock, but if you bring her down here, lay her flat on 
that table and present her to me I’ll suck her rock-hard nipple off 
as though I was giving the best blowjob in history.” 
 Andrei visibly gulped. 
 A very dejected man left the room a few moments later to a 
hollering encouragement from his friends. Whether he would 
return with, or without, Titania however was doubtful. 
 “If I’m doing this then I want your phones,” Jane declared to the 
room, leaping to her feet and grabbing one of the empty chip 
bowls from the corner. She held it up for all the people in the room 
to see. “No cameras, put your phones in the bowl or you’ll get 
nothing from me tonight.” 
 And to her surprise and delight not a single one objected. She 
was left with a bowl full of mobile phones, an enraptured 
audience, and a pause whilst she awaited to see whether Andrei 
would return alone or with a friend for her to pleasure. 
 She took one last long swig of liquid courage and grinned with 
realisation about the way she could control the room. 
 Fucking hell yeah! </p>
<hr />
<p>Vickie watched Jane with suspicion. 
 That girl knew! It might be subconscious; she might not be aware 
of it but Jane had watched her fleshy orbs bubble up a size bigger 
as the clock struck midnight. </p>
<p>It was the first night Vickie had been awake through the 
transformation and it has been awesome. The moment she’d felt 
a glowing warmth in her chest she’d nearly orgasmed there on the 
spot! 
 Hopefully Jane would be too drunk to remember. None of the 
other girls knew she had wished for bigger tits. None of the other 
girls knew she secretly planned to out-pace Laura for the titty 
crown. 
 They all thought muscles were here one and only thing. 
 Well she would have both and none of them would be any the 
wiser. Soon, about a week and a half away, she would reach that 
goal. 
 Buzzing with excitement she grabbed her date and retreated 
upstairs to better explore her new body.  </p>
<hr />
<p>That Jane had a hangover was predictable. 
 That she awoke with a man in the bed besides her was not as 
guaranteed but definitely a pleasant surprise. She turned over a 
few times before realising it was Andrei, her task master, the man 
she had effectively cucked last night. 
 Definitely a one night stand she thought. It might have been a 
pity shag but her memories after midnight were quite hazy. 
 That he offered to cook breakfast was a nice bonus. 
 Whilst he cooked Jane padded her way around Penny’s mansion 
looking to see if any of her friends were up. 
 Surprisingly Laura was waiting in the lounge, dressed only in a 
bathrobe, watching television whilst playing puzzle games on her 
mobile. </p>
<p>“You don’t even look tired,” Jane remarked as she slotted in 
besides her. Laura offered a toothy grin in response. “Is this as 
weird for you as it is me? It’s like Penny is a completely different 
person; but from her perspective she’s known us her whole life.” 
 “Just roll with it,” Laura shrugged, twisting her neck and cricking 
her shoulders. Her boobs surged forwards with the upper body 
movement, threatening to pop out from beneath her robe. “I have 
never felt better than I do now…” 
 “Can you even get hurt?” Jane asked, surprised. 
 Laura nodded quickly 
 “I stubbed my toe pretty hard the other day and it was horrible 
until the bleeding stopped… But I think it healed quicker than it 
would have normally. I’m not super-human, just healthier and 
more resilient than the average woman.” 
 “And I seem to be getting my way a lot more than normal,” Jane 
nodded with a sigh, “It seems like a wasted wish. Penny’s life has 
completely transformed, and our ex-little Vickie has turned into 
some kind of Olympian. Who knew she had that specific desire in 
her?” 
 “Well I saw her lifting weights the other day,” Laura said with a sly 
grin; “The girl is stacked in ALL the right ways.” 
 They gossiped about their experience from last night, about the 
crazy ways the world had changed, how this never could have 
possibly happened in their old lives. 
 Although half way through Jane realised something was off. 
 Some things Laura remembered perfectly but others were just 
not right. Like the time they had both been arrested for drunken 
behaviour on Vickie’s twenty first birthday. 
 It had been a great learning experience – the two of them 
dragged out of the club and deposited in the back of a police car. 
One night in the cells to cool down, a small fine to pay for wasting 
police time, then home with no more said or done about the 
incident. </p>
<p>Only the way Laura told it Laura had been arrested and Jane had 
picked her up from the clink the following morning. 
 It was such a small detail but she didn’t dare correct her friend. It 
was just another way the world really was still changing. 
 Andrei bought them both food, apologised sheepishly for his 
behaviour last night, and then quietly left to let them enjoy their 
breakfast in peace. 
 The two friends grinned at each other at the quiet way they had 
shamed him without saying a word. 
 Several of the other guests who had stayed over departed, 
stopping in to say goodbye to the two girls and briefly enquire if 
Penny was up. Midday came and neither their host or Vickie 
seemed to show any sign of coming down to join them. 
 Eventually Laura glanced over Jane’s shoulder and said; “Your 
ride is here.” 
 “Ride?” Jane replied, glancing over her shoulder at a suited 
gentleman who had just entered the room. He was holding a 
suitcase and a coat out ready for her. 
 “For the ad campaign,” Laura grinned. “ 
 He waited by the door, a suitably respectful distance, although it 
was clear he was waiting for her. 
 Well this was unexpected. </p>
<p>*Day 14 </p>
<p>Jane watched the footage back on her phone, impressed at how 
quickly the ad team had been able to slice together a first draft 
within twenty-four hours over a Saturday night! 
 Someone had slaved away on this through the weekend. 
 She had spent the car journey reading through her emails on her 
phone to try and figure out what was going on. The answer had 
been quite simple. 
 Business was booming. It was booming so well that she had 
been asked two years ago, and apparently agreed, to become the 
public face of the company. 
 So now, as well as sit in an office and make spreadsheets, she 
got to wear designer clothing, have professional makeup applied 
and make speeches to visiting business delegates at high level 
meetings. 
 And sometimes they filmed her speeches to use as promotional 
adverts. 
 And sometimes they paid her fucking millions for the exclusive 
rights to her work. She discovered she was under a exclusivity 
deal worth more per year than her house was worth. 
 “Buy our products,” she would conclude with when addressing a 
room full of corporate shills. There were a few high-powered 
women around her but it was mostly men. 
 And every single man in the room would listen, respectfully 
acknowledge her wish, and do just fucking that! 
 ‘I don’t like the way my hair looks from that camera angle,’ she 
thought self-critically, grimacing slightly at the footage. She 
emailed the editor a quick note; </p>
<p>came the quick reply, </p>
<p>“Can you not use that one and just </p>
<p>use the other shots? Otherwise looks fab.”
 “Of course,”</p>
<p>“Not a problem.”</p>
<p>Jane sighed, deciding that she needed lunch. The sun was 
nearly setting, and she hadn’t decided what to have for dinner yet. 
Perhaps steak to celebrate? 
 “Andrei?” she called, wondering downstairs to find her new 
admirer. He had come to apologise that morning, offered to cook 
her lunch and accidentally revealed he was a celebrated chef 
amongst his friends. 
 Jane liked good quality food so she decided to keep him. </p>
<p>*Day 25 </p>
<p>Vickie watched the morning news briefing with a frown. 
 After an hour pleasuring herself in bed, enjoying the sensitive 
joys her new frontage had brought whilst distracting herself from 
the horrors of the day, she realised it was time to get to work. 
 But she was just sooooo big now! Each tit just filled her chest, 
they had finally succumbed to gravity so they hung low to her 
naval despite how far they projected forwards. 
 And they were just so sensitive – every time she shifted and felt 
them move it made her feel moist. 
 But despite how good she felt she’d been watching the news, 
worrying about what was going on in the world for some time now. 
 Since the weekend party at Pennys, such a hedonistic let down 
of all her inhibitions, the reality of modern life had hit them like a 
stone. 
 At first she’d started masturbating just to try to forget about what 
was going on but now it had just become a habit. She had to 
physically force herself NOT to begin rubbing down there, or 
squeezing a nipple and groping herself silly. 
 She had to get out of bed but that would mean lifting these 
immense weights. Much easier just to lie back and carry on self-
administering pleasure… 
 She’d been tempted to use the Dream Chest to try and make the 
world a better place but the consequences of large-scale changes 
seemed too unpredictable. 
 Particularly after how she’d already massively screwed with all of 
her friends lives already. 
 She’d promised to stop, not to touch the Dream Chest without 
them present and she meant to stick to that promise. 
 That she’d left two repeating wishes, one for herself and one for 
Jane in there whilst she waited for the chance to get them all 
together again, was hers (and partially Jane’s) secret. </p>
<p>Only… it wasn’t any more. 
 She’d turned on the morning news to find out what was going on 
in the world, what was going to happen to her job, when she’d 
seen a familiar face grinning at her from across the media pulpit. </p>
<p>head better into shot. 
“As mayor of this city,”
 The stand, that usually covered most politicians to mid chest, 
only barely covered the gangly woman’s hips. The cameras 
seemed to lap her up however, her curves accentuated in a 
tasteful way by her business suit that covered everything but 
hinted at the woman beneath. </p>
<p>Jane said, leaning forwards to bring her </p>
<p>“I am sorry to announce that further measures have to be 
temporarily adopted. I am going to impose several, temporary, 
public emergency instructions to ensure that our city is not further 
 The small media circus was listening with rapt attention. The men 
affected by this turmoil.” 
more than the women Vickie had to say but when the mood was 
one of calm respect and acceptance it seemed almost everyone 
was fully bought into the Jane brand. </p>
<p>“City funds have been released to deal with this crisis and I have the 
authority to announce investments in infrastructure and public 
health. Though this is a difficult day we will get through this, I wish 
to take you all on this journey wish me and soon, if not tomorrow 
 Fucking hell. 
then soon, we can put this dark day behind us…” 
 Too much had changed, Vickie realised. 
 She’d accidentally created a billionaire delinquent, installed a 
new city mayor and ruined one of her best friendships in the 
process. 
 Squeezing her titanic breasts close to her chest she realised that 
she had to stop this now before the changes went any further. </p>
<p>The Dream Chest was hidden in the cupboard beneath her 
television, just where she had left it since Jane’s visit to her house 
a fortnight earlier. 
 The night where she had secretly, without telling anyone, sent 
her down this path to becoming the bustiest woman on the planet. 
 To get to it she would have to crouch down, but she couldn’t just 
lean forwards – no matter how strong her muscles had become 
her back could not take that weight. 
 Her days of acrobatics, fun as they may have been, were now 
long behind her, and all the material evidence she had that they 
had ever existed had gone; replaced by photos of… these 
beautiful monsters! 
 And she couldn’t kneel – her tits now overfilled her lap. There 
was just too much flesh between her torso and her legs for her to 
get low enough to reach into the cupboard comfortably. 
 And she wasn’t going to lie on her front because that would just 
be too painful. 
 She managed to cramp herself down low enough to reach her 
arm in and reach out for the Dream Chest. Her hand reached into 
the cupboard and waived through empty space. 
 Disbelieving she reached out again, further back, and her fingers 
touched the dry wood of the back of the cupboard. 
 It was empty. 
 The Dream Chest was gone. 
 And her own chest was still fucking growing! </p>

<p>ACT I – Vickie’s Story </p>
<p>*Day 0  </p>
<p>Vickie stared at her reflection in the mirror. 
 Her critical eyes focusing in on each of her perceived faults, 
expanding them until they were all she could see. A mental 
checklist that grew in length and gained flashing exclamation 
marks with every passing second.<br />
 Too many freckles!<br />
 Eyes too close together!<br />
 Flat chest!<br />
 Podgy Belly!<br />
 Nondescript ass!<br />
 Her face was too square!<br />
 Scrawny, weak arms and legs!<br />
 No one could quite tell if her hair was red or brown, it was 
something muddy in between.<br />
 In conclusion a plain, average looking woman that was ‘okay’ but 
would never turn heads in a crowd.<br />
 The problem was she was too thin. Her arms, legs and torso had 
no meat to them at all. She was skin and bone, a walking 
skeleton in need of more than just one big meal. But whenever 
she did eat the fat went straight to her stomach and nobody 
thought a pot-bellied woman was sexy so she stayed thin and 
emaciated. 
 Everyone said ‘lean’ was beautiful – just look at the models 
starving themselves to fit into size zero dresses – but they were<br />
thin ‘with’ curves and perfect skin. She was just… 
 Well, she was just small.<br />
 It wasn’t feminine. It wasn’t sexy.  </p>
<p>She didn’t hate her body, but neither was she particularly 
attached to the damn thing. She had turned out… fair? Average?<br />
Normal? Not pretty, but not ugly either, just an ordinary girl.<br />
Someone that nobody would pick out of a crowd.<br />
 She was fed up of being ordinary. Fed up of being weak.  </p>
<p>Whenever she was out with her friend’s men ignored her.<br />
 Each and every one inevitably dove towards Jane, Penny or 
Laura…<br />
Tall, short or busty, her best friends and ex-classmates had all 
the female attributes between them to appeal to any man. All of 
them were beautiful but distinct.<br />
 If it weren’t for her fantastic tits Jane could have been described 
as a beanpole! She was almost as thin as Vickie but she had 
some muscle and the curves were there where it counted. Over 
six and a half feet tall with beautiful radiant blonde hair she stood 
out in any crowd. She was so elegant, so authoritative.<br />
 When Jane entered a room the world saluted.<br />
 Conversely Penny was just a few inches bigger than any legal 
definition of being medically short, and her lack of height meant 
the plentiful curves she had stood out on her petite frame double.<br />
She was sensual and voluptuous, short but stacked, her body 
incapable of adopting any pose that failed to radiate her beauty.<br />
 Then there was the self-declared ‘tit’-ania herself.<br />
 Sexy, ultra-top-heavy Laura; who has been a DD-cup at 14 and 
not stopped piling on extra boobage until she was past 21. She 
was gorgeous, with radiant red hair and a perfectly lightly 
freckled face that looked stunning from any angle as long as you 
could tear your eyes upwards! <br />
 Her eyes were deep blue, stunningly captivating, and they had to 
be to stop your gaze falling downwards into the cleavage below. 
Cleavage that went on for miles, that bounced and swayed and 
entranced everyone who saw it.  </p>
<p>It felt as though Laura’s curves entered a room several minutes 
before the rest of her, like the prow of a great ship clearing the 
way. <br />
 All three had qualities that made them special!<br />
 None of the three could be remotely called ordinary, and all three 
had curves that had men fawning over themselves to get at. They 
were almost too successful in love – they had no problem 
attracting men, but long-term relationships were… 
 Difficult.<br />
 Unlike Vickie who had spent several years working very hard at 
not being jealous. After all it wasn’t their fault her friends had 
been born genetically blessed.<br />
They were great girls to hang out with; fun, exciting, friendly. The 
group had such a great dynamic and though all three of them 
were different they made Vickie feel stronger by being amongst 
them.<br />
 Alone she felt week, but they held her up; treated her as 
someone special even though she really didn’t think she was.<br />
When she was alone Vickie hated herself for being weak and 
pathetic, but they never treated her like that, and she loved each 
and every one of them for it.<br />
 In the absence of a love life of any sort Vickie tended to keep her 
head down and study. She partied – she partied hard when the 
occasion came, but she slept alone and found other things to 
occupy her time besides men.<br />
 Almost all of her energy went towards her research.  A PhD in 
archaeology had sounded exciting at the start but without her 
three best classmates, who had all graduated and got high 
powered jobs after University, she’d found a career in academia 
a lot less fun than expected.<br />
 At least until she had discovered the Dream Chest.<br />
 It was a simple relic, not an ancient treasure but a hundred-year-
old antique that could only be traced back to the early days of the 
British Empire. It had been pilfered from some ancient part of the </p>
<p>world long forgotten – the thieves had returned it to the empire 
without bothering to inform their lords and masters which ancient 
culture they had looted it from. There were a lot of items that fit 
this description, but the Dream Chest was special.<br />
 She had been helping catalogue a museum foreclosure to sell 
on the assets when she’d discovered the box. It had belonged to 
a Victorian Heiress, one who had passed through the British 
Colonies before settling in America.<br />
 Legend said she had written her heart’s desire in the dream 
chest and it had come true, she’d married an American lawyer 
and lived happily ever after, spawning six children and a dynasty 
that had flourished for the next fifty years.<br />
 Eventually it had gone to the museum and been catalogued 
away with all the other nondescript oddities.<br />
Something about the box had tickled Vickie so rather than price it 
up for resale she’d bought it herself. It had taken a month to get 
internal approval but to anyone not familiar with the box’s 
intimate history it was just a small oddity of no real worth.<br />
 Well, they would test that theory tonight.<br />
 So, she had immediately invited round Jane and Laura (Penny 
was on duty at the record store prepping for the week ahead) and 
showed them her new prize. Sunday night be dammed!<br />
 Enjoying their bemused expressions, she explained the history 
of her new acquisition with pride, then stood back so the two 
women could have a closer look at it.<br />
 Once she had explained how the box was supposed to work she 
nipped out to the toilet so they could consider their dreams. She 
had been thinking about hers for a while now but she wanted to 
give them time to consider.<br />
 It was just a bit of harmless fun but imagine if it really did work?<br />
She gazed into her reflection in the mirror, taking a mental note 
of her small, weak body. If her suspicions about the box were 
right…  </p>
<p>So, clutching a piece of paper in her hand, she turned from the 
full-length mirror in her bathroom and re-joined them in the 
lounge.<br />
 To her disappointment both sat on her sofa at the fat end of the 
room looking at each other doubtfully, pens still idle and not a 
single thought jotted down.<br />
 “You just write your dream on a scrap of paper and leave in the 
top drawer,” she said, wiping clean a line of dust along the back 
wooden edge with her finger. “It is supposed to bring you luck.”<br />
“Is this actual witch magic?” Laura asked suspiciously, “Or have 
you lost your head girl?”<br />
 “I thought it would be fun,” Vickie replied, which got Laura 
nodding at least. “You don’t have to do it if you don’t want to.”<br />
“I’m game for anything,” Jane laughed, “But when you said you 
had something amazing to show us, that it couldn’t wait, I didn’t 
expect it to be this. I thought you might have been holding out on 
us and…”<br />
 “She’s too wrapped up in her work,” said Laura, who was 
scribbling, then crossing out and tossing away, then re-scribbling 
notes. A pile of scrap paper was forming by her feet, and her 
eyes were glinting with mischief. “I can’t work out which wish 
would be most fun. I’m just going to wish for good health. It’s all I 
really want.”<br />
 “Sensible,” Jane nodded sympathetically.<br />
 Laura worked as a senior nurse, the most popular nurse by 
some margin, at the local maternity ward. She said it was perfect 
besides two things; because of her bust everyone assumed she 
was a wet nurse, and secondly she picked up every infection 
going around off the patients.<br />
 Satisfied she leant forwards over the small box with her 
completed wish and frowned down at it suspiciously. Her 
pendulous boobs dwarfed the small antique and for a second 
Vickie was terrified her friend would take the opportunity to crush 
it.  </p>
<p>She’d dropped her assets on more sturdy things before and 
come out the victor! 
 “You just slot it in there?”<br />
 “Top drawer,” Vickie nodded, tapping the drawer that opened 
and closed. Below it was a slot into the lower compartment which 
despite trying to pry open was sealed firmly shut. “If it comes true 
you’re meant to place in the bottom one. Then when the chest is 
full it means all your dreams have come true.”<br />
 “Crazy,” shrugged Jane, climbing to her feet to join her friend. 
Together they slotted two post-it notes into the top drawer. “I just 
want to meet a few men less intimidated by my size. I’m fed up of 
first dates who think I’ll be exciting but who just can’t handle a 
full-size package.”<br />
 Jane’s longest relationship ever was four months.<br />
 That was three and a quarter months longer than Vickie’s…<br />
Vickie placed her wish beside Jane and Laura’s and slid the door 
shut, a massive grin on her face. Of course, they didn’t believe it 
– they thought this was just a joke.<br />
 If they had cared they would have thought to ask what she had 
wished for.<br />
 But unlike them Vickie had faith.  </p>
<p>*Day 1  </p>
<p>Vickie woke up and nothing was different.<br />
 Well that wasn’t true. She felt light and refreshed, a little stronger 
and healthier than the day before. She didn’t notice it until she 
was halfway through breakfast, but she felt energized, healthier 
than ever. Normally getting out of bed in the morning was a slog 
but today she zipped through her morning routine with an extra 
spring in her step.<br />
 She just put it down to just being a good day.<br />
 She went to work on the bus, sat at her desk and answered 
emails for ninety minutes, before walking down to the sealed unit 
that the museum goods had been stashed in.<br />
 She then continued unpacking boxes, large unwieldy boxes that 
you needed a good grip on before shifting down from the storage 
unit before unpacking and sorting.<br />
 She lifted them down, unpacked and sorted the contents inside, 
before repacking them and loading back into the storage unit.  It 
was hard work, and usually by lunchtime she was sweating, but 
today she felt good about herself.<br />
 She had a big lunch, all that packing had given her an appetite, 
before there was a meeting with her supervisor that afternoon.<br />
It was a big meeting, discussing her funding, and she’d been 
dreading it for weeks….<br />
 Somehow though it wasn’t as bad as she’d been expecting. 
 He was unusually polite, and kind, and she was guaranteed at 
least another six months to write up. Just what she’d wanted! 
 She left work early, did some shopping on her way home, and 
went to bed feeling unusually content with the world.<br />
 In the lounge the Dream Chest, tucked away behind the sofa, 
stood silently.  </p>
<p>*Day 3  </p>
<p>On Wednesday Vickie arrived at work an hour early, completed 
all of her tasks by midday and spent the afternoon unboxing and 
cataloguing storage crates from the museum.<br />
 The crates, each as wide as her arms spread and just as tall, 
didn’t feel exactly light in her hands but they were incredibly easy 
to lift today, almost as though she was getting stronger.  For 
three days in a row she had felt more energised each morning, 
more capable of coping with whatever the day would throw at 
her.<br />
 Rather than get the bus home she decided to walk back.  It 
wasn’t too far, three quarters of an hour away, and she could 
swing by the supermarket and get some orange juice on her way 
back.<br />
 To her surprise she ended up jogging most of it; she felt 
incredibly light on her feet and still full of energy when she got 
home.<br />
 That night, at a quarter to midnight, her phone buzzed. She 
blinked and gazed bleary eyed at the screen. It was from Jane.   </p>
<p><strong><em>DATE FRIDAY!<br />
SUPER EXCITED!<br />
DRESS SHOPPING TOMORROW </em></strong>  </p>
<p>*Day 4  </p>
<p>“Wow girl, have you been working out?”<br />
 It was the first thing Jane said when she spotted Vickie in the 
shopping mall after work.<br />
 Vickie smiled self-consciously and ran a hand down the side of 
her dress, feeling the toned skin of her rib cage and the new 
muscle that was forming between her abs.<br />
 And though the scales said she’d put on several pounds she 
hadn’t actually even gone up a single dress size! Her muscles 
were still small, but they were dense.<br />
 She’d been feeling extremely good about herself all week.  At 
this point she was almost certain the Dream Chest had done its 
job. Thanks to her wish to be a stronger woman she’d started 
feeling stronger, more confident, more able than before.  She 
spent the next hour helping Jane carry out the impossible task 
of finding a dress both sexy, not sluttish, classy, not posh, and 
most importantly suitable for someone over six foot six.<br />
 All the time she quizzed Jane about the lucky man.<br />
 “Well it was really odd,” Jane laughed, “He just approached me 
in a bus queue. Normally I’d have laughed him off but, it’s been a 
while and he was absolutely gorgeous, so I thought… Why not 
treat yourself?”<br />
 “You deserve it,” Vickie smiled, nodding internally. It made 
sense. Jane had asked for men to find her size less intimidating 
and that true had come true, Proof that the Dream Chest 
worked!<br />
 But one of her closest friends had missed out on this opportunity! 
Penny had been busy all week with the relaunch of the store and 
still had no idea what was going on.<br />
 She’d have to do something about that.  </p>
<p>*Day 5  </p>
<p>That evening Penny was introduced to the Dream Chest.<br />
Vickie gazed lovingly down at the wooden box that had, in one 
solitary week, completely turned her life around.<br />
 She was eating more healthily, exercising more, sweating less…<br />
She felt like she could run a marathon and that was just her 
body. Colleagues were complementing her more, her boss had 
started to notice her, and she’d noticed that although her boobs 
were still tiny the better muscle definition on her torso made them 
stand out slightly more proudly.<br />
“So you’re saying that you wished to be a stronger woman and it 
came true?” Penny asked suspiciously, squinting up at her with 
one eye. “And Laura wished not to fall ill, and Jane to be less 
intimidating to men?”<br />
 “I asked Laura if she had a cold this morning and she hasn’t had 
one all week,” Vickie replied proudly. “Not that that proves 
anything.”<br />
 “But she’s never ill,” Penny replied incredulously, “And you’ve 
always been an athlete and Laura gets tonnes of dates with men.<br />
She practically has to fend them off with a stick.”<br />
 “No,” Vickie shook her head, a little taken aback at her friend’s 
outburst. “Laura is always ill. Do you remember her birthday last 
year? She spent a whole fortnight in bed and had to cancel her 
holiday…”<br />
 “She went to Ibiza,” Penny replied angrily. “You know she went 
to Ibiza, she was bragging about it for weeks, and there were<br />
those photos from the beach….”<br />
 “No, she was ill in bed,” Vickie frowned.<br />
 At this Penny pulled out her phone and started flicking 
backwards through her photographs. She found a photo of a 
woman wrapped in a towel (and literally only a towel) standing 
between four extremely tall, extremely bronzed, extremely proud 
looking men.  </p>
<p>Men who had probably never been so close to two of the natural 
wonders of the world, perky monster boobs straining against the 
towels knot. <br />
 Vickie starred at it for a moment, mentally processing the image.<br />
She had never laid eyes on it before but at the same time… it felt 
familiar.<br />
 “Laura... Topless beach… Ibiza… Last September?”  “Duhh,” 
Penny sighed, shaking her head like a disappointed teacher. 
“And you’ve been on a health fetish since you were 13; the only 
one of us who actually gets their money’s worth out of the gym 
membership!”<br />
 “But I don’t remember,” Vickie stared with confusion down at the 
wooden box.<br />
 Then something in the back of her head clicked and suddenly 
the situation seemed to make sense. Penny didn’t know about 
the wishes; she hadn’t been there on Sunday night.<br />
 For her the world had always been like that.<br />
 However, it was further proof that the Dream Chest worked. It 
was so efficient it didn’t just change the here and now but 
retroactively altered their history.  It wasn’t just her imagining 
things had changed – the world really was different.<br />
 Penny was staring at her fearfully.<br />
 “Vickie, I know you’re a little crazy at times, but you don’t have to 
make things up to impress me. What is this really about?”  “It’s 
about the fact I have a magic box that can grant wishes.”  “It can 
grant wishes,” Penny repeated sarcastically. “Seriously, you 
expect me to believe that?”<br />
 “Try it,” Vickie insisted, scrabbling for the post-it notes she kept 
on the fridge door. “Try writing something you’ve always dreamed 
of and putting it in this drawer. Tomorrow it will start to come 
true.”<br />
 “You’re mad,” Penny replied, throwing her hands in the air.  “Just 
do it,” Vickie insisted. “And don’t tell Jane or Laura about this. 
Wait a day then see if they notice what has changed – I don’t </p>
<p>think they will. It seems the only people who know about the 
wishes can see what’s changed. Jane noticed I was getting fitter, 
but she saw me put my wish into the chest.”<br />
 Vickie and Penny both wrote their own requests, then Vickie slid 
open the top drawer of the chest to reveal the three scribbled 
notes from the previous weekend.<br />
 Carefully Vickie removed her own, leaving Jane and Laura’s in 
there, added the two new notes and closed the drawer shut.<br />
Then, with a contented smile, she slotted her completed wish into 
the sealed compartment. Her body was singing with anticipation 
of what was to come…<br />
 She wouldn’t be the only flat chested member of the group for 
long!  </p>
<p>*Day 6  </p>
<p>Vickie’s phone was ringing.<br />
 The room was dark, there wasn’t even a hint of sunlight behind 
the curtains, but her phone was screeching for her to wake up.<br />
Bleary eyed she fumbled for the handset at the side of the bed 
and saw that Penny was ringing her. Why the fuck was Penny 
ringing her this early? Without even rolling over she pulled the 
mobile onto the bed and put it on loudspeaker; “What time in the 
morning is it?”<br />
 “It’s 4 AM,” Penny’s tinny screech filled the room, far too loudly. 
“It’s 4 AM and there’s a hundred fucking thousand pounds in my<br />
bank account! Vickie, I’m fucking rich!”  “It 
worked then,” Vickie replied with a grin.<br />
 She resisted the urge to pull her hands up to her chest and feel 
her own progress. Instead she rolled over to get more 
comfortable, and she immediately felt her arm brush against 
some flesh that definitely hadn’t been there the night before. “You 
didn’t believe me but I told you it would work.”<br />
 “Too fucking right it worked,” Penny cackled like a mad woman. 
“But only you and I know that this is because of your wish box? 
As far as Jane and Laura will be concerned I will always have 
been rich? I’ve been looking at pictures on my phone history and 
I’ve got shots of both of them trying on posh frocks and dresses 
that look waaaaaay too expensive.”<br />
 “That’s what I guess will happen; we’ll find out,” Penny tried to 
blink sleep out of her eyes. She popped her legs over the side of 
the bed and padded over to the nearest mirror.<br />
 “Well I’ve got three weeks holiday saved up,” Penny cried 
delightedly. “I’m driving down to the airport, parking my car and 
getting on the first plane to Barbados. I’ll be back in three weeks!<br />
Fancy coming with me?”<br />
 “I can’t take three weeks off without notice,” Vickie scoffed; “I 
have a paper due!”  </p>
<p>“What do you mean? You have a magic box that grants wishes, 
magic the work done and come with me,” Penny laughed madly. 
“I’m going to invite Jane and Laura, see if they bat an eyelid 
when I tell them I’ve already paid for their tickets. If you change 
your mind ring me back by 9.”<br />
 Hanging up Vickie put the phone down, then reached for her 
pyjama top. She lifted, slowly, carefully, eyes wide as she looked 
down at her naked breasts. She felt friction against the fabric that 
normally wasn’t there.<br />
 It wasn’t a big increase, in fact they didn’t look so much bigger 
as more defined, but it was real. She had spent so long staring 
mournfully down at them that she was certain they had changed! 
 For the first time since a very disappointing puberty Vickie 
Spencer was growing tits! 
 They poked out from her petite frame, retaining their natural 
firmness to give her some amazing cleavage! 
 Nothing at all compared to her friends but for her this was 
amazing. Vickie was ecstatic! 
 She spent most of the day topless in her house marvelling at the 
fact she had a full, womanly bust! 
 The sensation of swaying weight in her chest was new and she 
marvelled in every moment. The only downside she had noticed 
was her nipples and aureoles were extremely sensitive. 
 She couldn’t wear a shirt as the sensation of fabric brushing 
across her breasts set pulses of pleasure rushing through her 
body! 
 She found herself caressing her newly expanded aureoles, her 
fingers slowly moving towards her puffy nipples, holding them 
tight between her fingertips, squeezing and pulling on them 
alternately as she worked herself into a fervour. 
 As the sun set and night fell Vickie realised she had masturbated 
the day away without getting a single productive thing done! 
 But fucking hell she still felt good. 
 Tomorrow though would have to be different…  </p>
<p>*Day 7  </p>
<p>Vickie rose early on Sunday, excited for a very specific purpose, 
a direction she had decided on the night before settling down to 
bed.<br />
 She ate breakfast, hands eagerly searching out the fresh folds in 
her pliant flesh that was building beneath her top. 
 The skin was taut but not painful, every brush and caress a new 
wave of pleasure. She was still small enough to walk around 
unsupported without feeling more than a gentle sway but that 
wouldn’t last much longer.<br />
 On a whim, because it was the weekend and because she 
wanted to enjoy her new assets, she had gone braless all day.<br />
She revelled in feeling her breasts moving independently as she 
wandered around the house, the little jump they made when she 
flopped down on the sofa or the rubbing against her forearm 
when she tried to move her arms forward forgetting they were 
there… It had been fun at first but by bedtime she could feel 
them pulling at her ribcage. And the constant slight irritation from 
her shirt had set her nipples to hard and they hadn’t gone down 
until she’d turned in for the night.<br />
 At 8 AM she left the house expectantly, more than an hour to 
wait before her appointment, but she knew the walk, then train, to 
the supermarket would fly by. The whole time she was grinning 
ear to ear, waiting for conformation of what she already knew.<br />
She arrived ten minutes early and waited eagerly to be let into 
the brassier. An elderly woman opened up at 9:00 exactly and 
led her through to the back room, instructing her to strip down to 
her bra and wait for her to fetch her tape measure.<br />
 Vickie held her arms up excitedly as the woman passed the tape 
measure around her shoulders then pushed it down into position 
snugly against her bust. After a few more positions, numbers 
being jotted down, and then another repeat of the first 
measurements it was done.  </p>
<p>“34 D,” the woman declared confidently.<br />
 Vickie’s heart swelled with pride.<br />
 “So there’s no need to change size,” the woman replied 
condescendingly, “Unless you were just retaining water when you 
rang yesterday. This is exactly the same as your current bra.” <br />
Vickie opened her mouth to disagree then frowned. She glanced 
down at the fitted bra she had put on that morning without 
thinking about it. It didn’t feel tight, or clingy, just extremely 
comfortable and fitted. Why hadn’t she realized? Not only had 
she grown but all of her bras had changed with her.<br />
 There was no need to come back here and get measured; she 
could check her progress simply by examining the tags on her 
clothing.<br />
 “I guess I was just panicking,” she apologized, smiling at the 
woman. “I need to get some more anyway so it’s not been a 
wasted trip.”<br />
 All of the bras in her wardrobe were functional at best. As she 
had no chest to speak of she had never gone in for fancy lingerie 
before. Now that she had something to show off that would have 
to change.<br />
 She spent nearly an hour trying on a variety of styles and 
colours, marvelling at the way different shapes lifted and cupped 
her new assets. And in almost all of them she looked fucking 
awesome!<br />
 Sexy bras purchased she headed back home, and as she 
walked her phone beeped to inform her she had a voicemail 
message. Plucking the phone from her pocket she was surprised 
to hear a message from Penny.<br />
 “Good news – safely arrived on beach. Record store is doing 
fine – just checked our sales figures and it’s never been so 
profitable! It will be safe until I get back.<br />
 Am alone as Jane has hot date and Laura’s on shift for the rest 
of the week. I also checked my bank account and there’s almost 
triple the cash in my account compared to yesterday! I was rich </p>
<p>before but now I’m over halfway to being a fucking billionaire!<br />
When I get back, just want to say I owe you! I owe you big time. 
Tell me what you want me to buy and it is yours girl!”  Vickie just 
smiled and pocketed her phone.<br />
Her suspicions were confirmed – as long as you left the wishes 
in the box they would repeat. And just as every day over the last<br />
week she had gotten stronger, now every day coming her boobs 
were growing!   </p>
<p>*Day 8  </p>
<p>Vickie woke up and rolled over, feeling her arm brush against 
new flesh that hadn’t been there the night before!<br />
 She sat up quickly and looked down at her naked breasts, proud 
and jiggling on her torso. She cupped her hands over her 
breasts, which were now large enough that they filled her hands 
completely.<br />
 A quick check of the bras hanging in her closet confirmed that 
the wish had changed her surroundings as well as her body, with 
each label proclaiming her new size of 34 DD.<br />
 Standing naked before the mirror she admired how these once 
small (or not so small) additions to her lithe body completely 
changed her shape. 
 They were round, and proud, and heavy! Their slight, but not 
prominent sag, meant her nipples no longer pointed proudly 
skywards but drooped towards the floor. 
 She got dressed and felt that her boobs were finally filling out her 
shirts properly. She spent the rest of the day with her head held 
high, although it was a quiet day doing jobs around the house so 
there was no-one to admire her new form. <br />
 Her schedule was too busy to really explore what her new body 
would be like, so she headed out of her apartment and to her 
work. <br />
She had arranged to meet Jane for lunch and it would be a 
fantastic opportunity to see whether her other friend had noticed 
her new developments. It would also be a chance to find out how 
date night had gone.<br />
 Laura was still the ‘largest’ of the group – but now only by just a 
few cup sizes.<br />
 Since Friday Vickie’s boobs had caught up with Jane and Penny 
just leaving ‘Tit’ania herself to pass.<br />
 That wouldn’t come for a while yet but the unthinkable was now 
within sight…  </p>
<p>When they arrived at the cafe Jane looked different.<br />
 She was dressed more conservatively than normal. It took Vickie 
a moment to realise what it was but as her friend sat down 
opposite her in the cafe she realized just how many layers the 
woman had on.<br />
 Jane’s clothes were baggy, wider and drabber. She was 
dressing to try and hider her bust. That was difficult when your 
extra height naturally brought them up to most men’s eye level.<br />
Vickie glanced around and realized that almost every man in the 
cafe was staring at them. But this was different to normal. Intent 
gazes flickering from herself to her friend, with her it was passive 
but when they turned to Jane there was something predatory 
about them.<br />
 “You’re looking as healthy as ever,” was her friends opening 
remarks. Vickie blushed but before she could thank her Jane 
gave a worried glance around the room. “Sorry I can’t stay long.<br />
I… I feel a little self-conscious here.”<br />
 “You’ve never been self-conscious before,” said Vickie as she 
sipped at her late. There was a long pause before at last she had 
to ask; “So…. How did date night go?”<br />
 “It was fine,” Jane said, shrugging. She had never looked so 
awkward before in her life.  “It was good… I think… So… I really 
liked it until he started groping my tits in the taxi home.”  Vickie 
rolled her eyes but Jane glared at her to hold back the snide 
remark.<br />
 “This wasn’t normal. A quick feel in the taxi is one thing but he 
wasn’t subtle at all. He practically tried to rip my top off. The Taxi 
driver was watching, and we knew he was watching, but the dude 
was shameless. I was up for it at first but it got out of control 
and…. Well, the Taxi Driver started egging him on. It was like the 
two of them were in on something and I was just stuck there, 
waiting to get home, a fantastic date suddenly turned into 
something awful in just a second. It wasn’t normal.”  </p>
<p>“He sounds like a sicko.” Vickie shook her head, amazed. “I’m so 
sorry, you were so excited. Did he apologise? Have you reported 
him?”<br />
 “No. I just got out the taxi and slammed the door on him. He was 
really apologetic afterwards, I think he realized what he had 
done, sent me a text message to say he didn’t know what had 
come over him. I said fine but I never want to see him again. The 
thing is…. He’s not the only one,” Jane grumbled. “I mean, I get 
stared at, I always have. But this last week something has 
changed. At first I just got more smiles, more nods, more 
wandering eyes. I can cope with wandering eyes. I ‘like’ 
wondering eyes. But over the last three days its changed.”  She 
leant back in her chair and cast her eyes around the room. And 
as she did Vickie realized just how wrong this situation had 
become.<br />
 Normally when you make eye contact with a leering man they 
turn away and try to pretend that they hadn’t been sneaking a 
look. Some of the more confident men would smile, maybe wink 
or at least shrug and give an apologetic nod that they had been 
caught out.<br />
 Men were gonna look. 
 With things that big and that prominent it was just going to 
happen. But today?<br />
 Every man who was leering (openly leering, not trying to hide it 
at all) at Jane’s chest met her gaze head on. They didn’t even 
acknowledge she had caught them. They just carried on with this 
predatory half smile, half longing gaze pointed straight at her 
friend.<br />
 She was almost more a slab of meat on display than a woman. 
 “I think it’s your bloody wishing box,” Jane said at last. “I didn’t 
believe it at first but I wished men would be less afraid of me. 
Well they are less afraid now and I don’t like it. It’s gone too far 
the other way. I’ve felt it get worse every day since Thursday and<br />
I want it to stop.”  </p>
<p>“You wished men would be less afraid of you?” Vickie repeated, 
shaking her head as she recalled. And as she’d intuited the 
wishes were repeating – each and every day. Eight days had 
now passed and each time Jane had become a little less 
intimidating. 
 Less… respected? 
 Oops.<br />
 “Its… Well, yes. Okay. I see the logic.”<br />
“How do we stop this?” 
 “You are meant to move the paper into the lower drawer when 
your wish comes true,” Vickie said slowly. “I haven’t bothered 
moving any of our wishes down – I left them where they were, 
and I think the wishes have been repeating themselves. Every 
night I’ve felt a little stronger than before.”<br />
“You look like an athlete,” Jane smiled, flicking her hair back 
from her face. “Well, except for your front. It’s like all the fat in 
your body coalesced inside your bra.” 
 “I need to move the wishes down,” Vickie nodded; “That will stop 
this getting worse. But can we undo this? You’d need to make a 
new wish.”<br />
 “That makes sense,” said Jane hopefully, a hopeful smile briefly 
appearing. “I can undo this!”<br />
 “But be careful! Think carefully about it because you don’t want 
to make the situation worse.”<br />
 “I’ll think about it,” Jane replied thoughtfully. “I like the attention 
when it’s respectful but the last two days have just been too 
much. A checkout assistant called me ‘tall jugs’ when he was 
scanning my groceries yesterday. He wasn’t ashamed at all 
about it. If this is what ‘no fear’ means I’ve made a terrible 
mistake.”<br />
 “It’ll get better,” Vickie promised her. The tension settled 
somewhat, although their audience had not gone away Jane 
seemed content to have shared her anxiety.  </p>
<p>They chatted for a few more minutes until it was nearly time for 
them to head back to work but both agreed to meet after work for 
Jane to put in a new wish.<br />
 Her friend spent the afternoon locked in her office trying to find 
the best wording for the new wish and come up with the perfect 
compromise.<br />
 Vickie spent the afternoon trying not to fantasise about how big 
her boobs would be tomorrow. She sent a text asking Laura if 
she was free for lunch – she just HAD to compare sizes. 
 When she got home Vickie opened the drawer and removed all 
but one of the previous wishes, the one about her boobs, and 
slotted them in the lower drawer.<br />
 Wishes fulfilled!<br />
 Then Jane arrived with a new one ‘men will admire but also 
respect me and my wishes’ and inserted that in the top. Hopefully 
if that was allowed to repeat for a few days they would get some 
semblance of normality.<br />
Everyone could come out of this a winner!  </p>
<p>*Day 9  </p>
<p>Vickie examined her new oversized bras the next morning with a 
smile on her face. 
 She’d outgrown skimpy lingerie apparently and begun to move 
towards solid, construction grade scaffolding. The straps were 
wide brimmed, designed to spread the weight over her shoulders 
evenly, and the cups wide and full to both lift and support. 
 The magic had changed her entire wardrobe to fit the new 
woman; still sporty but with the twist that every top had to fit her 
new bust. 
 Almost as a guide there were photos on the wall of her in 
running clothes with the straps of three, separate sports bras 
visible through her skimpy top. Certainly her drawers were full of 
the things; the evidence indicating she went through them faster 
than ever before. 
 She tried one of the mammoth boulder holders on, did a few test 
star jumps, and grinned her way through the pain of over-
stretched skin as they flopped around wildly in front of her. 
 From now on it looked like she’d be double, or even triple, 
bagging it she ever wanted to move above a medium pace and 
not wobble everywhere! 
 At lunch the cafe was less busy than the previous day…<br />
 Without Jane in the room it had a much calmer atmosphere – the 
only tension or starring was the normal eye-magnets that both 
Vickie and Laura sported on their chests.<br />
 People couldn’t NOT stare – it would just be rude to let these two 
wonders of nature pass without a glance!<br />
 And somehow Laura had no idea that Vickie was still growing! 
From the way the conversation was going it appeared her friend 
thought they had been the ‘busty duo’ since college!  Vickie had 
to hold back tears of joy thinking about what was going to 
happen next!  </p>
<p>Penny and Jane were both true believers in the Dream Chest 
now, but busty Laura was still sceptical. She didn’t even 
mention the dream chest until Vickie brought it up. 
 “You do look a little healthier,” Laura said, frowning at her 
friend but doubt still clear on her face. With squinting eyes and 
a furrowed brow; “If you’ve been working out at the gym over 
the last few months to play some kind of elaborate prank …” 
 “No prank,” Vickie retorted, “Check your social media account 
Laura; there’s photos of your trip to Ibiza last year that never 
happened because you were ill.” 
 “Hmmm….” Laura said with a furrowed brow. 
 The girl had always had problems admitting when she was 
wrong. This wouldn’t be any different. 
 “Out of curiosity… I’ve been thinking about… Maybe… Wishing 
for a different enhancement myself.”<br />
 Her eyes flickered downwards at her burgeoning (but practically 
flat compared to Laura’s) chest.<br />
 “A boost?” Laura asked, “Why girl? You’ve got the dream 
package; curves and muscles. Beneath this dress I’m just all flab 
but you?”<br />
 She hadn’t noticed. She hadn’t noticed that she’d gone from 
nearly an ironing board to a double D in just four days.  So 
that proved it; only people who saw you putting the wish in 
would be aware of the changes. As far as the world was 
concerned things had always been this way.<br />
 “I just wandered what it was like to have KK boobs?” she said, “I 
mean, this is an opportunity of a lifetime, and I’ve always admired 
you.”<br />
 “I’m a freak,” Laura laughed. 
 It was a deep belly laugh and the two pendulums on her front 
shuddered with amplified momentum. Vickie couldn’t help herself 
but watch, wondering how long it would take for the monster 
boobs to stop trembling. </p>
<p>“Seriously? You don’t want these girl; you couldn’t handle them! 
And I don’t know if I could be friends with someone bigger than 
me. I always got on with you three because your ‘big enough’ to 
know what I’m going through but not threaten my place as the 
queen of tits.”<br />
 “You’re proud of that title?”<br />
“I’m fucking ‘Tit’ania,” Laura replied, sticking her tongue out at 
her friend. “That fucking nickname didn’t happen by accident, I 
knew these things would dominate my personality, so I forced a 
title I wanted. It was difficult, growing up with these things, getting 
re-fitted every six months, but once I had found some bras that 
actually fitted, actually held my bust up where they should be, I 
loved it. I love myself.”<br />
 “You say we know what it’s like, but we don’t,” Vickie prodded. 
“What’s it really like being off the deep end of the bra size 
catalogue?”<br />
 Laura sighed. “Well, I keep having to buy clothes too big and get 
them altered – off the shelf they fit my bust but swamp my waist. 
And I constantly have to fiddle with bra straps that are digging in, 
or sometimes double up on bras just to hold me up and prevent 
spillage. I have to exercise constantly and watch what I eat 
because they swell painfully if I over-indulge. There’s boob sweat 
in the summer which is awful… It’s a pain. But it’s all me; I love it. 
Now push off and stop asking intimate questions. What’s come 
over you girl?”<br />
 “I’m just wondering about the wishing box,” Vickie said idly, “And 
now our first wishes have come true what we could do with it.” 
 “You’ve turned into a fucking athlete and I appear to be 
impervious to disease,” Laura replied with a laugh; “And poor 
Jane… That thing is dangerous Vickie – my advice would be to 
take this as a win and walk away!” <br />
 “Hmmm,” Vickie replied, grinning on the inside because she dare 
not let ‘Tit’ania know the truth. “Perhaps your right.” 
 The irony was just too delicious. </p>
<p>They got up, gave each other a quick hug (both leaning 
ridiculously far over to avoid boob smotherage) and then Laura 
took her handbag with her to the bathroom. Men around the cafe 
watched her go longingly.<br />
 Just not quite as longingly as they had followed Jane yesterday!<br />
Vickie left through the front doors, copping a quick feel of her 
own chest as she went, wondering how many days it would take 
for her to catch up with her old friend.  </p>
<p>*Day 10  </p>
<p>Vickie climbed out of bed eager for the day even though the sun 
had yet to rise. 
 The clock on the wall told her it was 5 AM – it seemed she only 
needed a few hours’ sleep now. One boon that the dream chest 
had granted her. 
 The other boons stood proud on her chest, their bulk one of the 
reasons she was on her feet so soon. All her life she had tossed 
and turned in her sleep but now… Now if she turned to lie on her 
front she couldn’t last long. 
 Well, loosing the ability to sleep face down was a worthy 
sacrifice for what she was gaining. 
 She took stock of what the last week had brought. She had 
become an endowed goddess; a woman in peak physical fitness 
bragging 36E boobage. Despite the present weight on her 
ribcage she felt light on her feet, her muscles toned and ready for 
action.<br />
 Her skin was perfect; most of her freckles had gone and the 
ones that remained were smaller and lighter. Her hair was 
glorious whether she showered or not.  She was fitter than she 
had ever been in her life.<br />
 Jane was now far less intimidating to men but hopefully with her 
new wish she would also find some safety. 
 Apparently, the fine line between ‘intimidatingly tall’ and ‘sex 
prey’ was a thin one indeed but if they left this new wish repeat a 
few times things should get better.<br />
 Jane had reported that she was fine. Apparently, a flu was going 
around the maternity ward but she hadn’t caught it. In fact, 
according to her medical records, she hadn’t taken a day off sick 
in her entire career.<br />
 And Penny was still in Ibiza and had reported that her bank 
account had finally settled at $80,432,000. She was a little miffed </p>
<p>when Vickie told her she had removed the wish and that would 
be it however 80 million was hardly a number to sniff at.<br />
 Vickie stood wearing just a bra before her bedroom mirror and 
began to stretch. She watched her new athlete’s body with a 
critical eye as she went through a variety of poses, limbering 
herself up for the day ahead. It was like watching a Greek 
goddess at work; curves, muscles and tits!<br />
 In just over a week their worlds had changed completely, and it 
was AWESOME!<br />
 But she wasn’t quite where she wanted to be yet. She’d leave 
the Dream Chest a few more days before she declared her 
wishes complete.  </p>
