<p>Upper Management 3 </p>
<p>The sound of a gently-tolling bell woke Cora from her slumber. Following the hours that she and 
Vanessa had spent exploring one another’s bodies she had been in deep need of rest. Little else 
had been explored in the newly-reformed building other than the existence of a custom mattress 
on the second floor. Much to the amazon’s disappointment Vanessa was nowhere to be found. 
She reached over to dismiss her phone’s alarm and noticed she’d received a text from Vanessa. </p>
<p>Cora’s face went beet red and her heart fluttered. Setting the phone down, she set about to begin 
her day by exploring how much the world had changed. In addition to turning part of the bank’s 
headquarters into her own personal loft everything was sized for her. The shower, the soaps, and 
the towels were all custom-designed for a 7’1” giantess with breasts the size of her head, an ass 
the size of a couch cushion and muscles worthy of a fitness model. </p>
<p>For the morning, Cora decided to stay nude under the assumption nobody would bother her. She 
sat at her computer located on the first floor. The keyboard was the only appliance not sized for 
her fingers, forcing her to resort to hunting-and-pecking one key at a time. </p>
<p>First, Cora discovered that she was no longer VP but in fact the sole owner and proprietor of the 
bank. Second, she found that the ‘no more taxes’ portion of her wish had increased just as the 
rest of her had. The universe, apparently, interpreted the improvement of not paying taxes as the 
IRS paying her an exorbitant amount of money over time. Her immense fortune allowed her to 
purchase and rename the bank to ‘CoraBank.’ </p>
<p>“It has a nice ring to it,” Cora said to herself. The last thing she checked was on Vanessa, 
assuming she would have gone up the corporate ladder as well. Instead, she found that Vanessa 
was still in her prior role of floor manager. Such a tangled mess of corporate hierarchy sat above 
her girlfriend that she made an executive decision. Vanessa went directly to President of 
Marketing with the press of a few buttons. Just then, her phone went off again as another text 
from Vanessa arrived. </p>
<p>When another text didn’t arrive explaining the outburst Cora set her phone aside. She strode into 
the massive closet and changed into a simple black pantsuit and black flats. Her ample curves 
were still plainly visible packed into this outfit, but it was better than venturing out in public 
naked. Yet again her phone began to rumble but to her surprise it wasn’t Vanessa. The called ID 
simply said “Trevor” which she assumed this reality’s Cora knew much better. </p>
<p>“Hello?” Cora asked into the receiver. </p>
<p>“Good morning! This is Trevor, with security. Do you have a moment to speak?” he asked. </p>
<p>“Er, yeah? I mean, yes,” Cora self-corrected. </p>
<p>“Excellent. You may be aware that we recently opened a new commercial branch?” Trevor 
paused a moment then continued, “well, we’ve received reports of an ongoing armed robbery at 
that location.” </p>
<p>“Oh, that’s terrible! Have the police been called?” a fearful shiver ran down Cora’s spine. Some 
odd sense of dread regarding the reason she, specifically, was being notified was forming. </p>
<p>“Yes, ma’am, I just thought you should hear from me,” Trevor sighed shakily, “that, uhm, we’ve 
been informed that the new President of Marketing is present at that location.” </p>
<p>“Send me that branch’s address,” Cora demanded brusquely. Without delay she then 
disconnected the call and took her leave. Dread had turned to fury; she was partially emboldened 
by her confidence in what her body could do even against armed criminals. On her way out she 
found that her compact sedan had been replaced by a large truck meant to accommodate her size. 
Her phone buzzed once more with another text, but it was in her pockets and she had other 
concerns demanding her attention. </p>
<p>On the way to the bank branch Cora risked numerous collisions; she sped through red lights and 
swerved across lanes of traffic like her life depended on it. To her, Vanessa’s did, and that 
superseded all other concerns. Finally, she arrived to the scene of numerous police cruisers 
parked outside the bank. A team of armored SWAT officers seemed to be conversing. She strode 
past them and stepped over their barricades, eliciting shouts for her to stop. None of them could, 
and their only effort was verbal.  </p>
<p>“Well, go find her!” one of the masked men shouted. This was the first utterance Cora heard 
upon striding into the bank. Though she had to duck to fit through the door the building was 
rather large for a bank branch and had at least two stories. The criminal that had been instructed 
to search the building left, but as she stepped forward all attention in the room fell upon her. </p>
<p>All of the day’s customers, security guards and staff were gathered on the ground in front of the 
counters. Seven criminals wielding rifles of some kind stared at the large woman but wasted no 
time in training their weapons upon Cora. She hadn’t actually tested if she was somehow more 
durable and it occurred to her this might hurt. Worse, she couldn’t see Vanessa in the crowd. She 
assumed when the apparent ringleader said ‘her’ that he was referring to Vanessa. </p>
<p>“Oh, hey, who ordered the candy?” a criminal called out. A fit of chuckles broke out among the 
would-be thieves. Just as Cora started to step forward the bank’s intercom system relayed a 
buzzing feedback signal. </p>
<p>“You know,” a feminine voice cut through the feedback, “I love her, I really do. I just..” </p>
<p>“Vanessa?!” Cora cried out frantically. Rationally, she knew that Vanessa probably couldn’t hear 
her, but couldn’t help from expressing herself nonetheless. Just then, she remembered that she’d 
received a test and immediately checked her phone. It had doubled in size, fortunately, but it was 
still awkward to use a touch screen with huge fingers. A look of surprise crossed her face and she 
put her phone away. </p>
<p>“I just feel like she’s missing something,” Vanessa continued, “I mean, Cora is such a small 
name. Is it short for anything?” </p>
<p>A familiar tingling built up within Cora. Though it hadn’t begun yet she knew what was coming. 
A smile spread across her face. She centered her attention back on the robbers. </p>
<p>“I know everybody will agree with me when I say that Cora could just be…” Vanessa seemed to 
pause purposely. Cora’s heart began fluttering, she clenched her fists and shut her eyes. </p>
<p>“Much, much bigger,” Vanessa finished the thought. This time, in full view of a room of people, 
Cora felt her body being stretched. The growth was different, however; she presumed it may 
have been because reality was having to adapt in real time. </p>
<p>All of Cora’s body began to pulse with each beat of her heart. Her breasts began pushing further 
out of her button-up blouse. She had only created large indentations before, but spaces between 
the buttons began to form. Mountainous cleavage was immediately visible between the spaces in 
her top, which grew more numerous each second. Her breasts puffed up out of her blouse’s 
neckline, threatening to brush the bottom of her chin by the massive bra constraining them. </p>
<p>Cora’s breasts quickly delivered on their threat. An expanse of cleavage could be seen over her 
shirt’s neckline, and through many straining buttons. With an audible snap her bra was snapped 
by the ceaseless discharge of boob, and then vanished from her top completely. Each tit 
gradually swelled past twice the size of her head. Another pulse ran through her body and her 
shirt broke open completely. The motion of being freed caused her tits to sway and jiggle. Still, 
they rode high on her chest as they made one final push. </p>
<p>All the while Cora had been expanding upward with staggering spurts. She began to massage her 
breasts, tweaking her nipples as she felt her powerful body become ever greater. A pop echoed 
throughout the chamber, and then another. Her ass and hips were pushing outward inches at a 
time. While her thighs thickened, too, she maintained a visible gap between them. </p>
<p>The perspective of Cora’s audience was skewed; confusing, to say the least. When she’d first 
walked in the crooks were eye-level with her shoulders. Their eyes rose higher and higher, some 
focused on her astounding tits, others on her hips, and others still trying to get a better look at her 
perfectly round ass. There was enough glorious booty that just a portion could be seen peeking 
out from behind. </p>
<p>Still, Cora’s body continued its conquest upward. The ever-towering woman began to step 
towards the perpetrators. Her muscular arms and shoulders burst out of the blouse and blazer. </p>
<p>Long, firm legs tore her business slacks to shreds. Everybody in the room, with the exception of 
the growing giantess, began to question how she had entered the bank to begin with. </p>
<p>Then, the building’s concrete walls began to twist and groan. The doors soared upward, the 
ceiling rose and the branch itself seem to double in size. A white camisole appeared over Cora’s 
breasts which defied any bra manufacturer to create something that could contain them. To an 
average-sized person they were as large as a beanbag chair, but twice as soft to the touch despite 
their high position on her chest. </p>
<p>A flowery skirt manifested over Cora’s waist, leaving several handfuls off buttock hanging out 
for all to see. Sandals appeared over her massive feet, decorated with a little flower sticking out 
of the top strap. At the end of the spurt the assailants stood just a few inches taller than her waist. 
A massive, powerful arm shot out and grabbed one of them by the legs. A moment of fear 
washed over the giantess when the others opened fire. She braced for impact. </p>
<p>“Oh, fuck me,” Cora heard the ringleader lament. Opening her eyes, she found that she had not 
in fact been gunned down. Flattened bullets littered the floor in front of her, having struck 
against her body and simply fallen from her flawless skin. Her clothing, however, hadn’t been so 
lucky as the rest of her and sported a few more bullet holes than before. The predatory grin 
returned as she pulled the criminal she’d apprehended up to her full height. </p>
<p>A heavy ‘thump’ echoed throughout the room as Cora flung him into the concrete wall behind 
her. He slid down onto the ground, motionless. Hands on her generous hips, she sighed 
triumphantly and leaned down in front of her impotent attackers. The cleavage put on display as 
she moved was beyond mountainous; the top managed to push her boobs together without 
breaking, causing them to nearly burst from the neckline even when standing. By leaning over, 
the fraction of boob she revealed was itself large enough for an adult person to sleep on. </p>
<p>“Run,” Cora purred. Without hesitation the troop of crooks turned tail and ran. A few cheers rang 
out from the captive audience. As their gigantic savior began to stalk her prey the former 
hostages began to clear out of the building. At the conclusion of the readjustment, it appeared 
that the entire building had been designed from the ground-up to fit Cora in every nook and 
cranny. </p>
<p>Heavy footsteps echoed off the walls as Cora tracked her quarry. She was navigating the back 
offices of the branch. There were a few closets and corners that made decent hiding spots. When 
she closed her eyes to listen, she could faintly hear the sound of panicked breathing somewhere 
in the hallway. </p>
<p>“I’m not trying to suggest that size is everything, by the way,” Vanessa’s voice returned to the 
intercom system, “I said I loved her and I meant it!” </p>
<p>Cora stuck her head through the massive doorway to a conference room but didn’t notice 
anybody within. Hearing Vanessa’s voice continued to fill her chest with butterflies; her ears 
burned bright red. </p>
<p>“But, if there’s more Cora, there’s more to love, right? I have so much love to give, and she’s 
just too small to handle it all!” Vanessa decreed proudly. </p>
<p>With each step Cora took her body took up more space in the hallway. A mountain of boob 
poured into her top. Her ass and hips billowed outward, pushing her skirt up and out until it was 
less clothing and more a suggestion of what could have been. She meant to continue her search 
but the feeling of her body pulsing and pumping all on its own was beginning to overwhelm her. 
For the first time since she had made the wish a desire manifested in her thoughts: to never stop 
growing. </p>
<p>For the time being Cora’s body would arousingly manifest her desires. A shuddering pulse 
caused her body to bloom upward and outward. She stopped, concerned about fitting in the 
hallway without realizing the tight corridor she’d chosen. With her back against the wall, she 
paused to slip a hand into her tingling sex. Her movements became more vigorous as she felt 
herself push more deeply into the wall and floor beneath. </p>
<p>A moan erupted from Cora’s soft, pillowy lips as she continued massaging herself. She raised 
her other arm to begin fondling her breasts again but flexed her inexorable muscles just a little 
too hard. The camisole tore setting her breasts tumbling free. Another shiver pushed her breasts 
ahead an inch, and then another. Still invested in herself, literally, she hadn’t noticed her ongoing 
developments until her breasts pushed into the wall opposite from her. </p>
<p>The sound of a masculine gasp echoing throughout the hallway tore Cora from her conundrum. 
Fury at the attackers for threatening Vanessa overwhelmed her arousal. The building shift again, 
releasing her just as she returned to the task at hand. A sports bra molded itself over her chest 
and a tight pair of shorts manifested on her bottom. Her hair swayed and shifted until it draped 
over her head just enough to cover one eye, otherwise hanging down her back just above her 
buttocks. </p>
<p>A golden light had begun to shine from Cora’s eyes. The building finished reshaping, once again 
much larger, which also left the crook exposed in the middle of the hallway. Confusion flooded 
his mind as he tried to understand why he had thought standing in the middle of the enormous 
hallway was a good idea. The giantess approaching him dwarfed him by several feet; at full 
attention the top of his head was just barely level with the smooth curves at the top of her 
buttocks. </p>
<p>A foot half the size of the crook’s torso launched him through the air. Cora watched him crash 
into the concrete hard enough that she heard the telltale cracking of breaking bones. Without 
bothering to pay him any more mind she continued to walk through the bank’s back area. It had 
increased in size enough that a full staff and call center could fit within. She saw the very back of 
one of the assailants hurry into empty call center. </p>
<p>“But I’m just so nervous, y’know,” Vanessa began speaking over the intercom once again. Cora 
stopped her pursuit to fully inspect her surroundings. She soon found herself staring into a 
camera mounted high on the ceiling. Furtively, she confirmed that she was alone in the hallway 
and looked back at the camera. Once confident she was alone, she vigorously waved both her </p>
<p>arms and jumped up and down. The motion sent her enormous boobs, each nearly the size of a 
full-grown average adult, into an avalanche of jiggling. </p>
<p>“Because the world is a big place! And it’s not easy for a woman to make it out unscathed,” 
Vanessa said. </p>
<p>While Cora’s sports bra was itself an incredible feat of textile craftsmanship, her incredible 
pectoral muscles combined with the sheer volume of boob meant very few if any top could truly 
contain her. She stopped her jumping and flashed her bare breasts at the camera with a wink. 
Then, she made a heart-shape with her hands, blew the camera a kiss and took her leave. </p>
<p>“I don’t want Cora to get hurt by what’s out there. I want her to be safe. I need my little shorty to 
be safe,” Vanessa’s voice seemed to quiver. </p>
<p>To Cora’s chagrin the cubicles seemed designed with her height in mind. The desks were 
obscured with walls tall enough to block her vision on all but one side. Even inactive, the sound 
of humming machinery would make it difficult to track her prey by sound. That same euphoric 
feeling began to take over her desire to hunt this crook down. She felt her hips pushing further 
into the custom-tailored shorts wrapped around them. More delicious flesh poured into her 
buttocks; her ass rounded out with more plump, grabbable skin each second. </p>
<p>Cora felt her boobs shift in her top but the growth, this time, seemed to be focused more on her 
lower half. The previous spurt had left her somewhat top heavy and the magic was still 
interpreting her wish in the most beneficial way possible. A lifetime’s worth of squats began 
manifesting on her ass, ensuring it was firm enough to bounce a hubcap off of it. </p>
<p>Cora’s hips swayed with every movement she made, even while she was standing still. Her 
thighs plumped up another inch, and then another. Her legs stretched longer, and longer still until 
the average person would come up to her thighs. Her body broadened in order to support the 
ever-growing assets. Her figure had initially begun to become an hourglass, but as it continued to 
grow virtually no part of her was hiding another. While Cora’s waist was still small it remained 
at a size appropriate for a woman of her level of fitness. Her musculature gained no mass but 
instead became increasingly pliant with time. A full school of gymnasts and ballet dancers’ 
worth of agility seeped into her body. </p>
<p>Though it pained Cora to do so, she dismissed the rising tide of arousal in favor of finishing the 
hunt. Even as she continued to tower over the cubicles she realized it was too much space to 
search. She took to kicking down the wall in front of her. With just a brief motion of her foot did 
she managed to not only push the cubicle wall but launch it. Three desks were destroyed in one 
sweep, and it was then that she heard a pained yelp. </p>
<p>Cora bounded over to the mess from which she’d heard the voice. She felt her growth coming to 
a close just as her head came within a few inches of the fourteen-foot ceiling. With one hand she 
cleared the debris away, revealing a cowering crook. No time was wasted in throwing him across 
the office; he flew for dozens of feet until hitting something. The gigantic huntress paid no mind 
for his destination once he’d been tossed. </p>
<p>By some miracle Cora’s clothing had managed to contain her after her most recent growth. The 
building didn’t change, either; she paid no mind to these facts beyond brief recognition. She 
came bounding back out of the call center in time to see four crooks rushing into the restrooms. 
Both pairs seemed to struggle with the doors’ immense size but only briefly. </p>
<p>“So, what I’m saying is that I don’t care what happens in the world, or what changes come,” 
Vanessa spoke through the intercom, “I can handle it, I know that I can.” </p>
<p>Cora chose to enter the men’s bathroom first, flinging the door off its hinges with one hand. The 
men’s room was clearly not built to accommodate her as its ceiling was only teen feet high. She 
ducked in, having to crawl on her hands and knees in order to fit inside. </p>
<p>“But I know I can’t handle a world without you in it, Cora, and I know I have the power to 
prevent that,” Vanessa’s voice was resolute. </p>
<p>“Please come back to me, shorty,” Vanessa commanded in a domineering tone. </p>
<p>Cora’s heart fluttered at the sound of her girlfriend’s demand. The flutter increased in intensity 
until it felt like her entire body was pulsing. While the restroom itself was wide she remained on 
her hands and knees, crawling across it in search of her prey. Her body was visibly pulsing, even 
to the point of causing the ground to quake somewhat as she crawled. She seemed to be 
stretching her legs, reaching her arms and flexing her back. </p>
<p>Yet, Cora was merely crawling through the increasingly inadequate space. Her body expanded 
outward with forceful spurts. Along with the rhythm of her beating heart did she become more, 
and more, and more. Her ass pushed out until her shorts finally burst at the seams, revealing a 
derriere that jiggled with every step. She felt her shoulders brush against the ceiling, so she bent 
her arms to remain small enough to fit inside the room. </p>
<p>A loop of shoulders scraping ceiling tiles and Cora bending lower and lower occurred. When she 
was pushing tits the size of full-size sedans into the floor she decided to stop playing around. She 
flexed her arms and shoulders until her bountiful breasts bulged around every orifice of the 
garment. The amount of boob on display above, below and to the sides of the bra dwarfed any 
other living human alone. </p>
<p>When Cora sat up her back and head utterly destroyed the ceiling above. She flexed again as she 
felt another pulse pour into breasts. The sports bra finally tore off and she waited expectantly for 
clothing to reappear on her body. None did, signaling the collective surrender of the world’s 
tailors to try to contain her incredible body. She huffed angrily and grabbed hold of a counter 
that was host to a set of ten sinks. Then, she swung the object into every stall she could until it 
was destroyed. </p>
<p>There was a sickening crack followed by a pair of voices crying out in pain. With two fingers, 
she reached into the rubble to confirm the presence of two motionless masked figures. As Cora 
took her leave, the bathroom did not reshape itself. The entryway was utterly destroyed when she </p>
<p>forced her shoulders through it. On the other side she was pleased to find out she could stand up 
to her full height. </p>
<p>It appeared the women’s restroom was significantly larger than men’s, or at least the door was. 
Standing still, she was taller than a double decker bus. If she went up on the tips of her toes, she 
could hug the roof of a two-story house. With her stature she could also likely destroy it with her 
car-sized breasts, or smash it with her equally-large ass. A sigh of satisfaction escaped her lips at 
the sight of her gratuitous proportions. </p>
<p>Just as Cora pushed open the door to the bathroom did she hear the intercom emit a feedback 
signal. She stopped briefly in anticipation of Vanessa’s next message. </p>
<p>“Oh, looks like somebody’s at the door. Hey, tiny, can you wrap it up already? I’m in the 
security room, first floor, door’s labelled,” Vanessa was trying and failing to hide the fear in her 
voice. Fear-fueled rage ignite within Cora with a renewed intensity. She pushed the restroom 
door open, shattering its hinges as well. Her form rapidly began to lengthen once more. She 
began smashing one stall door after another until she found the first crook. He was picked up by 
a hand as large as he was and used as a battering ram until he was knocked unconscious. </p>
<p>Still, Cora continued using the assailant to bash open doors until she found the second. With one 
gripped in her hand, she kicked at the man’s chest. Then, she threw the other at him for good 
measure. Neither seemed to be moving. Immediately, she turned on an enlarging heel and made a 
mad dash toward the security room. At such a high speed her body was sent into a fit of 
bouncing and jiggling. </p>
<p>Each step created the illusion that Cora was walking up a flight of stairs. One step pushed her 
head high and she remained at that height. Her bust would bounce upward and come back down 
an inch or two larger. Her frame increased once more to keep her proportionate, but still utterly 
gargantuan from every angle. By the time she reached the security room the majority of Earth’s 
population would stand no higher than her knees. </p>
<p>The sight that greeted Cora sent terror through her spine. The last gunman, the one that had been 
sent away, was holding a pistol to Vanessa’s head with one hand. With his other he was 
squeezing her bust. For a brief moment the giantess regarded her girlfriend, having seen her for 
the first time that day. Something about her seemed larger, fuller; and was she taller? Cora 
couldn’t adequately focus on ogling Vanessa. </p>
<p>“You breathe wrong and this bitch is dead!” the gunman screamed. </p>
<p>Cora’s mind raced; she looked for anything in the room that could help. Even at her size she felt 
that distant feeling of powerlessness and humiliation wash over her. She made eye contact with 
Vanessa and her eyes welled up with tears. Then, while staring at the girlfriend she dwarfed by 
more than a dozen feet a plan came to her. </p>
<p>“Baby, don’t worry. It’s going to be okay,” Cora said as she raised her hands, “I’m signing 
ownership of the bank over to you.” </p>
