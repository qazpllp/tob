<p>THE SWAN </p>
<p>By HikerAngel </p>
<p>Olivia touched the wall of the pool then flipped her goggles up to look at the 
scoreboard. Second place. Again. To Isabella. </p>
<p>Fuck. </p>
<p>Olivia had trained as hard as humanly possible all summer… and somehow 
Isabella had improved more than she had. And not just by a little. Isabella had 
just beaten her by half a pool length. </p>
<p>Not only that, but over the summer Isabella had gone from cute high school 
junior to practically a supermodel. That was just Olivia’s luck. In one summer, her 
rival just 
 to become insanely beautiful 
had
​
competitive swimmer. </p>
<p>Two years ago, Isabella and Olivia had actually been friends. Even last year, 
they weren’t on bad terms. Unfortunately, Isabella’s newfound beauty and ability 
seemed to have made her unbearably conceited. To make matters worse, she 
seemed to delight in rubbing Olivia’s face in her superiority. </p>
<p>Olivia climbed out of the pool, the smell of chlorine filling her nostrils, and shook 
her head in frustration. </p>
<p>“Nice kick, slowpoke. Maybe I should start calling you turtle… if you’re slow, you 
can at least go hide under something,” said Isabella, punctuating her derogatory 
words with a giggle. </p>
<p>Olivia tried to think of a comeback as Isabella walked away, but as her eyes took 
in Isabella’s gorgeous ebony hair, stunning face, full breasts, and swimsuit-clad 
athletic body, she could think of nothing negative to say. The only thoughts that 
came to mind were gushing words about how amazing the wicked girl looked, 
and that wouldn’t do at all. </p>
<p>an unbeatable Olympic-level, 
and
​</p>
<p>​
​
 
“Come on, girls,” Isabella said to the three other girls on the swim team that had 
become her hopeless sycophants since the start of the school year. Olivia 
refused to treat the girl as the queen of the school, regardless of how attractive… 
and strong… and fast… and smart… and, well, everything, she was. </p>
<p>Isabella whirled and strutted off to the women’s locker room, her latest athletic 
and verbal humiliation of Olivia complete. Olivia’s shoulders slumped, and she 
made her own way to the locker room, toweling off as she went. </p>
<p>In the locker room, Olivia was “treated” to a more intimate view of her rival’s 
unmatchable body as she slipped off her swimsuit and reached for her street 
clothes. Isabella’s legs with long, toned, and lean. They were the sculpted legs of 
a ballerina. The amazing girl’s hips were full and rounded. Her abs were svelte 
and defined; her butt, firm and perfectly-formed; arms slender but sculpted. </p>
<p>Her breasts, however, were the crown jewel of Isabella’s stunning body. They 
were sublime. The voluptuous spheres had been the talk of the school last week 
when classes had begun. The consensus opinion among Olivia’s classmates 
was that they were two full cup sizes larger than the Bs she had sported before 
summer. Add to that a face that could grace a magazine cover, and it was 
enough to make Olivia question the concept of karma. After all, the girl had done 
nothing but ostracize Olivia with all of her magnificent gifts, using them to belittle 
her. </p>
<p>Isabella noticed Olivia staring. </p>
<p>“Like what you see, lesbitch?” Isabella said with a satisfied smirk. </p>
<p>“I, um…” Olivia stuttered, feeling a flush rising up her cheeks. </p>
<p>Isabella made a show of pulling clothes over her sexy body, while Olivia, shamed 
by the other girl’s comment, attempted to hide from view behind a locker door. </p>
<p>Once dressed, Isabella walked by Olivia as she exited the locker room, 
sycophants in tow, catching her with a shoulder as she passed. The blow spun </p>
<p>Olivia around and sent her to the ground on her ass. She heard a giggle from the 
cluster of girls as they left. </p>
<p>Olivia rose, pulled the straps of her bra over her shoulders, then walked over to 
the mirror as her eyes became glassy from the degradation. She wasn’t a bad 
looking girl, with a fit, athletic build and a pretty face. It’s just that Isabella was… 
so much more. </p>
<p>Olivia wiped the tears from her eyes and finished dressing before walking out of 
the girls’ locker room, lost in thoughts of envy toward her superior peer. Staring 
at the hallway floor as she adjusted her backpack, she walked right into 
someone, bounced off, and fell on her ass for the second time in the last few 
minutes. As she looked up, she saw a hand reach out to her. </p>
<p>“Whoa, sorry about that! I think that both of us were a little distracted there. I 
have this bad habit of texting while I walk down the hall.” </p>
<p>It was Andrew Maxwell, the school’s quarterback and god among boys at school. 
A sheepish grin on his strong-jawed, deliciously handsome face, he offered his 
hand to help her up. Olivia reached upward, taking his hand. He pulled her up, 
and she could feel his strength with the motion. She licked her lips as she 
watched the muscles in his arms pop with the effort. </p>
<p>“Are you alright, Olivia?” He asked, a twinkle lighting his dark eyes. </p>
<p>“Yes, yes, fine,” said Olivia, embarrassed. That seemed to be a perpetual state 
for her these days. </p>
<p>“I was wondering… are you going to the homecoming dance tonight?” He asked. </p>
<p>Olivia’s jaw dropped. Was the cutest guy in school about to ask her out? </p>
<p>“I, well… no one’s asked me, so…” </p>
<p>“What if someone did? What if I did? What would you say?” He asked with a 
brilliant smile. </p>
<p>“I, um, would probably say, ‘heck yeah!’” Olivia said, giving him a smile of her 
own. </p>
<p>“Great! Then it’s a date!” He said. He gave her a wink and walked away. </p>
<p>Holy shit! 
Olivia thought. 
​
things were looking up for her, after all. </p>
<p>Maybe 
I’ve got a date with the hottest guy in school!
​</p>
<hr />
<p>If she is, please let </p>
<p>Olivia thought. 
Please let her not be at this dance, 
​</p>
<p>Olivia put in her nicest earrings as she examined herself in the mirror. Her new 
mascara really brought out the blue in her eyes. Her form-fitting red dress looked 
good on her, showing a bit of her B-cup cleavage, slim stomach, and toned legs. 
She gave the mirror a nervous smile as she hoped that Andrew would be wowed. 
She 
 look good, she thought. Then her thoughts turned to Isabella and

darkened. 
her just leave me—and Andrew—alone for once. </p>
<p>She walked into the dance and scanned the room, eyes coming to a rest on 
Andrew’s tall, athletic form. He flashed her a smile then began to walk over to 
her. As he opened his mouth to greet her, a dramatically curved profile 
intercepted him. </p>
<p>“Hi, Andrew. I was thinking that I might actually give you the opportunity to dance 
with me.” </p>
<p>“Actually, I’m with Olivia tonight,” he said, but he couldn’t help licking his lips as 
his eyes dropped to her large breasts. </p>
<p>“You mean lesbitch over there?” Isabella said, feigning shock. “Um, I think she’s 
into girls, unfortunately, Andrew. I caught her checking me out, just this morning. 
I can’t really blame her, though. These sexy curves of mine are enough to make 
any girl want me.” </p>
<p>​
​
​
​
Isabella thrust out her chest, nearly causing Andrew’s eyes to pop out of his 
head. She wrapped her slender, toned arms around him and guided him toward 
the dance floor, pressing her hips into his as she began to undulate to the rhythm 
of the song. </p>
<p>Andrew began to turn his head toward Olivia, but Isabella placed her slender 
fingers on the side of his head and turned it back to her, pressing her lips into his. 
As Olivia looked on in horror, he melted into her kiss. </p>
<p>Tears welled in Olivia’s eyes, and she ran out of the gym, pausing to grab her 
bag on the chair by the entrance. She ran all the way home, slammed her door, 
and flopped on her bed, sobbing. </p>
<p>She had landed a date with the hottest guy in school… and Isabella had taken 
him from her with ease. How she wanted to teach that evil bitch a lesson! But 
how? Isabella was better than her in every possible way! </p>
<p>As her sobs began to subside a few moments later, Olivia opened her damp 
eyes. Ear to the bed, she found herself staring at the bag she had taken from the 
gym, next to her on the bed. The bag was similar to her own, but it wasn’t hers. 
Curiosity momentarily replacing despair, she pushed herself up from the covers 
and pulled the bag toward her. </p>
<p>Olivia emptied the contents of the bag onto her bed. Out came a book, a wallet, a 
phone, and a bottle of pills. Overcome with a desire to find out whose bag she 
had accidentally taken in her emotional exit from the dance, Olivia opened the 
wallet to find the driver’s license inside. Her eyes widened as she saw the 
picture. It was Isabella’s! </p>
<p>A mix of feelings washing through her at the discovery, Olivia wondered if there 
was something here that she could use to get back at the other girl. Blackmail 
material, maybe? Embarrassing pictures or texts on her phone? Olivia decided to 
attempt to get into Isabella’s phone. She tried a couple of pin codes to unlock the 
phone, but they didn’t work. </p>
<p>that could seriously embarrass the cruel bitch! 
here
​</p>
<p>She turned her attention to the pills. There was no label on the bottle. What were 
they? Drugs? </p>
<p>Olivia decided to see what was in the book. She flipped it over to reveal a cover 
that read “Diary.” An evil smile formed on Olivia’s lips. Maybe there was 
something in </p>
<p>She eagerly flipped the book open. There didn’t appear to be daily entries, but 
there were three or four pages covering the events of the past summer. She read 
them voraciously, then rolled onto her back to stare at the ceiling, thoughts 
whirling like a tornado. </p>
<p>Isabella had found a bottle of pills in her father’s briefcase. Thinking they were 
her father’s medication, she had stolen them for an easy, harmless high. Later, 
Isabella had discovered that her father, a chemist for a company that had just 
filed Chapter 7 in June, had brought them home when he was laid off, rather than 
leave them at work. </p>
<p>While she hadn’t been able to use them for a temporary high, she had benefited 
had grown taller, stronger, and more beautiful over the weeks that </p>
<p>far more. She
​
followed. Isabella had called it an enhanced puberty in her diary. Whatever its 
effects should be called, it seemed that these pills were what had made Isabella 
the gorgeous, hyper-gifted athlete she had become over the summer. </p>
<p>Without giving it any further thought, Olivia grabbed the bottle, fished out a pill, 
and swallowed it. Maybe this would let her catch up to her rival. She thought 
about taking more but decided against it. What if she overdosed and it killed her 
or turned her green or something? She shivered. No, one pill would do. 
Becoming a supermodel Olympian sounded good enough to her! </p>
<hr />
<p>The next day in the locker room before swim practice, changing out of her 
clothes, Olivia noticed a line of definition running down the middle of her 
abdomen. Her breasts looked just a touch larger, her muscles slightly more </p>
<p>​
​
defined. A look of satisfaction crossed her features. It was working! The pills 
were affecting her just as they had Isabella. She was beginning to catch up! </p>
<p>As she snapped the straps of her swimsuit over her shoulders, she felt a strong 
shove from behind that slammed her into the lockers. As she regained her 
balance, she turned, rubbing her bruised cheek. Isabella stood there, tapping her 
foot. </p>
<p>“So lesbitch, where’s my bag?” Isabella said, shoving Olivia’s own bag into her 
and knocking her back into the bank of lockers once more. </p>
<p>“It’s here,” Olivia said, reaching into her locker and pulling out the girl’s bag. 
Isabella pulled out the bottle of pills, a relieved look on her face. Olivia was glad 
she had thought to replace the pills with similar-looking multivitamins, so that 
Isabella wouldn’t suspect that she had stolen them. </p>
<p>The girls walked out to the pool area for practice, their coach reminding them not 
to go out to fast on the 500-yard freestyle that they were swimming first. Coach 
clapped, and the girls dove into the water. Olivia managed to keep within a body 
length of Isabella for the first half of the race. She managed to get a glimpse of 
Isabella’s face as she came back from her flip turn at 450 yards. The girl looked 
angry at the lack of distance between them and poured on more speed. She 
began to pull away, winning by a quarter length of the pool in the end. Still, that 
was only half the gap between them yesterday. Olivia was definitely catching up 
with the help of the experimental pill. </p>
<p>As the girls climbed out of the pool, Isabella glanced toward their coach to ensure 
that she wasn’t looking, then gave Olivia a forceful shove. Olivia went down hard, 
her head cracking against the slippery, brushed concrete surface. Stars erupting 
into her vision, Olivia reached to the back of her head then examined her fingers. 
They were red with blood. </p>
<p>“You really need to be more careful, lesbitch! These floors are slippery when 
wet…” Isabella told her condescendingly with a sneer. She flipped her hair and 
headed back to the locker room, giggling with her obsequious friends. Their 
coach looked toward the downed girl, giving a gasp of concern. She ran over to </p>
<p>Olivia and helped her up. Olivia glared at Isabella, as brunette sauntered, talking 
and laughing with her friends, to the locker room. </p>
<p>When Olivia returned to the locker room from coach’s office with an ice pack 
pressed to the back of her head, the other girls were gone. Olivia fumed at 
Isabella’s latest stunt. She felt the pain of her bruised cheek and bloody head as 
she opened her locker. The sound of Isabella’s mocking laughter echoed through 
her mind. She pulled out the ziplock bag where she had stored the rest of the 
pills. </p>
<p>Olivia stared at the bag for a moment, her face contorted in anger. She 
considered. She knew that taking more pills could kill her.  </p>
<p>Fuck it!
 she thought. She poured the pills and downed them all. Every. Single. 
​
One. She didn’t care whether the pills killed her or whether they made her even 
stronger and more beautiful—she just wanted Isabella’s torture to stop! </p>
<p>A tingle rolled through Olivia’s body, followed by an almost orgasmic pleasure 
exploding within her. She closed her eyes and basked in the feeling, body 
quivering. </p>
<p>Eventually, the feeling faded, the absolute rapture giving way to a feeling of 
well-being and health. She felt amazing—significantly better, even, than she had 
the morning. Relief washed through her. If she were going to die, at least it hadn’t 
happened right away. And the way she was feeling, she seriously doubted that 
was going to happen at all. Her head wasn’t hurting any more, so she removed 
the icepack. She touched the back of her head and examined her fingers. No 
blood. </p>
<p>Olivia stripped out of her swimsuit and walked around the bank of lockers to the 
mirror. She gasped as her eyes drank in her new form. </p>
<p>Olivia’s legs looked longer, seemingly having added several inches of height to 
her previous 5’4”. Their length, however, was the least of their changes. Their 
shapely, firm, muscled length was easily a match for Isabella’s. As her eyes rose, 
they traced hips that flared into supple, toned flesh before narrowing to a toned </p>
<p>stomach. She twisted to get a look at her tush and smiled. It was beautiful, 
muscled, and perfectly formed. She gave it a slap, then slid her slender fingers 
down its elegantly arcing slope. Tearing her eyes away from her luscious ass, 
Olivia clenched down with her abs, watching them pop into carved relief with the 
effort. The corners of her open mouth began to curl upward into a smile as her 
gaze moved upward to her breasts. High and firm, they had gained a couple of 
cup sizes to match the mouth-watering pair that Isabella was so proud of. </p>
<p>Olivia’s lips had plumped, and her cheekbones had risen and become more 
pronounced, the bruise no longer present. Her eyes seemed larger and brighter, 
crystalline blue. Her brows were high, thin, and arching. As her gaze shifted to 
her hair, she realized that she was having the best hair day of her life, despite 
spending the morning in the chlorinated pool. Though still wet, her hair was 
obviously far more vibrant and thick. She ran her fingers through the shimmering 
mass, and her smile widened. </p>
<p>Excited, Olivia bounced over to her locker and dressed for school. Her panties 
stretched to their limit as she pulled them over voluptuous hips, but they were a 
bit loose over her tiny waist. She eyed her bra, then threw it back into her bag. 
There was no way that was going to fit any more. </p>
<p>The stitching of her denim jeans creaked as she pulled them up her luscious 
form. She noticed their hems rising to her lower calf. She pulled her t-shirt over 
significantly larger breasts, her nipples clearly visible through the cotton without 
her bra. She began to feel embarrassment color her cheeks, but forced it down. 
She didn’t have anything to be ashamed of. She had no choice, and it’s not like 
her body wasn’t pleasing to the eye. Hell, she wouldn’t have trouble finding a 
date to the next dance looking like this! </p>
<p>Olivia watched male eyes follow her through the hall, as her dynamic figure drew 
them like moths to flame. She smiled, knowing, for the first time, how Isabella 
must have felt these past months. </p>
<p>Olivia caught sight of Isabella. As she strode confidently by, Isabella’s eyes 
widened before narrowing in suspicion. Olivia saw Isabella’s hand reach inside </p>
<p>her bag. The nasty girl was probably checking to make sure that she still had the 
pills. </p>
<p>As Olivia flipped her hair, passing her rival, she saw a white tablet between 
Isabella’s fingers and smirked. 
going to do much for you, bitch! </p>
<p>, Olivia thought. 
Good luck
​</p>
<p>Those vitamins aren’t </p>
<hr />
<p>When she got home that day, her jeans were becoming painfully tight around the 
hips. As the peeled them off, she noticed long tears down the side of her thighs. 
She was definitely going to need some new clothes! </p>
<p>She pulled off her t-shirt with a difficulty that belied her new strength. 
It’s just that 
 she thought as she wriggled the

​
fabric over their unyielding swells. </p>
<p>She admired her gorgeous figure, significantly more beautiful now than it had 
been even this morning, before throwing on her stretchiest sweats and most 
oversized t-shirt for bed. Olivia was exhausted, possibly as a result of the 
massive changes her body was undergoing. Whatever the reason, as soon as 
her head hit the pillow, she was out. </p>
<p>In the morning, however, she awoke feeling more energized than she ever had in 
her life! She bounded from the bed, flinging off her pajamas to get a good look in 
the mirror. She looked far sexier, if that were possible, and much more fit. If the 
world’s most gorgeous model worked out for a full year to become a fitness 
model, she might begin to approach the jaw-dropping shape of Olivia’s new self.  </p>
<p>Her luminous azure eyes smoldered with sensuality as they returned her intense 
gaze. Her face was magnificent—youthful yet refined. She pursed her pillowy 
lips, their rose color apparently natural now, not the result of lipstick. </p>
<p>She couldn’t maintain the sexy pout with her lips, however, as her eyes dropped 
to her prodigious breasts, which despite their size, seemed to defy gravity, high 
and proud on her chest. Her lips broke into a beatific smile. </p>
<p>​
​
​
 
Traveling downward, her abs were now carved as if in steel, even relaxed. Her 
legs were endless, silky, and insanely toned. As she twisted to see her ass in the 
reflection, she watched as a symphony of striation popped into relief in her legs. 
The defined musculature faded into smoothness as her motion stopped. The 
spectacular, spherical curve of her perky ass completed her hourglass shape, 
her full breasts and butt punctuating her sinuously slender torso. She couldn’t 
help but ogle the perfection of her own ass, its dynamic, curvaceous lines beyond 
compare. She gave it a light slap, and it didn’t jiggle in the slightest.  </p>
<p>As she twisted back, lowering her heels back to the ground, sheets of her 
luxurious platinum-blond hair shifted, cascading over her shoulders like a 
shimmering waterfall. </p>
<p>She felt like a goddess. </p>
<p>As energized by her new appearance as by the feeling of power that coursed 
through her veins, Olivia walked over to her closet to see what might fit this 
breathtaking new body of hers. She pressed a slender finger to her plush lips and 
considered, finally taking a tight but stretchy crimson dress off the hanger and 
tossing it onto her duffel bag to put on for school after swim practice. She put a 
pair of red flats in the shoe compartment of the bag—it’s not like she needed 
heels to make these legs look good! </p>
<p>She grabbed her favorite earrings and shoved one of them into her earlobe. 
Unfortunately, she missed the hole, and the post of the earring crumpled against 
her skin. Weird! Oh well, she didn’t have time to mess with them, so she would 
just go without earrings today, despite the fact that she was wearing a dress. </p>
<p>She put her sweats and baggy t-shirt back on, then pulled her mass of hair into a 
ponytail. She grabbed the doorknob and heard an odd crumpling sound. She 
looked down and saw a finger and thumb sized dent in the knob. Oops! 
Apparently, her strength was a bit beyond Olympic level now! She trembled with 
anticipation for swim practice. She couldn’t wait to put Isabella in her place. </p>
<p>She arrived to practice late, and the locker room was empty as she pulled her 
swimsuit over the hills and valleys of her breathtaking form. Glancing at the 
mirror, she noticed that it was so tight and her body so hyper-fit, that the suit 
gripped her feminine muscle. She looked at her abs and noticed that the clingy 
suit showed every sculpted nook and cranny of her unbelievably toned, nubile 
body. </p>
<p>She gave the mirror a dazzling smile, then jogged out to the pool. Coach had just 
clapped to start the 500-yard competitive swim to open practice. By the time 
Olivia reached the edge of her lane to start, Isabella had a half-length lead. Olivia 
gave a dark smile then dove into the water and felt the power in her legs as she 
kicked to rise back to the surface. Breaking the water for a breath, she slipped 
her arm into the water before her and pulled with unbelievable force, lurching 
forward in the water. After a few strokes, she was accustomed to her new 
strength, powering through the water with ridiculous speed like a human torpedo. 
As she touched the wall on the final lap, she watched Isabella in a kick turn. She 
looked at coach, who was holding up four fingers. Isabella had just completed 
her eighth lap in the time that it had taken Olivia to finish all twenty! </p>
<p>Olivia kicked hard with her legs and launched herself clear out of the pool without 
even touching the edge, landing, knees bent, at the edge of the pool. Her coach, 
so amazed by the fact that she had crushed the rest of the team by twelve 
lengths of the pool, didn’t seem to notice the fact that Olivia had just jumped out 
of the pool with the power of her legs, like a dolphin. </p>
<p>“Olivia! That was beyond amazing!! I’ve never seen anyone swim so fast! You 
would give Michael Phelps a run for his money!” </p>
<p>Olivia was fairly certain that she would have lapped Michael Phelps a half dozen 
times with the time flashing on the stopwatch, but her coach was so excited 
already that she decided not to say anything. </p>
<p>Olivia sat down at the edge of the pool, kicking her legs idly in the water to wait 
for the other girls to finish. When Isabella touched the wall on her final lap, Olivia 
gave an exaggerated yawn. </p>
<p>“It’s about time, Isabella. You’re getting slow! Must be all that body fat you’re 
putting on…” </p>
<p>Isabella looked furious but glanced downward to her own body on hearing 
Olivia’s body fat comment. As her chin rose up again, her eyes came to rest on 
the cobbled perfection of Olivia’s midsection, which displayed a level of fitness 
far beyond that of Isabella.  </p>
<p>Isabella, gulped, and, not knowing what else to say, huffed, “You cheated!” </p>
<p>Olivia simply smiled as her rival pulled herself out of the pool. As Isabella walked 
behind her, she launched a kick at Olivia, intending to knock her off the edge and 
into the water. Olivia, however, saw the leg coming. Hands flashing out with 
lightning speed, she grabbed Isabella’s leg and pulled her off balance toward the 
water. </p>
<p>Isabella gave a shriek of surprise as she crashed into the water, becoming 
tangled in a lane marker. The rest of the girls, led by Olivia, began to snicker as 
Isabella struggled for several minutes to pull free of the twisted marker that 
surrounded her and climb back out of the pool. </p>
<p>Isabella turned bright red and stalked toward the locker room in a rage. Olivia, 
not wanting to miss an opportunity to put the bitch in her place, followed close 
behind. </p>
<p>As Isabella rinsed in the shower, Olivia slowly stripped off her swimsuit. Isabella’s 
eyes widened as they latched onto the mesmerizing perfection of Olivia’s 
awesome body. Olivia smirked then echoed Isabella’s own words from earlier in 
the week. </p>
<p>“Like what you see, lesbitch?” </p>
<p>Olivia winked, then walked over to the shower, driving her shoulder into Isabella’s 
and sending the haughty girl skittering across the floor on her shapely ass. </p>
<p>“Oops! Sorry, Isabella, I guess you need to watch where you stand. I wouldn’t 
want you to get hurt!” Olivia gave her an evil grin. Isabella, for the first time in a 
long time, looked cowed. </p>
<p>Olivia and Isabella finished rinsing off and toweled dry. Isabella snuck another 
glance at her rival’s provocative shape as she shimmied the dress up her 
dynamic curves. In her vivid dress, Olivia looked as though she belonged at a 
fashion shoot, not at school. Even without makeup, her skin looked flawless, 
radiating vibrant health with its golden tan. </p>
<p>Olivia gave the fuming Isabella a long-lashed wink as she sauntered out of the 
locker room to class. </p>
<p>As the two girls sat in their usual seats for math class, Mr. Martin’s eyes, usually 
glued to Isabella during class, found Olivia the more eye-catching of the pair 
today. Olivia gave Isabella a sidelong glance, catching dark-haired girl’s 
narrowed eyes firing a look of jealous hatred her way. Olivia tried to suppress a 
smile as she decided to give Isabella even more to be jealous about. </p>
<p>During the lecture, Mr. Martin’s eyes glanced to Olivia’s succulent silhouette. As 
they did, Olivia tugged her tight dress a bit lower on her delectable cleavage and 
leaned forward, giving him a great view of the mind-boggling perfection of her 
breasts. </p>
<p>Mr. Martin, mid-sentence, froze, mind going blank, entirely preoccupied with the 
erotic sight before him. His jaw dropped, and a string of drool escaped them as 
he ogled Olivia’s irresistibly gorgeous, feminine charms. Titters from the class 
finally roused him from his trance. Crimson blossomed over his face as he 
stuttered, attempting to remember where he left off in his lecture. </p>
<p>Olivia shot a look of triumph at Isabella across the room, delighting as the other 
girl turned positively purple with rage. Olivia could have any man she wanted, 
she realized. The thought reminded her of Andrew, the boy that had abandoned 
her for Isabella at the dance, and an idea formed in her increasingly brilliant 
mind. </p>
<p>After school, Olivia tracked down Andrew at his locker, enjoying the look in his 
eyes as they drank in the perfect lines of her body. Just as she arrived before his 
stunned face, Isabella appeared, inserting herself between them. </p>
<p>“He’s mine!” she said defensively. </p>
<p>“Only because I haven’t taken him yet,” Olivia fired back with a confident smile. </p>
<p>Olivia stepped toward Isabella until their breasts touched. Olivia kept walking, her 
sculpturesque spheres pressing into the soft flesh before them, forcing the other 
girl backward until she was pressed into the cinderblock wall. Olivia stepped 
forward one more time, her spectacular chest crushing that of the other girl. 
Isabella’s face contorted in pain as her sensitive breasts felt as if they were 
collapsing and her ribs bending inward. The pressure from the steel-firm body of 
the superior girl before her seemed immense! She attempted to stare Olivia 
down. After a moment, however, her lips began to turn blue. </p>
<p>“I ca… can’t… breath!” Isabella said, finally breaking eye contact, eyes darting 
around in desperation. </p>
<p>Olivia laughed as she stepped backward, and Isabella bent forward, urgently 
filling her lungs with large gulps of air. </p>
<p>“Sorry, Isabella. I guess that your breasts just can’t compare any more. I used to 
think they looked nice… until mine grew 
 than yours.” 
better
​</p>
<p>Olivia’s eyes held hatred as they looked up to hers, still attempting to catch her 
breath.  </p>
<p>“But I guess that’s not any different than, like, every other part of my body. I don’t 
think there’s a single thing about me that isn’t far better than you now.” </p>
<p>Olivia shoved the inferior girl back into the wall as she passed, Isabella giving a 
whoomph
 as the wind was knocked out of her once more.

Olivia looked around for Andrew, but he had disappeared. No matter, she 
thought. She would just catch up with him later. </p>
<hr />
<p>As she arrived home, she dropped the shopping bags from a needed trip to the 
mall on the floor of her room, closing the door behind her. She twirled around the 
room in an impromptu dance that gave expression to her burgeoning happiness, 
so different than the despair she normally felt coming home after being bullied in 
school during the day. She felt so amazing. </p>
<p>She glimpsed her ever-improving body in the mirror. It was becoming more 
ravishing by the hour. She had begun to feel increasingly aroused over the 
course of the day, and she felt like putting this sizzling, sensual body of hers to 
use. As a result, she had bought nothing but sexy clothing, shoes, and lingerie at 
the mall. She gave her reflection a naughty smile as she thought of the guys’ 
reaction when she paraded in front of them with her unbelievable body dressed 
to the nines. </p>
<p>She pulled out the skimpy, black lingerie she had purchased and put it on before 
the mirror, delighting in the way it accented her luscious curves. She heard a 
knock on her door. She opened the door a crack and was shocked at who it was. </p>
<p>Andrew Maxwell stood there, eyes meeting hers through the sliver opening. </p>
<p>“Hi, Olivia! Can I come in?” </p>
<p>Olivia glanced down at her nearly nude form. </p>
<p>“Just a sec,” she replied, closing the door and grabbing a bathrobe. She tied it 
This was 
closed, then let Andrew inside her room, closing the door behind him. 
too perfect
, thought Olivia. 
​</p>
<p>Andrew paced to the far side of her room, seeming to gather his thoughts. As he 
did, Olivia set her phone to record video and propped it up on her dresser. </p>
<p>​
She walked up behind Andrew, and he turned, coming face-to-face with her. He 
swallowed hard. </p>
<p>“I just wanted to let you know how sorry I was about, you know… the dance,” he 
said. “It’s just that Isabella was so… beautiful, and it’s not like 
 were dating or 
we
​
anything, and…” he trailed off when he noticed Olivia reaching for the tie on her 
robe. </p>
<p>Olivia’s smile was nefarious as she slowly pulled the tie away. The knot came 
finished unraveling and the robe fell open. </p>
<p>Andrew gasped. He licked his lips as Olivia’s tantalizing flesh was exposed. He 
couldn’t take his eyes away. Olivia watched his cock rise to rigid attention, then 
flicked her eyes back to his rapt face. </p>
<p>Olivia shrugged off the robe, and it fell to the floor, leaving only the slightest bit of 
satin and lace between her completely naked body and him. She heard a soft 
moan escape Andrew’s lips and smiled. </p>
<p>Olivia reached out her hand, extending a finger. She poked her nail through the 
denim in his crotch, the rugged fabric providing virtually no resistance to her 
harder-than-steel fingernail. She dragged it upward along the zipper, tongs 
popping as her nail shredded the metal with ease. She finished by slicing the 
waistband. The moment she did, his jeans fell, piling around his ankles. </p>
<p>Olivia’s soft hands touched each side of his hips, and he shivered in anticipation, 
completely spellbound by her unexpected seduction. Olivia pressed Andrew’s 
boxers downward slowly, her soft touch erotic, his shaft almost painfully hard, 
quivering at full attention. </p>
<p>Olivia took the same finger that had just sliced the denim of his jeans, and 
touched it to the base of his cock, and Andrew gulped in both fear and desire. 
Ever-so-gently, she dragged her finger along the underside of his member. 
Andrew’s mouth opened. Nothing but a hard exhale came out. As she reached 
his tip, he exploded. </p>
<p>​
Olivia smiled, then leaned in and kissed him deeply. His cock never had an 
opportunity to soften. As her tongue entered his mouth, and her full breasts 
pressed into him, he came again, spasming over and over against her ridged 
abdomen. </p>
<p>Her eyes danced with delight. She had hoped that she would have a strong effect 
on him, but this was better than she had dared hope. She thought of her phone 
capturing the event on video and smiled as she pulled her tongue from his 
mouth. </p>
<p>“So how do I compare to Isabella?” </p>
<p>“Oh, God,” he said breathlessly. “She is nothing. You are everything…” </p>
<p>Olivia couldn’t have scripted that any better. </p>
<p>“You don’t mind that I’m recording this, do you?” </p>
<p>He was too lost in kissing Olivia’s neck to respond. </p>
<p>Olivia slithered a long leg down his, the touch of her silky skin electric against his. 
She pulled his shirt over his head as he continued to kiss her, marveling at his 
muscled chest and defined abs. </p>
<p>She reached back and unclasped her bra. She shrugged out of it, letting it fall to 
the floor. Andrew’s eyes widened as he felt her firm, flawless flesh touch his bare 
skin. His breath caught with the intense sensation. He was making out with a 
living goddess! </p>
<p>The thought, in combination with the thrilling ecstasy of her intimate touch, sent 
him over the edge again, and he gripped her, pulling her to him as he spasmed.  </p>
<p>Olivia had Andrew, her rival’s boyfriend, completely under her spell. She could do 
anything she wanted to him. He was her toy… she decided to play with him a bit 
more, slipping her panties over coltish hips and sensual ass. She pressed her </p>
<p>naked hips into his, feeling the rush of his breath into the elegant curve of her 
neck. His lips touched the hollow of her clavicle as she mounted him. </p>
<p>Andrew shuddered with another orgasm as she lowered herself onto him, her 
tight, moist, heat too much for him to stand, despite having cum twice already. 
Olivia smiled. There would be plenty more to come. She devoured his lips and 
heard him moan again with absolute ecstasy.  </p>
<p>Olivia pushed downward, undulating her hips. She felt Andrews muscles tighten 
under her hands, under her breasts. She ground him into her. Rising. Falling. Her 
head rolled back and her breathing quickened. Her hard nipples pressed into 
him, the pain they caused him, delicious. She moved faster, up, down. Faster. 
Faster. She cried out, her perfect body shuddering against him in climax as he 
exploded in bliss for a fourth time. </p>
<p>Andrew gasped for air against her firm but feminine shoulder, head lolling from 
the perpetual, euphoric pleasure that Olivia’s sexual marathon was enveloping 
him in. </p>
<p>Before they were finished, Olivia brought him to orgasm twice more, allowing him 
to drop to the floor, completely spent. </p>
<p>She walked over to her phone and stopped the video. She pressed the 
button and pulled up Isabella’s contact in her phone. She typed in: </p>
<p>“Your boyfriend seems to be a bit happier with me. I guess he likes 
more than </p>
<p>She hit </p>
<p>Olivia looked over to Andrew, unconscious on her bedroom floor and decided to 
simply leave him there for the night. She spread a blanket over him, then went to 
bed, wondering how much she would improve by morning. </p>
<p>with a dark look in her eye.

​</p>
<p>As the first rays of sunlight streamed through her window, Olivia’s eyes snapped 
open. She stared at the sun through the window, looking at its brilliance directly 
for the first time in her life. Her eyes seemed to zoom in. She could see sunspots 
erupting and fading on its surface, as if looking at it through an ultra-UV-filtered 
telescope. </p>
<p>She zoomed her vision back out and looked to the boy lying on the floor. He was 
so cute, exhausted as he was by his night with a burgeoning goddess. She rose 
effortlessly from her bed and moved gracefully to the mirror. </p>
<p>She really </p>
<p>The sleek, riveting lines of her perfect body were the consummation of femininity, 
exquisite and beyond erotic. To look at her was to desire her, to 
smiled, and the room dimmed. Her body radiated vitality, sex, and power. </p>
<p>Olivia looked at her phone and saw a texted reply from Isabella to her video. </p>
<p>“You fucking bitch!!!!” </p>
<p>Olivia smiled. Apparently Isabella still hadn’t learned her lesson. The silly girl 
should know better than to challenge a goddess. </p>
<p>Olivia stretched a new, blue sports bra over her outrageous breasts, slipped a 
scandalously short, red skater skirt over luscious hips, and pulled skin-tight, red, 
thigh-high boots up shapely, silky legs. As she leveled a burning look from her 
iridescent azure eyes, she thought to herself. She looked liked Supergirl only 
wished she could look—supremely powerful, heart-stoppingly sexy, and as hot 
as a nuclear inferno. </p>
<p>Her beauty wasn’t simply flawless, it was enchanting, all-consuming. It cast an 
erotic spell that no one could hope to resist. </p>
<p>That gave her an idea for dealing with Isabella, who apparently still—even after 
Olivia’s display of sexual dominance over her boyfriend—needed to be taught a </p>
<p>​
​
lesson. A dark smile crept over Olivia’s face, the appearance of the girl in the 
mirror now taking on the look of a vengeful deity. </p>
<hr />
<p>Olivia arrived early to the school pool for today’s swim meet to find Isabella in the 
otherwise empty locker room.  </p>
<p>she thought. 
Perfect! 
​</p>
<p>Olivia approached Isabella from behind, then tapped her on the shoulder.  </p>
<p>Isabella whirled, and she gasped, stiffening. It was Olivia! But she was amplified 
somehow, perfected into this unmatchable specimen of female magnificence. </p>
<p>“Hello, Isabella. I wanted to know if you really meant what you said in your text.” </p>
<p>“Wh… What?” said Isabella, trembling, skin prickling as she felt the aura of 
Olivia’s power wash over her. Isabella’s eyes roamed over the body of what she 
could only describe as a goddess made flesh. Her nipples hardened.  </p>
<p>“Your text. Your response to the video.” </p>
<p>Olivia pressed her body into Isabella’s, much as she had yesterday in the hall. 
This time, the feeling was different, however, more sensual. Isabella’s heard the 
thunk caused by the inward bowing of the thin metal locker behind her as her 
back pressed into it. </p>
<p>Olivia placed her hand against the locker next to Isabella’s head. The 
goddess-like girl’s slender arm tensed into steel relief, her tricep defined and 
impossibly hard. Her slender fingers sunk into the metal of the locker, which 
began to give way to their inconceivable strength, making a soft whine . </p>
<p>Isabella turned her head at the sound, making a small noise of surprise as she 
realized just how powerful this goddess version of Olivia had really become. She 
looked back toward Olivia, feeling a hint of moisture between her legs. </p>
<p>“I think you called me a ‘fucking bitch’,” Olivia said, her voice dropping, 
incandescent, ocean eyes now looming just inches from Isabella’s. They didn’t 
seem angry, but they were intense. Very intense. </p>
<p>Isabella’s heart rate quickened. </p>
<p>“I, um… I didn’t…” Isabella stuttered, finding speech nearly impossible under the 
nearing presence of Olivia’s achingly beautiful face. </p>
<p>Olivia’s perfect, succulent breasts slid against hers. The touch of their soft but 
unbelievably firm flesh felt soooo good, sending electric bursts of arousal through 
her own. Isabella’s eyes widened, pupils dilating. </p>
<p>“And I think you called me ‘lesbitch’ before that,” Olivia said, breathily, the edges 
of her lips twitching upward as she saw the effect that her heartbreakingly sexy 
form was having on Isabella. </p>
<p>The mouth-watering curves of Olivia’s hips pressed into Isabella, sending 
another shudder of arousal through the beautiful ebony-haired girl. Isabella’s 
hands slipped around Olivia’s lower back instinctively as their bodies pressed 
together. Unable to resist the opportunity, Isabella’s hands explored downward, 
gliding over the gorgeous slopes of Olivia’s divine ass. Olivia’s body was just so 
sculpted, so sensual, so… utterly perfect. Isabella’s breath caught; her heart 
fluttered. </p>
<p>“If I recall correctly, you said something about your curves being sexy enough to 
make a girl desire you,” Olivia whispered, her lips moving toward Isabella’s. Her 
long, bold, eyelashes fluttered lower. </p>
<p>Isabella watched the delicious, erotic curve of Olivia’s luscious, ruby lips as they 
moved in. She felt the silky skin of Olivia’s body slipping against hers. Isabella 
licked her lips with a soft moan, beginning to squirm. </p>
<p>“And the curves of this body are 
Olivia breathed, her voice barely audible. </p>
<p>beyond yours, wouldn’t you say?” 
light years 
​</p>
<p>​
 
Unimaginable power smoldered beneath the sleek surface of Olivia’s flawless 
flesh, igniting exhilarating sensation across the entire surface of Isabella’s skin. 
Olivia’s perfect nipples brushed Isabella’s.  </p>
<p>Unable to take it anymore, Isabella’s body tensed and clenched, her hips bucked, 
her head rocked back with a cry of incredible release as she climaxed harder 
than ever before. Her body shuddered and crashed into the statuesque 
perfection of Olivia’s until her knees buckled and she slumped to the floor. </p>
<p>Olivia gave a satisfied smirk, then walked past the other girls that had begun to 
arrive. They were staring in shock at the quivering dark-haired girl, moaning, lost 
in aftershocks, on the locker room floor. </p>
<p>Olivia strode confidently out to the pool area before the students and families that 
had gathered in the stands for the meet, turned, and gave a languid, beatific 
smile. There was a chorus of gasps as dozens of pairs of eyes found the flawless 
form of this goddess.  </p>
<p>The air seemed to shimmer around Olivia as she looked within to access her 
unbelievable power. She felt her ultra-dense muscles, crackling with impossible 
strength. She sensed the pull they were beginning to exert on the earth, the field 
of power that they were generating now sufficient to counter gravity. The 
concrete floor shook and cracked beneath her as she tapped that power and 
began to rise into the air. </p>
<p>The crowd looked at Olivia in awe as she rose into the air above the pool, a true 
goddess floating upward, eyes closed, long dark lashes fluttering in 
concentration. The audience was spellbound by the sensual, celestial being 
before them. </p>
<p>Olivia’s platinum blond hair, sumptuous and thick, began to drift in a swirl around 
her as she rose, like a white-gold halo, sparkling under the rays of the morning 
sun, streaming in from the window. </p>
<p>Olivia’s ample breasts heaved, high and proud on her chest, as she focused her 
divine body to fuel her ascension. The dramatic curve of her body plunged 
inward to an impossibly slim waist, the muscled perfection of her abs clenched 
into canyons that hinted at the unthinkable power within. Her tiny skirt fluttered 
around her ravishing, voluptuous ass. Her taut thighs tensed, their striations like 
steel cables encased within smooth, flawless, feminine flesh. </p>
<p>Olivia began to relax as she hovered over the pool, opening her eyes to look 
down on the people below. She looked at one man, mouth wide, the spark of 
amusement lighting her eyes as she watched the obvious evidence of his arousal 
pushing upward into his pants. </p>
<p>As the man looked at her, he couldn’t move, couldn’t think. He was overwhelmed 
by her presence, her staggering beauty. His mind shorted out as desire crashed 
through him like a tsunami. </p>
<p>Olivia gave him a wink of her insanely long eyelashes. </p>
<p>Her wink was too much for him. The man erupted inside his pants, unable to 
resist the seductive power of this pinnacle of feminine perfection. He spasmed 
and spasmed as Olivia turned her gaze to another, who did the same under the 
overwhelming gaze of her smoldering blue eyes. </p>
<p>Olivia turned her gaze upward and rocketed through the ceiling into the sky, 
ready to show the world its new deity—the goddess of both beauty and power. </p>
