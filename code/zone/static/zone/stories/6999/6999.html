<p>Wishes: Ad Infinitum  </p>
<p>Part Three </p>
<p>Inspired by a concept from Max Mammaries </p>
<p>Interlude – The Tipping Point </p>
<p>Morning sunlight found its way between the cracks in the curtains 
and lightly cascaded itself over Vickie’s naked torso. 
 It was not the light itself, more the sensation of her skin warming 
beneath those gentle rays, that slowly pulled her back to 
consciousness. Her dreams had been pleasant but there was 
nothing…. NOTHING, better than luxuriating in her new curves! 
 As a reflex movement the first thing she did was reach down to 
feel the new size of her breasts. She was delighted that they had 
expanded to not just rival, but eclipse, the size of her head whilst 
remaining incredibly perky! 
 Crawling out from her bed towards the mirror she did a little 
shimmy to watch as her top-heavy figure wobbled alluringly. She 
appraised herself with a smile, reaching for the wardrobe where 
her bras were waiting for their daily inspection. 
 Her routine had been the same each and every morning for some 
time now, ever since this wonderful wish had completely changed 
her world. 
 As predicted the label now put her at an M cup, with washing 
instructions on the label printed in a foreign language! 
 Her ribcage had barely grown at all over the last few weeks, the 
extra muscle pushing her up form a 32 band size to a respectable 
34, but aside from her overabundant breast flesh, now resting 
snugly in the massive cups, the increase was pure muscle. 
 Vickie realised that bras at her size must be increasingly harder 
to find, but the reality-altering powers of her wish made it so she 
always had a fitted bra ready in the morning. 
 Somewhere, somehow, her new reality had found a willing 
supplier, information she would have to hunt down eventually if 
she was going to continue living this other life. 
 Her entire wardrobe had grown alongside her to match her 
incredible bustline, and she pulled on a comfortable dress that 
covered her shoulders but left open most of her massive </p>
<p>cleavage. To be honest, looking down, she wasn’t sure if it was 
ever going to be possible to find a dress that covered them that 
didn’t swamp the rest of her like a tent. 
 On another woman tits this size would be unwieldy but for her it 
was just… Just fine. 
 She had the strength and dexterity to carry her heaving new 
appendages around with ease, although she had to admit they 
were now causing some issues. 
 Not what she had expected; standing, sitting, walking, running 
even jumping were all fine. She had seen photos of her new body 
in gym clothes and she had learnt to triple bag her boobs with 3 
sports bras to hold them down; uncomfortable but more than 
possible. 
 She’d done a tonne of reading on how busty women could 
exercise without aggravating their chest and settled on a unique 
solution. One sports bra specifically designed to encapsulate, one 
sports bra specifically designed to compress, then a third to hold 
those two together. 
 None of the guides online recommended it, they all insisted that 
one single ‘well fitted’ sports bra should do its job, but she also 
found discussion boards full of her full bosomed contemporaries 
moaning that they needed two regardless of how well fitted their 
clothes. 
 Well Vickie was not a woman to do things by half. If you were 
doing something then do it properly; so she’d settled on the magic 
rule of three! 
 She thought of it as triple bagging! 
 Uncomfortable at first, definitely overkill, but the freedom of 
control it gave her when running was worth it. She knew, 
subconsciously however, this would not work if she got much 
bigger. 
 But that was a problem for another day. 
 No, right now she only encountered issues when working in tight 
spaces. 
 The flat was now clear of anything at chest height she could 
knock over with a side swipe of swinging boobs when she turned </p>
<p>around. Tables, desks, cupboard had all been cleared out to 
ensure there were no accidents! 
 Worse her cantaloupe busting boobs meant it was difficult to sit 
at a desk and write! Bending forwards she had to take some time 
to manoeuvre her body into position at her work desk so she 
could sit and work without squishing herself between the chair 
and the table! 
 Her boobs wiggled all over the place whenever she moved, 
reminding her constantly just how massive they were, but she 
was loving each and every moment! 
 However when she checked her emails she realised very quickly 
that something had changed. She was still working for the same 
professor, still studying for a PhD whilst archiving the museum 
pieces, but… 
 They had hired an intern to do the actual sorting. 
 Somewhere along the line her responsibility had shifted. They 
had shifted her into a desk job! 
 Over several weeks the wishes had been slowly but surely 
altering every aspect of her life but this was the first time they had 
affected her work in a major way! 
 She spent the morning scanning over the last six months of her 
emails to learn just what and how much had changed. She still 
had access to the archive, still had found the Wishing Chest and 
asked for permission to buy it, but it was no longer her job to take 
each and every item out of storage and perform a manual 
inspection. Her assistant handled all that whilst sending reports 
and photographs to her for a virtual assessment! 
 His name was Dan, he was two years older than her and 
incredibly cute! 
 He was doing this as a part time to pay for his tuition after 
spending a few years as a college dropout. Keen, earnest, but 
also street smart – he’d left academia and spent a few years living 
in the real world and had some amazing stories about the things 
he’d seen. 
 He was also incredibly shy, wide eyed and absolutely, painfully, 
unmistakably in love with her tits! </p>
<p>She realised that the way she was sitting, perched on her stool 
basically using the desk as a place to rest her breasts, she was 
giving anyone who approached her an eyeful… 
 So maybe it wasn’t his fault. 
 But there were limits. 
 Dan could not take his eyes off her breasts, could not look her in 
the eyes for more than a few seconds before his gaze returned 
downwards towards her behemoths. 
 He seemed a really nice guy, he also seemed really apologetic 
for staring, but… Apparently, he couldn’t help himself. And as he 
reported directly to her 2 – 3 times a day that meant her breasts 
got perved on a lot! 
 According to her emails she’d had a guilty crush on him for a 
while and been debating with Penny about whether or not to just 
take the plunge with the guy. 
 He clearly was a boob guy, she was a well-endowed woman 
boob wise, the maths wasn’t difficult. 
 It was weird though. She felt an instant connection with this 
drooling, though perfectly pleasant, cutie but there was never an 
opportunity to break the ice. 
 At coffee break Vickie got fed up of the intrigue. She’s been 
mentally holding back on the game of ‘I know he’s got an erection 
but I mustn’t let him know I’ve noticed’. The tension had been fun 
at first but it was just unbearable…. 
 “Dan, I know my boobs are massive, they’re not causing you any 
problems are they?” 
 “What?” he gasped, staring at her in shock. 
 For the first time that day he was able to hold eye contact with 
her for a full ten seconds without glancing down once. 
 She hadn’t been sure where she was going with this but she was 
caught in the sudden adrenaline rush. Flexing her body, arching 
her back to push her boobage forwards, she grinned seductively 
at him over her piled up tits. 
 “Look, they’re just breasts. Big, awesome, juicy tits. If I’m reading 
you wrong I’m sorry but I think you’ve always been a bit obsessed </p>
<p>with them, and the fact neither of us is acknowledging that is 
causing a bit of a wedge between us.” 
 He was caught, like a deer in headlights, and she felt a rush of 
power as she saw and grabbed the opportunity without any 
shame whatsoever. 
 “You know if…If you want to get a closer look at them you just 
have to ask.” 
 “To ask?” He repeated with a slight stutter. For just a millisecond 
his masked dropped and she saw it all; hope, fear, lust, 
excitement, terror…. No, he was going to run, this wasn’t a trap, 
she was serious and she had to let him know. 
 “Dan, I’m serious. I think your kind of hot and I need to know if 
your serious or just enjoying a free eyeful.” 
 He shuddered, eyes finally flickering down before coming back 
up to hers. Men always looked. So did women. With gazongas 
this massive everyone looked until you called them out on it and 
then finally, finally, they were able to look you in the eyes. 
 “No, I’ve never… Vickie, I didn’t mean to stare. It’s just they’re 
just so…” 
 “I LIKE people staring Dan, but I also like you and I know you like 
me too. If these are causing you a problem I want to help, and I 
want you know I don’t blame you for staring. Every morning I 
stand naked before the mirror and stare at them myself, thanking 
god that I’m so blessed.” 
 “You do?” he raised an eyebrow. She felt relief as the moment of 
danger passed and a saucy smile slipped across his face. “What 
else do you do?” 
 “Wonder why I can’t find a boyfriend to share these wonders 
with,” she replied tartly, flicking a stand of hair out of her 
cleavage. “Wonder why you’ve been working with me for six 
months now and never once had the gumption to ask me on a 
date. I know your single…” 
 “You want me to ask you out?” 
 “If you want to dummy,” she laughed, standing up and stalking 
across the small room towards him. He stood to meet her, eyes </p>
<p>on hers as she reached up (and over her tits) to reach him and 
pull him towards her. 
 As their lips locked her chest bumped into his and nearly 
bounced him backwards, but she clung on to hold him steady for 
just one perfect moment. 
 Ten minutes later they were stumbling into the stationary 
cupboard, arms all over each other as they stripped clothes off. 
Vickie was kissing and licking his neck, moaning with delight as 
his hands ran up and down her body, struggling with the clasps of 
her bra to tear the monstrously large garment off. 
 She fell backwards onto the floor, pulling him down alongside 
her. Her heavy breasts slammed into her chest as she flopped 
over on her side and she gasped at the impact. 
 “What is it?” Dan asked, pausing to stare at her with concern. 
 “Just my boobs,” she laughed, “I’m fine! I forget how heavy they 
are sometimes!” 
 “I don’t see how anyone could forget how heavy these are,” Dan 
said, gliding his hands up to squeeze her left tits. Her giant orb 
dwarfed his hand, in fact he could only really cup her areola if he 
wanted to, she was that massive! 
 She gasped, amazed at how sensitive her newly huge breasts 
were as they finally got attention from a new sexual partner! This 
is what she had been waiting for all this time! 
 Things had changed and it wasn’t just her boobs, although for 
obvious reasons they were the centre of attention. The last time 
she’d slept with a guy Vickie had been a skinny freak, basically 
skin and bone, and she’d been handling men bigger and stronger 
than her. 
 Now Vickie was nearly as tall as Dan and definitely stronger, just 
comparing their arms she had far more muscle definition than the 
poor little guy. She was able to gently push and pull him around 
with ease, guiding his body where she wanted to suit her, rather 
than the other way around. 
 He didn’t seem to mind this small emasculation however, in fact 
he was enchanted by every inch of her naked body, spotting </p>
<p>kisses down her front, towards her waiting pussy before he dived 
back upwards to start again. 
 She wanted that, she NEEDED that, but first she wanted to get 
the most out of her new endowments! 
 She kissed him, tongue forcefully against his to explore his 
mouth, before guiding his head down towards her breasts, and 
she had to bite her tongue to hold back shrieks as he put his 
tongue on her breasts. He kissed and suckled, working in circles 
around her nipples, slowly edging closer and closer towards it and 
the anticipation was driving her crazy. 
 She could feel herself getting wet, and his erection pressing 
against her thigh. 
 This was going to be oral only, she decided at the last second, 
although she’d been tempted to go all the way. A blowjob today, 
to take the edge off his lust, then a proper date in a few days to 
see if he really was worth keeping around. 
 And if it didn’t work out she always had the Dream Chest to make 
a few minor improvements… </p>
<p>ACT III – Penny’s Story 
A Story Told Twice Over </p>
<p>*Day 23 </p>
<p>Penny stood in Vickie’s living room, staring down at the box that 
had caused all this trouble. 
 The flat was deserted, Vickie was out, so nobody knew she was 
here. Nobody knew she had a key but then for a woman with her 
resources it wasn’t hard to get what she wanted. 
 She held a small strip of paper in her hand and she glanced 
around nervously. What she was going to do would break her 
best friend’s one rule. 
 However it was absolutely necessary. 
 It was now nearly four weeks since the world had invisibly 
changed around them, and she was fed up not knowing. She was 
fed up discovering each and every day that things were just a 
little… Off. 
 She was fed up being caught out expecting her life to go one way 
and discovering it had gone another. 
 Most of all she was fed up of the two bustiest women in her life 
bitching about each other behind their back. There was more to 
life than big tits, not that you would know it listening to Vickie and 
Laura bitching. 
 This wasn’t right. This wasn’t how things should be. 
 However she could not recall how they were before – the only 
thing to change that she was consciously aware of was the 
reserve of extra cash that had appeared in her bank account. 
 She’d promised herself money would not change her, but had it? 
Was just becoming a multi-millionaire all it took for the world to 
treat you differently? 
 “I wish I knew what had changed,” she said aloud as she closed 
the door on the Dream Chest, although she knew it wasn’t 
necessary. 
 Her wish was deposited already and tomorrow… 
 …Tomorrow they would see what had happened. </p>
<p>Everyone felt sad for Vickie. 
 Though she never showed any outward sign of how troubled she 
was it had always bothered her that she had no…. anything. 
 She’d hooked onto friends who had every female stereotype 
going; Penny had as much curves as any woman but her 
shortened stature meant her figure (and particularly her ass) was 
as thicc as they came. Then there was Jane, the statuesque 
beauty who towered over most men. 
 But really Vickie was most jealous of Laura, ‘tit’-ania herself, a 
woman who had embraced her virginal breast hypertrophy to 
become an exhibitionist extreme. 
 Vickie practically worshipped at Laura’s feet. Whatever her 
breast developed friend said she jumped at without thinking twice. 
It was as though she craved attention from her more developed 
friends to reassure her own fragile ego. </p>
<p>Everyone felt jealous of Vickie. 
 Even Laura, secretly, was jealous that she didn’t have the most 
massive breasts in the city. Who would have believed that two 
girls paired with each other throughout college would have the 
two most developed and well reported cases of Gigantomastia for 
miles around living just a few doors down from each other? 
 And though Laura was the exhibitionist, the woman who wanted 
every pair of eyes on her magnificent tits, she was secretly very, 
very angry that Vickie had her inched out by just a narrow margin. 
 Breast envy was a terrible thing. 
 And Penny was fed up of playing go between for the two girls’ 
growing hostility. </p>
<p>*Day -2 </p>
<p>Penny glanced down at her watch. 
 They had been trying dresses on for three hours already and 
nothing had quite been right. Why, oh why, had she wanted to co-
ordinate clothing? In what mad world had she thought, for a 
moment, that this could possibly work. 
 Nothing, and nothing, that fitted her short stubby frame could 
possibly match her two friends freakish body shapes. 
 This last shop was their final chance – if they didn’t have 
anything then she’d have no choice but to give up. And whilst 
she’d slipped into the selected dress quickly enough the two 
women the other side of those cupboards would be pushing and 
pulling at various bra straps to try and look as presentable as 
possible. 
 “Are you coming out?” she asked eventually. 
 “Yes,” came twin replies from behind the curtains, before one of 
them added quickly; “I was just wondering if I need to go braless 
with this one.” 
 “That Laura,” Penny said tactfully, “Is something no one wants to 
see. At least not in public.” 
 Come out and let me inspect.” </p>
<p>Penny frowned at the red dresses she had forced her best friends 
to try on. They had all agreed to co-ordinate for the launch party 
knowing it would be a tall order. 
 Skinny, lanky and boobalicious – with her short stature the four 
musketeers had almost every female body shape extreme 
catered for. 
 If she was going to toe that difficult line of attractive but not overly 
sexual she’d need to consider how it would look on anyone. </p>
<p>And with the sole exception of Laura, whose frontage would 
stretch a circus tent to the limit, this looked like it could actually 
work. 
 “I feel like this dress would be better without a bra,” Laura said 
critically, running her fingers along the straps beneath the fabric, 
the wires taught against her flesh as they strained to hold up her 
monstrous boobage. 
 “That is not anything the world needs to see. It looks fine, those 
straps are barely visible,” Penny replied before turning to grin at 
Vickie. “How about you? How do you feel?” 
 In response Vickie gave her a little ballerina’s twirl. 
 The girl had always been light on her feet, she could almost 
double as one of Santa’s elves. 
 Oh fuck, this wasn’t going to be a Christmas themed do… </p>
<p>Penny watched as her friends stepped out to examine themselves 
in the mirror, pulling up their green dresses and smoothing down 
their plunging cleavage. 
 The busty buddies had the most outwardly feminine body shapes 
of anyone she knew – picking something conservative that would 
appear classy but not prudish was a challenge. 
 There was a tonne of cleavage on display but the dress code 
could not be accused of being immodest. With these two it was 
just a fact of life. 
 “How do you feel?” she asked, grinning as Vickie gave a little 
ballerina’s twirl. Her muscular frame powered her round in a 
circle, long arms outstretched, tits thrust out to fill the space 
before her. 
 As the girl came to a halt her top failed to stop with her; the two 
prodigious boobs jiggling against each other for freedom. 
 “Not very supported,” Vickie said laughing, patting her frontage 
down to a gentle halt. “But at least I’m not going to pop out in this 
contraption.” </p>
<p>“Stop moaning about that sports bra,” Laura rolled her eyes 
irritably “It’s all I ever hear about girl; if your boobs are weighing 
you down so much stop jogging everywhere.” 
 “No,” Vickie replied, flexing her arm at her friends, “That would 
mean letting them win.” 
 “By them do you mean gravity or the perverts following you 
everywhere with cameras?” Penny asked, and both girls giggled 
as Vickie went bright red out of embarrassment. 
 The two endowed girls turned to examine each other in the 
changing room mirrors. Their bosoms heaved as they moved and 
turned and Penny stepped back instinctively to give them room. 
 Because she was short her head was about level with those twin 
wrecking balls, and she knew from experience they carried 
enough momentum to send her staggering if she wasn’t careful. 
 Penny wondered for a moment why she’d ever though co-
ordinating dresses would be a good idea… </p>
<p>Jane grinned down at Penny and offered a small but silent 
thumbs up. 
 The giant girl had probably spotted exactly the same small issue 
their small friend had she had but decided it wasn’t a problem 
worth mentioning. 
 “I don’t feel conspicuous,” was all she said, grinning at her 
reflection in the mirror; “This will do; probably as close as we’re 
going to find that doesn’t look awful on at least one of us.” 
 “Do you think this dress needs to be strapless?” Laura asked 
again, reaching down to the folds in her top and plunging her 
hand deep into the chasm between her boobs. 
 Her hand emerged with a tube of lip gloss moments later which 
she began to apply before the changing room mirror.<br />
 “Only if you’re on the hunt,” Jane replied, reaching a hand out 
expectantly for the balm. Laura glared at her friend, who never </p>
<p>bought her own gloss, but handed it over silently when she was 
done. 
 Vickie was looking sheepishly at her own reflection; “This dress 
doesn’t leave much to the imagination; I mean it covers 
everything but I can feel it clinging to me.” 
 Jane rolled her eyes again. 
 “You’re just not used to wearing clothes that show off your 
shape,” she said, patting their skinny friend down. 
 It was amazing to see that she actually did have hips; it was hard 
to tell sometimes given he baggy clothes she normally wore. “It 
looks good on you Vickie – you should show off what you have 
more often.” 
 Vickie blushed deep red and grinned back at her friends. </p>
<p>Penny heard a buzzing noise and turned back to her hand bag to 
begin fishing out her mobile. 
 “It’s Jane,” she grinned, reading the memo. “Should I switch her 
over to video?” 
  “What?” Vickie turned in dismay, eyes wide; “Penny! No, we 
haven’t decided…” 
 “Too late.” 
 Jane’s manicured face appeared on the small screen, frowning 
as she took in the dresses Penny had picked out. The new city 
mayor paused in surprise for a moment; then grinned as he eyes 
roved up and down their bodies. 
 “That dress doesn’t leave much to the imagination Vickie,” she 
said with a smirk; “It looks good on you! You should show off what 
you have more often.” 
 “I show off just the right amount,” Vickie replied demurely. 
 “Less than Laura does even though you’ve probably got more to 
flaunt,” Jane replied, receiving a deep scowl back from Laura in 
return. 
 No one slighted Tit-ania’s boobs and got away with it. </p>
<p>Penny tensed. The size gap between Vickie and Laura was not a 
topic to broach lightly but Jane was a safe distance away on the 
other end of that phone. 
“Come on girl – you normally look like you’re on the hunt. That 
dress pulls you in nicely.” 
 Laura grinned, leaning forwards so that her boobs hung down, 
displaying more than foot of plunging cleavage for the camera. “I 
think I still could manage… It feels like I could catch a killer whale 
in here.” 
 “See,” Jane laughed. “I’m just sorry I can’t join you – but it’ll be 
brilliant Penny. It’s going to be a hit. I can tell. I’ve been telling 
everyone I know to be there…” 
 “Well, with the deputy mayor’s backing tomorrow’s sure to be a 
hit,” Penny grinned. </p>
<p>*Day 0 </p>
<p>Penny glanced up from her desk, 
staring at the accounting figures. 
 Her phone was buzzing. 
 It was Vickie, annoyed that 
she’d refused to join them for her 
little ‘surprise’, hopefully now 
apologising for acting like a cow 
just because one of her best 
friends couldn’t drop everything 
with just a few hours’ notice. 
 Well some of them had work to 
do, a business to launch in the 
morning, and not much patience 
for her friend’s hobbies. 
 Besides, the three of them had 
been out on Friday. The launch 
event of her new store had been 
a massive success, there had 
been so many people there, and 
so much alcohol. 
They had all got merrily drunk in 
the early hours, celebrating with 
champagne after most of the 
guests had gone home, and then 
spent Saturday sleeping off the 
consequences. 
 Now there was going to be a tax 
audit alongside this new launch 
and she’d fucked up massively 
by letting herself lose control on 
Friday night. She had needed 
Saturday to call her accountant 
and get him to crunch the 
numbers and she had forgot! </p>

 Besides, they’d all been out on 
Friday, done their best to have a 
good night at the launch party for 
her new store despite the epic 
disaster it had then turned out to 
be. 
 She had drunk to ignore the 
shame - and the three of them 
had ended up walking her home, 
trying to drunkenly convince her 
that everything was going to be 
okay. 
 She’d planned to spend the 
weekend working to get 
everything ready for the launch 
tomorrow. She’d fucked up 
massively by letting herself loose 
control on Friday night. Just 
because that had been a </p>
<p>It was fine – she could do what 
she needed to do. It just would 
have been better on Saturday 
rather than late Sunday evening 
when she should be preparing 
for an early night. 
 She reached for her phone </p>
<p>disaster didn’t mean tomorrow 
could afford to be. 
 It was fine. Friday had always 
meant to just be a party. Sure – 
it was meant to drum up some 
publicity, but that was it. Nothing 
that had happened there 
mattered. Tomorrow mattered. 
 She reached for her phone </p>
<p>9.10 PM 
Sorry you couldn’t come. 
I have a fantastic surprise I’ll 
share later when you are free. 
I think everything is about 
to change for the better! </p>
<p>9.10 PM 
Sorry you couldn’t come. 
I have a fantastic surprise I’ll 
share later when you are free. 
I think everything is about 
to change for the better! </p>
<p>Penny sighed. 
 Vickie could be such a drama queen sometimes. </p>
<p>*Day 13 </p>
<p>Penny woke up. 
 It was the morning after her epic pool party and the house was 
still full of people who had slept over. 
 Most she ‘sort’ of knew but dozens of people had appeared in her 
phone contacts list since she had wished for money. Were they 
actually close friends in this new reality or just money chasers 
looking for a good time? 
 Her security team (she’s discovered she was rich enough to have 
a full-time security detail? That was SO COOL!) had silently 
checked who was here and who had gone so she wasn’t worried 
about anything going missing. Who cared if they did anyway? She 
could replace this mansion three times over and still have enough 
pocket change to live her life comfortably. 
 Jane left before she had a chance to see her, but then again her 
(new apparently?) career meant she never stayed in one place 
very long at all. 
 In her memory, stretching back years, Jane had always been a 
PR woman with political ambitions, but apparently (as she’d found 
chatting to the woman last night) that wasn’t the case at all. 
 How weird must it be to wake up and find your whole career had 
shifted whilst you were sleeping, to remember your old life but find 
yourself in a new one. 
 How weird to know it was your fault, that it was because of a wish 
you had bestowed upon yourself without truly understanding what 
the outcome would be. 
 That left her with Laura and Vickie, the breast buddies as she 
privately called them in her head. Neither had anything to do that 
day so they put back on their swimsuits and lounged around in 
the pool. 
 Vickie did thirty laps (barely warming herself up) whilst Laura 
sipped gin and tonic whilst paddling in the shallows. Eventually 
Penny plonked herself down next to Laura and the two of them </p>
<p>watched their Amazonian friend zip back and forth from one end 
of the pool to another. 
 “So do you think she wished for that body because of the 
breasts?” Laura asked, glancing down at her own cleavage. For 
just a moment Penny saw a glimpse of something… nervous in 
her friend. It was there for just a moment. “She used to be just tits 
on a stick, completely rail thin if you excluded the cleavage. She 
never said anything but it must have been holding her back.” 
 “Well I don’t ‘remember’ the old Vickie,” Penny said with a long 
sigh. “To me she’s been pumped for as long as I’ve known her.” 
 It had been nearly two weeks and she was still smarting that she 
hadn’t been there in the room when the original wishes had been 
made. 
 She’d had important work to do, it had been a conscious choice 
on her behalf not to go, but then she hadn’t known what she was 
missing out on… 
 “Well she never used to be into sports,” Laura said, “Never used 
to be into anything that required her to stand up for any length of 
time. I get it, at least I have a little more heft below my boobs to 
balance them out, and I HATE sports bras with a passion… But 
she was just so skinny before.” 
 “Except up here?” Penny asked, miming two bowling balls stuck 
to her chest. Laura tipped a drink to her and nodded. “I’m 
struggling to picture her like that.” 
 “It makes me think I wasted my wish,” Laura sighed, swirling her 
gin and tonic and looking thoughtful. “Jane’s getting something 
magnificent out of her wish, the whole world is loving what she’s 
becoming, and you now have the resources to do anything you 
want.” 
 “What do you want?” Penny asked, a little surprised. 
 “I want to be the biggest,” Laura said under her breath, eyes fixed 
on the back of Vickie’s head as her friend did breaststroke to the 
end of the pool. 
 Their Amazonian friend flipped over as she kicked off wall, 
turning onto her back and did a backstroke for the next length. </p>
<p>Her boobs, flopping about on her chest, wobbled dangerously 
close to pulling free of her scandalous swimsuit. 
 “I want people to talk about me for being something special, not 
being one half of a double act. It was hard growing up with tits like 
these; men and women would stop and stare wherever we went 
and my whole family was embarrassed on my behalf. I learnt I 
was unique and special and I loved it. At least… at least until I 
met Vickie.” 
 “She must have gone through something similar?” 
 Laura shrugged. 
 “Yeah, but I’m a competitor. I love Vickie to pieces but if I could 
wish one thing away it would be her boobs.” 
 “Better not say that out loud now we know it’s possible,” Penny 
laughed. 
 Laura just gave a grunt in response. </p>
<p>*Day 14 </p>
<p>Vickie loved herself. 
 She was at a perfect size, not quite yet at that tipping point where 
she wanted to bring this experience to an end. She liked the 
change and had been out dancing in clubs to get the most out of 
her boobs. 
 And the way that eyes of men, and women, on the dancefloor 
had been drawn to her bulging chest as she danced had been 
delicious. 
 The thing about boobs, she realised, was that women who had to 
live with them all the time got bored and forgot just how awesome 
they were. 
 I mean, they were conscious of their boobs, they often had a love 
/ hate relationship with them, but familiarity breeds contempt. 
 A woman with big tits taking her top off to their partner has a 
moment of sharing their gift with a whole new person – of silently 
announcing ‘here my boobs are – now worship them’. 
 And if their partner is responsive to their needs she’ll get 
something out of the fun that follows. 
 But the joy for her is the joy their partner reciprocates from the 
discovery – they are the ones given new toys to play with. For the 
woman with the big tits this is just any other day hauling itsy and 
bitsy around. A day just like any other day. 
 But not Vickie! 
 Vickie had massive, awesome, sexy tits and they were new! And 
every day they were new again! 
 And she hadn’t found someone to share that perfect moment 
with, where both man and woman were discovering new big 
breasts and getting brand new pleasure together, but it was 
coming soon! 
 But it had to be with Mr Right, so until she found that elusive 
individual she’d just shake her booty on the dancefloor and loose 
herself to the music. 
 Right now life was good. </p>
<p>*Day 15 </p>
<p>Jane picked up the phone. 
 It rang five times before a receptionist answered. The woman 
politely took her name, asked her to wait, then told her that the 
CEO was free to take her unscheduled call. 
 She said that last part as though she was doing her a fucking 
favour letting her speak to her boss. She never said it but the 
hidden insult was there – ‘I manage this bitches diary, next time 
book ahead’. 
 Jane was used to getting her way. Perhaps the old Jane wouldn’t 
have been irritated by the momentary delay but the new Jane was 
practically livid by the time she was transferred through. 
 “Penny,” she said with delight, “This is going to sound crazy but 
can you tell me what my job is?” 
 “PR,” Penny replied quickly. “Why, has that changed?” 
 “No,” Jane replied, shaking her head, “I’ve always worked in PR, 
ever since college, but something’s different and I’m trying to put 
my finger on it.” 
 “Like what?” Penny asked. 
 “Well for one, like the fact you have a receptionist,” Jane replied 
with a long sigh. There was a long silence from the other end of 
the phone. Well…This was awkward. “Penny, I’m sorry to ask, but 
your one of the only women who knows whats going on and I 
don’t want Vickie to find out I screwed up again – if I screwed 
up… I need to know; did I do some ad work for you a few years 
ago?” 
 “Yeah,” Penny replied. 
 “What did I do?” 
 “TV commercials, posters, radio interviews… Your campaign was 
the one that really made my company take off. We went from one 
store in the city centre to a franchise after you told everyone to 
buy from us.” 
 “I told them?” Jane asked, “Penny, was I on the adverts?” 
 “You’ve always been on the adverts,” Penny replied, “You’re one 
of the most famous women in media. Your firms got the golden </p>
<p>touch; whatever your advertising goes on to sell like nobody’s 
business. How could I use anyone else?” 
 “Until two days ago I was never on an advert,” Jane replied with a 
hushed breath. “Until two days ago I did all the work behind the 
scenes getting contracts and writing content. We paid actors to do 
the actual selling.” 
 “So your saying the world has changed again?” Penny asked 
with a frown, “It had changed when we were at the party but that 
wasn’t enough? Is it still changing?” 
 “Apparently,” Jane sucked in a deep breath. “Look, thanks, but 
don’t tell Vickie. I’ll talk to her, make sure that she’d ready to stop 
this. Right now it’s all good.” 
 “How’s it all good?” Penny demanded. The woman sounded 
angry. She’d been… She’d been a bit weird about the Dream 
Chest at the party but by the end of the night it had all been 
smoothed over. Life was good. 
 But if the world was still changing and Penny was the only one 
who couldn’t see it?<br />
 Jane held bacxk from answering that question – she’d been 
about to say ‘well your successful for one thing’ but that wouldn’t 
be kind. 
 In the old reality Penny had managed one solitary store and 
she’d been good at it. Well, she made enough money to survive 
but it had never been a big hitter. 
 The woman had missed out on so much because she was 
always working day and night to make sure she had what she 
needed for payroll at the end of each month. 
 But in the new world men tended to do what Jane told them to do 
and apparently the new Jane had told everyone to buy from 
Penny’s shops. Her one store had multiplied into a franchise with 
Penny at the helm. 
 An unintentional but cool change that made everything better. 
 Jane instantly decided she couldn’t let Penny know she wasn’t 
the architect of her own success. This had to remain a secret or 
Penny’s pride would take a real knock. </p>
<p>“I’ll talk to Vickie,” Jane said, “We need to meet up again and 
discuss the Dream Chest. My diary is a bit full this week but after 
the weekend… Thanks for this, I just wanted to check.” 
 “If things are still changing aren’t you worried?” 
 “No, I think this probably changed before but I’ve only just 
noticed,” Jane lied. “Today’s my first day back behind a desk 
since this all kicked off.” 
 A new desk. A very senior desk. 
 Penny did not need to know. </p>
<p>*Day 16 </p>
<p>Penny glanced up irritably as her buzzing phone pulled her away 
from her work. 
 Vickie’s grinning avatar smiled at her from the contacts screen 
and she picked it up despite the interruption. 
 “Penny, I’ve got a question… Have you got a few minutes?” 
 “Yes?” Penny replied, recognising the worried tone in her friends 
voice. Either she was freaking out over nothing or something 
seriously screwed up was going on. 
 “I’m sorry to ask… Was Dan at the pool party the other night?” 
 “Dan?” Penny asked, “The guy you work with? The one with the 
nice ass but who can’t string more than half a dozen words 
together when you’re in the room?” 
 “Yeah,” Vickie replied. “I… I think he was there… Can you 
remember when he went to bed?” 
 Penny racked her brains, trying to recall what she could from the 
drunken haze. She knew Vickie’s latest crush had been there but 
it took her a moment to remember. 
 “You must have been more drunk than I thought. He was playing 
Spin the Bottle with us,” Penny laughed, “And I think he went to 
bed with you! Shame on you girl for forgetting…” </p>
<hr />
<p>Vickie stared at her phone in horror, letting Penny’s words slowly 
sink in. 
 Two days ago she had given Dan, a guy she’d never met before 
in her reality, but had been crushing on for six months in hers, a 
blow job and then promised him a full date in two days’ time. 
 She’d been feeling particularly horny all day – her boobs had 
reached a milestone size (larger than she’d ever originally 
planned to go) and the signs had just been… 
 Yeah, it’d been good. </p>
<p>And though she’d been wondering if she’d grown big enough she 
decided to let it go a few more days, to really push the envelope 
and enjoy being the best, as by all appearances Dan really was a 
full on boob hound. 
 Though it was tempting date she’d wanted to know if he’d still 
want her if she went beyond extreme! 
 Then that morning, the day of the date, Dan had sent her an 
ominous message. </p>
<p>Hope you’re still good to go for tonight. I’m leaving early </p>
<p>and I’ll be all set to pick you up at seven. Got to make sure we go 
somewhere special for our THIRD DATE!!!! </p>
<p>Then she’d checked her phone history and found the two of them 
had been texting ever since Penny’s pool party. 
 Apparently they had already hooked up – even though, for her, 
tonight was supposed to be their first date. For her this was meant 
to be a new discovery but apparently this new reality had already 
conquered that mountain. 
 Fuck. 
 She’d accidentally robbed herself of the first lay. 
 She’d accidentally re-written over her new reality so many times 
it was starting to get confusing. 
 She remembered playing Spin the Bottle, remembered goading 
Jane on, but in her memory she’d slept alone that night. Had she 
slept with him? Were they already an item? How was she 
supposed to ask? It wasn’t something you could bring up in 
casual conversation ‘Excuse me – have we already slept together 
or have you just licked out my pussy?’ 
 He’d think she was mad. 
 Perhaps she was crazy for letting things get this far. 
 Glancing down all Vickie could see was breasts for nearly a third 
of her lower vision. Two glorious mounds of flesh that bunched up 
on the desk before her like stacks of paperwork. 
 She was not crazy. She was doing an experiment. She was still 
in control. </p>
<p>Change was constant but it was still incremental - the moment 
things started to turn for the worse she could stop it at any 
moment. 
 And now she had proof. Absolute proof that Dan was in it for the 
boobs as much as she was. 
 If boobs were what he wanted then she would deliver and then 
some. 
 And her nearest competition, the self-proclaimed ‘Tit’ania, could 
watch as her near ‘second place’ in the breast league slipped 
from a close contender to a distance outlier. All those years of 
envy would be corrected in one go. </p>
<hr />
<p>Penny sighed as she planted her phone back on her desk. 
 Something was up with Vickie. 
 The girl wouldn’t say what it was, wouldn’t even admit anything 
was wrong at all, but she was behaving… Oddly. 
 She needed to get the four of them together again to discuss how 
their world had changed, to plan what they were going to do with 
the Dream Chest going forwards. 
 It had done so much damage already… Perhaps they should just 
lock it in an attic and enjoy their new status. 
 Or perhaps they should embrace this and go all in on their 
newfound power. 
 Either way; either they would do it as a group together or not at 
all. With Jane’s new status and Laura’s hectic job it would not be 
easy to assemble them at short notice, but she had to reach out 
and try. 
 She reached for the intercom for her secretary, and after hearing 
the confirmatory hiss asked’ “Can you get the deputy mayor’s 
office on the line and ask when she’s free for a social call? Tell 
the receptionist it is urgent.” </p>
<p>*Day 17 </p>
<p>Vickie stood in just her bra and pants marvelling herself in the 
mirror. 
 Her boobs, even in the bra lifting them up, hung down past her 
naval! They bulged out in front of her, swelling out from her 
sternum and out into the world beyond. If she looked down all she 
could see was the valley between her two twin orbs, and this dark 
shadowy cleavage between them. 
 She turned sideways to marvel at her unnatural physique in the 
mirror and grinned internally. She was far bigger than Laura now. 
For the last few days she had wondered but now it was certain. 
She was much, much, much bigger than Laura! 
 And they were heavy but her muscular re-enforced back meant 
she had no problems standing upright. She was aware of the 
weight yes but… 
 And because the world was changing with her she had no 
problems picking out comfortable bras – the ‘new’ old Vickie had 
done that for her. 
 There was even a special entry in her phone, a specialist outfitter 
who apparently supplied all her underwear custom made with 
extra re-enforcements. 
 She was several cup sizes beyond picking bras off the rack. 
 And even better she had woken up to find she was not alone in 
bed! Their ‘third’ date had been a great success and the two of 
them had stayed up well past midnight. 
 The poor, unaware fool had actually been mid coitus when it had 
happened. He’d been on top, rhythmically pounding into her when 
at the stroke of midnight she’d felt a rush of heat overtake her as 
the world shifted. 
 Her breasts, pooling up on her chest, crunched between them 
had began to swell further outwards. As she’d been on her back 
they swelled sideways, flopping up towards her face and further 
over the sides of her ribcage. Then, without a word, they had 
simply rolled over to put her on top, so her melons could hang 
free whilst she rode him like a horse. </p>
<p>He hadn’t said anything, hadn’t reacted at all, had just carried on 
kissing and gently fondling as the two of them drove each other 
towards a mutual orgasm. 
 She remembered him sucking on her nipples whilst she rode him 
in bed, how he had reached up to fondle her whilst she rocked up 
and down on top of him. All she’d had to do was lean forwards 
and let her monster tits hang free so he could play with them and 
drive her over the edge. 
 Whilst she was momentarily sated but he still wanted more she’d 
rolled over and plonked her breasts over his package, smothering 
him! 
 She’d giggled for a moment about how small it made him look but 
dared not say it aloud for offending the poor guy. They were still in 
the early days of courting – she didn’t yet know where the line 
between gentle ribbing and mockery lay. 
 How had extra boobs changed the world to make him stick 
around? Had she snagged a real breast man? Someone she 
could share these sweater puppies with who would love them just 
as much as she did? 
 Dan was now downstairs cooking for her, and whilst it was a little 
freaky not remembering the opening two days of a new 
relationship she had promised herself that she would try out new 
things. 
 And whilst, in normal circumstances, the fact that ‘he’s only into 
you because of your tits’ was a stereotype, the fact she knew it for 
100% certainty gave her this sense of power that she was 
relishing. 
 She planned to dominate this man over the next few days, to 
watch his reaction as she swelled to greater and greater sizes 
(although he would never know) and see just how much of a big 
breast fetish he really had. 
 Could she push it too far and turn him off or was his fetish for 
massive tits as great as hers? </p>
<p>*Day 18 </p>
<p>Jane went to bed exalting in her successful third day as the 
Deputy Mayor. Andrei followed behind her, a dumb grin on his 
face as he prepared to worship his mistress. 
 Three days in and she’d finally managed to sit down and have 
dinner with her boss. The things the most powerful man in the city 
had said were typically glowing. 
 He’d said he needed a woman he trusted and respected at his 
side. Said that the world needed someone sensible to hold down 
the fort. Said that he couldn’t imagine it being anyone else but 
her. 
 She’d left the PR company, fully stepped into the political arena 
and been met with nothing but rapturous applause. Standing side 
by side the mayor and deputy mayor had posed for a photoshoot 
to celebrate the new theatre opening downtown. 
 How many nights, she wondered, would that fat bastard still have 
his job? 
 All men stepped aside for Jane eventually… </p>
<p>Laura went to bed alone. 
 She’d done a fourteen-hour shift on the ward and, in her old life, 
she would have collapsed in bed fully dressed and slept through 
to the start of her next shift. 
 But she felt fine. Not tired, not stressed, not on the verge of 
collapse like her colleagues but just… okay about it all. 
 Her wish had given her a quick pickup and put her back to peak 
physical fitness, if not better, just as her work had become twice 
as demanding. 
 She wasn’t a super woman by any means she was just. Yeah, 
she was pretty good. 
 Before she slept she rubbed herself down with moisturiser, 
pushing it into her breasts carefully. Got to keep the stretch marks 
at bay for as long as possible. </p>
<p>She had a strict daily routine to look after her puppies – a routine 
to fight the inevitable sag as long as possible. 
 She may not be quite as big as Vickie, and she may not be quite 
as pert, but she couldn’t afford to let herself be shown up. 
 She had a reputation to maintain… </p>
<p>Penny went to bed angry and confused. 
 She wanted to know what had changed. She’d been fixated on it 
for three days now, ever since her conversation with Jane about 
her career. 
 Jane didn’t remember that she’d used to be on adverts before 
getting her job as the deputy mayor. Jane thought she’d had a 
desk job until her political ambitions came calling. 
 It didn’t make sense. 
 And then Vickie had forgotten about what happened at the pool 
party. Maybe it was the alcohol or maybe… Penny could 
remember it clearly, remember the way they had all played Spin 
the Bottle. 
 That was after all of the wishes had been made. That was after 
the world had changed. 
 It hadn’t stopped. 
 Something was going on and she needed to find out what. </p>
<p>Vickie went to bed with Dan. 
 He was all over her, kissing and nibbling on every inch of her 
upper body, although inevitably he kept returning to her boobs like 
some kind of perverted boomerang. 
 It didn’t matter – they were so sensitive that she would guide him 
back to them if he abandoned her for too long. But it was nice to 
know he liked her muscles as well as her fat. 
 He sat before her, heaving her right breast up towards her face, 
offering her her own nipple as though it was some kind of special 
treat. Playing along she opened her mouth and latched onto it, 
cradling her own boob whilst he tried to lift her left. </p>
<p>He needed both hands to hold it up, his fingers sinking into the 
blooming flesh as it filled to confirm to the shape of his hands. 
 The two of them sucked on an erect nipple each, each as large 
as her thumbs now they were fully erect, enjoying this shared 
moment of intimacy. 
 And afterwards Vickie dozed with just one thought on her mind. 
 Bigger… </p>
<p>*Day 19 </p>
<p>Jane wanted to meet. 
 But Vickie wanted to explore her boobs! They were swelling 
downwards more than forwards and sideways now but that was to 
be expected – if they projected out much further she’d be unable 
to pass through most doors other than sideways one boob at a 
time. 
 They definitely had their own shape and momentum now. If she 
leant forwards they hung dangerously low beneath her, and she 
could swing them back and forth like independent pendulums just 
by tensing the muscles in her rib cage! 
 Or jiggle them with her forearms… 
 Dan was going to love this when he saw her for their next date! 
 She really wanted to weigh them, to find out just how much 
weight she was carrying around. Despite her extra muscles she 
could feel it now – a pressure on her lower back and shoulders as 
the all encompassing weight bore down on her. 
 It was fine – she could cope, but…. Yeah, that was new. Perhaps 
today was the day to bring this experiment to an end. The world 
was continuing to change and perhaps she had accidentally 
passed that magical tipping point. 
 Fir example her wardrobe had a new addition she had not been 
expecting but was pleasantly surprised to see… A wheelchair! 
 She was a little surprised to see the sports photos on the wall for 
college sports teams had all changed. Rather than being the 
college netball champion she’d pioneered and led the disabled 
sports teams… 
 Well that was weird. Apparently, even with the all mighty power 
of warping reality, the Dream Chest couldn’t figure how a woman 
with breasts her size could possibly be an Olympic level athlete! 
 Well, if she couldn’t compete for the Olympics the Paralympics 
were a more than acceptable option. She perched herself inside </p>
<p>the wheelchair and gloried at how, if she leant forwards even 
slightly, her boobs nestled in her lap. 
 Well, an R cup did not make her disabled but if she let herself 
grow much further she would be heading that way…. What would 
that be like? Boobs so massive she had to use a wheelchair if she 
wanted to walk…. 
 What the hell was she thinking? In only the last month she had 
developed a love of long distance running – her new fit body had 
just demanded that she start taking jogs and getting out and 
about. She’d never seen the appeal before but now the endorphin 
rush of getting out and exploring the city was a part of her daily 
routine. 
 Except – it wasn’t any more. She could see the home gym in the 
back room, a multi-use piece of kit where she could set different 
weights in place and work out without leaving her dorm. 
 Screw that. She wanted to run and therefore she would run.<br />
 “Meet me in the park café at 5 pm” she texted her friend, before 
stripping off her regular and sliding on her two sports bras that 
constricted her boobs twice as firmly. Over the last fortnight it had 
just become the normal thing to do. 
 Before the wishes, as a naïve flat chested, non-sporty, proud 
geek she had dubiously thought the idea that busty women 
needed to double bag their boobs to play sports was a stupid 
idea. Surely it just meant their bras were badly fitted. 
 But then when she’d developed the extra flesh, the extra weight, 
and found her chest moving of its own accord with all that extra 
momentum behind it, she’d began to understand. 
 She loved her breasts but, if not supported, they started to ache 
horribly. Running, or indeed anything with a lot of upper body 
movement, exacerbated it. Compression was not just desirable 
but necessary and she’d been to shops, tried getting new bras, 
but found that no single garment had the strength to hold her girls 
in place the way she needed. </p>
<p>She’d done the maths and D cup boobs weighed around 20 
pounds, and with every passing day she’d felt it get more 
noticeable. She’d adjusted her routine to start building up her 
lower back, put the preventative measures in place to ensure she 
did no long term damage, but there was only much strength her 
body could take. 
 And the thing was they didn’t just bounce further, they bounced 
differently. She hadn’t noticed it at first but one day she had 
looked down and realised that her boobs were jiggling back and 
forth in front of her in a figure of 8! 
 Her left boob shoved her right boob, which swung out to the side 
before shoving into her left boob. Back and forth, back and forth, 
ouch, ouch, ouch. Come on girls, stop fighting and get along in 
there. 
 And so, with some trial and error, she had settled on using two 
sports bras, one designed to contain all of her boobs and then 
another to tighten the compression. 
 But now…. With boobs that reached her lap? 
 She gave herself a gentle wobble, watching as her tumultuous 
flesh jiggled worryingly free despite her undergarments, and so 
pulled out a third sports bra and squeezed herself into the 
wretched contraption. It was overkill but she needed it. Her boobs 
were sagging now, they weren’t up on her chest like perky helium 
balloons but vasty weighty sacks of water. The bras lifted her 
boobs up just as much as they pulled them in and she was glad 
for it. Then she pulled out a white tank top, pulled out her running 
shoes (which looked suspiciously clean), downed a cup of water 
and set out into the big wide world. 
 It had been a mistake. 
 She should have looked at the home-gym set up and realised her 
body was simply no longer built for high impact activities like 
fucking running. 
 Her boobs would not, could not, keep still. She thought she’d 
grown to understand jiggle and chafing over the last fortnight but </p>
<p>it turned out the way they moved when they hung below your 
chest compared to when they sat on was completely, utterly, 
terrifyingly different. 
 Side the side, up and down, in diagonal circles, the moment her 
body hit a rhythm of any sort they swung into action. If not for the 
bras it felt as though one, or both, would have forcibly detached 
itself from her body, but then when denied the opportunity it 
turned around and smacked back into her other at full speed to 
take revenge. 
 And then, worse, they weren’t just jiggling any more but they 
were bouncing. Against her stomach! Up they went, sometimes 
together but usually apart, and then they would hang in the air for 
just a blessed wonderful microsecond before slamming back 
down into her stomach. 
 If she wasn’t bruised already she soon would be. 
 She tried to slow to a jog, as she physically could not run, and 
though the smacks of flesh and flesh was less painful it did not 
feel as though it had reduced the movement of breastflesh much 
at all. 
 Her upper body seemed to have transformed itself into some kind 
of perpetual motion machine. 
 And though, just three or four days ago, she could have run to 
the park and back without breaking a sweat today she was 
struggling to put one foot in front of the other. 
 At some point her boobs had got out of sync with each other, one 
was rising whilst the other was falling. At any time one side of her 
rib cage was being pounded whilst the other had a momentary 
break whilst her cleavage jumped upwards towards her face. 
 If it hadn’t been for the sports bras she’d have a bloody nose by 
now! 
 Ignore the rising boobage bobbing up and down just beneath 
your eyeline, concentrate on the road ahead. She told herself to 
do this but it was difficult because she couldn’t just the movement 
she could feel it in every agonising detail. </p>
<p>But she had to push on. 
 How had the distance grown so much? She was less than half 
way there and every muscle in her body was screaming with pain. 
Even her legs, far enough away from her terrible boobs to escape 
their wrecking ball mentality, were struggling from the extra weight 
she was carrying. 
 Technically, she thought, if you included her boobs she had a 
horrifically high BMI. A substantial portion of her body was just fat. 
 Just fat that was trying to kill her! 
 But she couldn’t go back now. She was past halfway and it was 
nearly 5 pm. She slowed down, eventually found a method that 
minimised the pain, a sort of gentle shuffle where her shoulders 
sideways movement caused her breasts to shimmy without 
inducing the dreaded bounce. 
 This was comfortable. This she could manage. But she was 
barely jogging any faster at all than she would normally walk. She 
was going to be late… 
 And by the time she reached the park she was covered in sweat 
and panting for breath in a way she had not done since her 
original wish. 
 What had happened? Hadn’t she wished to be fitter? Apparently 
no amount of upper body strength could combat this; her entire 
body hurt; her boobs ached, the ligaments connecting them to her<br />
body were sore, and every inch of her felt smacked around. 
 “What the fuck is wrong with you?” Jane asked, glaring at her 
from a table outside the café. 
 It was a sunny day, her friend was wearing designer sunglasses 
and sipping a cocktail. She looked cool and sophisticated in a 
way that Vickie never had, and with her new boobs never would. 
 “Thought I’d go for a jog,” Vickie said, trying to shrug her 
shoulders and brush it off as no big thing. “Stretch my muscles, 
get some fresh air.” 
 “When you wished to be fitter we thought it was so you could 
actually get out of that wheelchair and walk,” Jane said </p>
<p>incredulously. “You haven’t run anywhere since you were thirteen 
years old girl. You’ve barely walked at all in the last five until this 
month.” 
 Vickie’s mouth fell open in shock. 
 She’d mis-interpreted the Dream Chest and the wheelchair 
based sports photos on her wall. 
 It all made sense now. 
 Her boobs, her monstrous, massive tits, hadn’t just added to her 
original wish they had overwritten it. Jane knew about that original 
wish but she didn’t know, still had no idea, about her second. 
 About her growing tits. 
 So in this new reality Jane and Laura assumed, and had 
probably told Penny that, Vickie had always been horrifically 
endowed. 
 That she’d grown up with a horrific case of gigantomastia which 
had robbed her of free movement from her teenage years 
onwards. 
 In this reality that had never been Vickie had either wheeled 
herself around or walked. She’d walked very, very slowly as she 
hadn’t had the upper body strength to do anything else 
 But then, just two and a half weeks ago, she had shown them the 
Dream Chest and wished for herself to be stronger. Any sane 
woman would have wished her boobs away but Vickie had just 
wanted the strength to carry her boobs around. 
 The wheelchair was pushed to one side, kept for when she had 
to push herself, but now she could stand and walk and move 
around almost unencumbered like any normal woman. 
 Not like any normal woman at all though…. 
 Fuck. 
 “I wanted to try it out,” Vickie said, grimacing in pain. “I had no 
idea it would be so far…” 
 Just a week ago she could have run that in ten minutes not 
stumbled in half dead after an hour of agony… </p>
<p>Oh god, the pain, she’d never felt anything like this before. As 
though someone had grabbed hold of each boob and pulled and 
pulled. 
 There was no single incident just the accumulated shocks of the 
last hour left her with the terrible sensation as though they had 
nearly been ripped off her torso. Every vein and ligament was 
burning. 
 “I’m getting you in a taxi back home,” Jane said, snapping out her 
phone and dialling before Vickie could stop her. “We need to get 
some ice packs on your tits before they flare up. I can see from 
your cleavage just how raw they’ve got. God knows how big you’ll 
get if they start swelling.” 
 “God knows,” Vickie replied with a sigh as she collapsed on the 
chair opposite Jane, clutching her aching boobs, and waited for 
the car to come and take her home. </p>
<p>Penny stared at her phone in disbelief after taking the long 
expected call! 
 Jane had forgot to ask Vickie about the Dream Chest! 
 Well, she hadn’t forgotten – she simply had never had a chance 
to ask because Vickie had taken a funny turn and nearly, oh so 
nearly, needed an ambulance. 
 They’d sent her because… well. Jane was the fucking mayor! 
The woman had authority and respect and Vickie had always 
listened to Jane the most. 
 But apparently the idiot girl had been running! 
 Vickie couldn’t run. The girl was a human trampoline with breasts 
that didn’t so much jiggle as wobble. 
 And so whilst Jane had been planning on grilling Vickie about her 
plans for the Dream Chest, on insisting that the four of them got 
together to consult on its future, she’d instead had to help the 
woman back into her house, lie her on the bed, strip her topless 
and apply icepacks to the girls bloated boobs. </p>
<p>And Vickie had spent the rest of the evening passing in and out 
of consciousness whilst Jane sat next to her watching trash TV 
and trying to force water down her whenever Vickie showed signs 
of stirring. 
 Jane had rang Vickie’s boyfriend to tell him what had happened 
and he’d promised to come over and look after her. She’d left at 9 
pm after the two of them had tucked Vickie up in bed.<br />
 Dan loved Vickie and he loved her big tits, he would look after 
her. Right now the two of them were probably canoodling on the 
bed, him with his hand cupped around her massive pendulous 
breast gently stroking it. Her freakishly big nipples would be 
hardening in the cool air, swelling up, waiting eagerly to be 
sucked on… 
 Penny shuddered as her mental projection went too far. 
 You saw your friend naked one time and it did terrible things to 
you. And yeah, Penny had never had a bisexual urge in her life 
until she’d met Vickie but that didn’t count. Vickie’s breasts 
weren’t sexual there were these big, monstrous, all encompassing 
‘things’ that the three of them had been laughing about for years. 
 How could Dan, fuck that how could men, be so attracted to 
things that amounted to little more than sacks of fat? 
 Wonders would never cease. 
 So, apparently, the four of them would have to wait a bit longer to 
discuss the Dream Chest and plan their future. So be it. She 
could wait… 
 Not for long though. </p>
<p>*Day 20 </p>
<p>Vickie opened her eyes, wondering what was going on. 
 “You’re up,” came a familiar voice from below her. She would 
have looked down but her duvet, mounted over her massive tits, 
pooled up in front of her and blocked her lower vision. She inched 
her body sideways, shoulders and arms aching at the strain of 
moving her heavy torso, and peered around her boobs to see Dan 
waving at her from the side of the bed. “Thank god, I was getting 
worried sleepyhead.” 
 “Why do I ache?” she asked, surprised. 
 ‘And why are you here?’ She thought to herself. She didn’t 
remember letting him in the night before. 
 “You overdid it exercising with Jane,” Dan said, fixing her with a 
pleasant grin. “Apparently you smacked yourself in the face with 
your boobs and passed out. She said there was blood 
everywhere!” 
 No she hadn’t. She’d stupidly tried to run to the park. 
 But then she’d slept. Midnight had passed. The world had re-
written itself. 
 Of course she couldn’t have run to the park. Not Vickie with the 
20 litre tits. That woman couldn’t have possibly tried to run 
because her breasts were so massive it took her two attempts to 
even climb out of bed. 
 OUCH! 
 She was sore. 
 Dan was grinning at her. 
 “It’s not funny,” she protested. 
 I never said it was, he said, unable to hide his smile. She batted 
at him with her pillow and he turned away to reach for a mug of 
tea he’d prepared for her already. 
 “Perfect excuse for you to spend the entire day in bed,” he said 
with a smile. “I’ll get you anything you want, just rest there and 
recover and I’ll do everything.” 
 “Everything?” Vickie asked. 
He just grinned back at her with a big smile. </p>
<p>*Day 23 </p>
<p>Penny hated herself. 
 She hadn’t earnt this wealth, she hadn’t worked for it. 
 Her old life had been shitty after all but she’d worked for 
everything she had. The company she’d been building up had 
come out of her blood, sweat and tears. It had been struggling but 
it had been hers. 
 Now however she was head of a multi-million pound empire and 
earning more in interest a day than she’d ever earnt in a year 
before the Dream Chest. 
 She was reaching the tipping point where she had to talk to 
Vickie and see what else they could change next. She didn’t want 
to loose the fortune but she needed something else, something 
new, some challenge to spice their life up again. 
 She needed to talk to Jane and Laura to come up with some 
ideas. To find a way to reconnect with them after their lives 
(particularly Jane’s) had changed, locking her out of their original 
friendship. 
 It sucked to know the women you loved, had loved your whole 
life as best friends, had never really existed. At least not in the 
form you thought of them as. 
 It was like being lied to…. 
 Well she was fed up of being lied to. 
 If Vickie wouldn’t take her calls she would just go over there, find 
the Dream Chest, and sort this mess out once and for all. 
 She had to know what had changed! </p>
