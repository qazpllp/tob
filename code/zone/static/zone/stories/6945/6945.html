<p>Chapter 5 
Santa Claus has Come to Town 
Word Count: 6782 </p>
<p>Happy Holidays 2020 </p>
<p>The two bustiest women Olena knew walked into a church—Janie and herself.  </p>
<p>It was an Easter Orthodox church, made of stone that had gone off-white, with towers topped by 
bowled domes and crosses that pierced up into the air. Olena had seen it as she and her family 
travelled; had attended a few services before her parents stopped putting priority on it. That was 
back when she was younger, though.  </p>
<p>Plus, the art of saints everywhere sort of creeped her out. </p>
<p>She and Janie stepped through the narthex into the main nave. Seated in the dark wood pews, 
conversing on red cushions, were what appeared to be homeless people—by the hundreds. 
They lined the walls; were all but stacked two high in the available furnishing. Many had clothes 
that didn’t fit. A few animals laid quietly nearby their owners; dogs, mostly. Pocketed here and 
there were families—or people huddled close enough to seem like families. Women stroking the 
hair of younger children, fathers throwing babies into the air to catch them again, occasional 
crying.  </p>
<p>As Janie and Olena walked down the center aisle, the people all stopped to regard them. Olena 
felt their eyes but oddly couldn’t detect their judgement. Walking among these people—she was 
tempted to think ‘normal’ people until she realized that the people on both sides of her were just 
as normal as anyone else—she couldn’t feel the heat of sexual stares or jealous arrows being 
fired her way.  </p>
<p>Here, in this church, she felt a sort of peace.  </p>
<p>Peace was stark. She was </p>
<p>They walked without interruption till Janie reached a door to a hallway where a man wearing 
patchy gloves reached out and shook her hand. His eyes glowed with gratitude at her, then he </p>
<p>used to people wanting to fuck or marry her.<br />
very

reached toward Olena and did the same, thanking her. Olena looked back as they parted; found 
him going back to his family.  </p>
<p>“One of our regulars,” Janie informed when Olena’s expression formed an obvious question.  </p>
<p>Regular at church or regular on Christmas? Both answers were likely. </p>
<p>At last they came to a vast gym-like facility. Long, portable tables were set up with plastic 
tablecloths and centerpieces that looked like wrapped presents. The ceiling was high. 
Chandeliers lit the tremendous space. It sort of reminded Olena of that scene from the first Parry 
Hotter movie—the only one she ever got to see in its entirety because her father wouldn’t spare 
her the money to go see the rest of them in theaters. “It is just same movie over and over. They 
make you pay again for same movie!” he had said. </p>
<p>Thinking about him was a bad idea. Olena felt her face heating with tears.  </p>
<p>“Olena, this is Margo. She’s one of our coordinators who helps me run events like this. As you 
can see, this is the Line of Benevolence where we distribute our dinners to those in need. 
People hang out in the church up there till there’s a place made for them, then we call them by 
group. In the back, there’s a kitchen where the bulk of this food is prepared. Then, there’s 
people behind them who have to fetch more food from trucks and truck drivers who have to go 
pick up more of it from our warehouses.” </p>
<p>Olena welcomed the newness. She shook Margo’s hand but was pulled in for a hug instead. 
Margo was a little taller, looked German, and was probably in her forties. “It’s Christmas. You 
deserve a hug, huh?” When the embrace broke, the woman looked Olena up and down. “You 
look like you’d be great on the line, but I won’t shove you anywhere you don’t wanna go. If you 
can drive a truck, by all means drive the trucks.” </p>
<p>“I-I didn’t know it would be this fast,” Olena answered. “Me helping. Is there some training I 
should get first?” </p>
<p>“It isn’t hard to smile and scoop mashed potatoes. And we trust you.” Janie gave Olena a 
reassuring look then sent someone away to fetch an apron.  </p>
<p>Once dressed for food dispensary—apron, gloves, hair net (optional but appreciated), sticker 
with a name tag placed over her right boob—Janie showed Olena the line. The ginger woman 
demonstrated proper technique with a ladle as people from the room they’d just left came 
through the line. One scoop, ask if they wanted gravy, smile, next customer. Easy.  </p>
<p>“Olena. . .” </p>
<p>Well, it had been easy.  </p>
<p>When Olena turned to the voice, she found the girl one spot down was also wearing 
see-through gloves. She’d finished shovelling green beans on one of the plastic cafeteria trays 
when she looked up and noticed Olena.  </p>
<p>It was Clarissa; the cutie from the Crafty Shack on Black Friday. She had always been a little 
frizzy like her mom, but she at least cared enough to keep her hair from turning into a bush. She 
had it restrained cutely in a hair net, pulled away from her round face. Her apron also cinched 
her waist, showing off the perky bum that Olena had remembered her for in the first place.  </p>
<p>Were those the jeans she wore on Black Friday? Couldn’t be. . . they’re even tighter on her now. </p>
<p>“Good! You have someone you know here? Then I’ll be back. I need to check on the rest of the 
staff; make sure everything is running smoothly. Keep her busy, Clarie.” Janie helped tie 
Olena’s apron without even asking. The tight single knot made her tits look so much bigger than 
they already were—which shouldn’t have been possible, but was a glorious sight to behold 
regardless. Clarissa certainly had her eyes set; shocked and amazed. They were now opposing 
twins: Clarissa rear and Olena’s breasts, both accentuated by the lacing of an apron. “Just have 
fun. You can’t go wrong. You’re doing a service to those in your community today, so try to 
focus on that.” </p>
<p>Then, Janie left and Olena was stuck in line next to her crush; one she’d abandoned and hadn’t 
contacted much since.  </p>
<p>For a dozen or so trays, they simply did as they’d been instructed: one scoop, ask if they 
wanted any more, smile. Clarissa threw in an extra bit at the tail end. “Have a Happy Holiday.” </p>
<p>Just the words on her sweet, smooth voice had Olena’s body awakening into itself. The warm 
wishes of a ‘Happy Holiday’, though, were the ones that forced Olena’s body into true reaction.  </p>
<p>Not speedy, but imminent. Olena knew she would grow if she was stuck in the line for too long.  </p>
<p>It’s not too fast. It can wait. Just maybe. . . distract her? </p>
<p>“We haven’t gotten to see each other since that night,” Olena led off, as if she were talking to 
the elderly man beyond the plexiglass. “I’m, uh, sorry for running away on you like that.” </p>
<p>“It’s fine. I came on too strong anyway,” Clarissa answered. “Way too strong. Like, stalking you 
into your staff lounge, strong. That was not okay and I’m sorry.” </p>
<p>“Nonsense. I was on the verge of fainting. I’m glad you could see there was something wrong 
and came to help me. Thank you.” </p>
<p>“Yea, you were acting a little strange. I didn’t feel right just letting you run off like that.” Clarissa 
scooped more food, wished another person the same way she had the others. “Happy 
Holidays!” </p>
<p>“Mph!” Olena tensed, feeling the movement in her giants. Still slow, she thought. And yet, her 
nerves were snappy like electricity running through a wire and every word was causing a jolt to 
run jagged tracks along her size. “A-anyway, I’m sorry for running away. I think I had an anxiety 
attack and I just needed the air.” </p>
<p>“Oh, I wasn’t worried about that,” said Clarissa in a way that sounded like she was worried 
about exactly that. “Sorry to hear about the anxiety, though. Hope it gets better—is that 
something anxiety can get? Better? Happy Holidays!” </p>
<p>“N-no— j-just gets easier to manage.” </p>
<p>“Ahh, okay. Got’cha.” </p>
<p>Their latest hiccup now taken care of, the two talked a little more casually. They went over what 
they’d wanted to discuss about each other: Clarissa’s jobs, both their families, shared interests. 
They became fast friends, easily able to connect.  </p>
<p>Once the groundwork was established, though, and the food line ebbed for a few seconds, 
Clarissa brought something more important to Olena’s attention.  </p>
<p>“When I met you, there was something about you; I don’t know what it was. Usually, it takes me 
a while to, well, kinda, start liking someone, you know? Acquaintances, friends, a lot of time 
spent just figuring out what a relationship would be like.” Clarissa pushed food around with her 
ladle. “And with you, there was a very obvious physical attraction right away—you could 
probably tell. I was pretty bad with where I was looking. But somehow, things—feelings, 
trust—they just jumped to lightspeed and right away I just knew I was meant for you.” </p>
<p>Olena looked at Clarissa; found her so cute in that moment that her heart melted.  </p>
<p>And yet, the tone of her voice had been matter-of-fact. It wasn’t meant to sound romantic at all. 
She was only describing a phenomena, one that Olena knew because she had experienced the 
same thing.  </p>
<p>“That’s been happening to me too. I’m very slow to warm up to people, but in the past few 
weeks it’s like something has opened me up. I’ve been hopelessly romantic with people in no 
time at all.” </p>
<p>“Right? It’s like something blew in with Christmas this year.” </p>
<p>“Something. . . or someone.” </p>
<p>It seemed far fetched, but could this also be Nicole’s doing? Winter made everything a little 
romantic and the holidays could make a person lonely. But had it inspired such an amount of 
love that it moved Olena and those women around her into fervent, lusty passion? Lana on the 
dance floor, Olena seducing Nicole at the hotel, the new fire with Jersey.  </p>
<p>She and Clarissa could have hooked up somewhere in the kitchen and it would have seemed 
normal.  </p>
<p>What Clarissa described had been Olena’s past few weeks. Because she was submerged by it, 
she hadn’t noticed, but falling in love and caving to lust had been easy recently.  </p>
<p>When she awakened again into the present Clarissa was closer, analyzing the vapid expression 
on her face; concerned.  </p>
<p>“I’m alright,” Olena assured. “You’re exactly right, though. I fell for you the moment I saw you.” </p>
<p>“It’s weird, right? Like, it usually takes a while to know stuff like that. I don’t think I’ve ever been 
so certain, though. I think we might be. . . Nah, I won’t go that far—. . .” </p>
<p>“Soulmates?” Olena finished the thought. It reminded her of what Nicole had said; how she was 
always good at determining who was going to be part of her life. “That isn’t the weirdest of it. I 
feel like I’ve met a few women like that, lately. Other, uh, soulmates.” </p>
<p>The line picked up, but they continued their conversation between bursts of service. Their hands 
moved fast, mouths faster. “Huh. I’ve only met you. I’ve never heard of a person having multiple 
soulmates.” </p>
<p>“I’ve never believed in them to begin with. So much this year has changed what I thought I knew 
about, well, everything.” </p>
<p>“Are you referring to. . .” Clarissa let her eyes fall to Olena’s planetary rack, the lengthy shelf of 
womanhood that earned her politely-surprised looks from the people in line in front of her.  </p>
<p>“Not very tongue-in-cheek, are they?” Olena rolled her eyes, then her shoulders. Damn, if they 
weren’t stiff. “They’ve caused all sorts of troubles.” </p>
<p>“They suit you.” </p>
<p>“How could anything this size suit anyone?” </p>
<p>“I don’t know. You just seem like the only girl I know who can pull off being beautiful with boobs 
that size. Anyone else would look like, well, plastic, I guess.” </p>
<p>It was so stupid to blush—to blush again after hearing the same line from yet another 
female—but Olena did anyway. “And what do I look like, then? If not plastic.” </p>
<p>“Hmm,” Clarissa leaned closer, bumping Olena’s hip with her own twice. “Like I could do a 
five-hundred piece puzzle on both your boobs.” </p>
<p>“I’m not that huge,” said Olena, knowing she was precisely that size if not larger. “But I’m willing 
to be proven wrong.” </p>
<p>“I’m so happy you like me. Gosh, I swore I did something to make you hate me, but this—just 
being with you like this is so great.” The admittance came out of nowhere; just came rushing out 
of the thick, frumpy girl. </p>
<p>Still, Olena couldn’t disagree. </p>
<p>“You ladies doing well out here?” Janie’s voice came from behind.  </p>
<p>As far as not being turned on for one day in her new life, no. But in other regards, “Yes,” Olena 
answered. </p>
<p>“Feel like taking a break?” </p>
<p>“I definitely can.” Clarissa tossed her ladle down to stretch out her arms and back. The curve her 
body made was every type of alluring and it hadn’t even been aimed at Olena. What was more 
intentional, though, was Clarissa’s eyes growing bigger as she goaded Olena to join her. 
“C’mon. We can have our breaks together.” </p>
<p>“But I just got here. I—. . .” </p>
<p>“To-ge-ther,” Clarissa bopped her hips against Olena’s; thrice this time. “You’ve worked hard, I 
think.” </p>
<p>“You didn’t even expect yourself to work today, so it’s fine if you’d like an early break. I can fill 
in,” Janie obliged.  </p>
<p>“Oh, thanks. Then we’ll just. . .” Olena turned, leaving her scooper in the food. She paid no 
attention to her width, nor the fullness of her swing. The side of her soft beanbag spun and 
ricocheted off another soft surface. For once, the motion of her ocean of titty didn’t phase her so 
much as what she had collided with—
Nicole?” </p>
<p>she had collided with “. . . Take. O-our break. 
who
​</p>
<p>​
 
There, with Janie on her arm, was the woman who had started it all.  </p>
<hr />
<p>Nicole looked as gorgeous as ever. </p>
<p>A stylish, green and red outfit barely holding her body in; more casual business than business 
casual. She wore a blouse with Christmas lights printed on the front that buttoned up, but her 
candy cane leggings wouldn’t jive in any managerial meeting. The mini blazer over her 
shoulders was green but formal while the way her silver hair was braided and pulled into a 
ponytail screamed ‘commoner’.  </p>
<p>Then, there were her curves, mashed charmingly into the outfit.  </p>
<p>Blouse undone by three buttons, slits of see-through in the leggings, hair pulled back to expose 
her long, slender neck. Olena smelled peppermint just being so close to her, eyes drawn in by 
her cleavage which was still sloshing from when her boobs had ping-ponged off her crush’s pair.  </p>
<p>They seemed. . . bigger. Nicole had always been stacked, but it was a normal kind of ‘busty’. 
Nicole’s size now was definitely on par with Janie’s; still smaller than Olena but in that range 
where people will double take for the tits themselves instead of for the full package of woman. </p>
<p>In that thought, though, came Olena’s realization. “Janie. . .” she mouthed.  </p>
<p>“Yes? Is everything alright?” Janie leaned forward, partly leaving Nicole behind her.  </p>
<p>“Your name isn’t Janie. It’s Jane. Y-you’re Nicole’s Jane?” </p>
<p>Janie blinked slowly, turned to look at Nicole for a moment. “My name is ‘Janie’. It’s a nickname. 
And yea, I guess I’m hers. She’s my partner. Why? Have the two of you met?” </p>
<p>Nicole held Olena’s eyes. To Olena’s surprise, it was like she was asking for permission. “She’s, 
uh, the one I told you about, remember? From the hotel.” </p>
<p>“Hmm. The lactating one?” Janie said, as if that wasn’t as bizarre a thing to characterize a 
person as, say, a hair color.  </p>
<p>“Lactating?” Clarissa asked. </p>
<p>“The one from Crafty Shack. The puzzle girl. The one I spent a night with.” </p>
<p>Janie snapped her fingers and pointed toward Olena. “Makes complete sense now. Wow, yea. 
Okay. She must have grown since you last saw her—man, this town really is small, that she 
would just be wandering around nearby.” </p>
<p>Nicole shrugged. “It’s home.” </p>
<p>Janie hugged Nicole’s bicep, a frown forming on her face. “Well, I found her out on her own on 
Christmas Eve alone. Alone! It was so sad! Gosh, had I known who you were, Olena, I would 
have stopped you after one lap. Nobody that Nicole holds in such high regard should be alone 
on the Holidays.” </p>
<p>Olena winced. “What sort of ‘high regard’.” </p>
<p>Nicole glared down at Janie, but the ginger blabbered on as if she couldn’t feel the knives 
stabbing her in the back of her head. “This woman has not stopped thinking about you since 
that night you two had. I swear! It’s the cutest thing. She looked so sad at breakfast and when I 
asked why, she just opened the floodgates on me—Olena is mad, Olena is gorgeous, Olena 
wants bigger boobs but won’t get them because you two will never meet again.” Janie looked 
up, saw how vexed Nicole was, then swooped up onto her toes for a swift peck on the lips. With 
the wealth and power Nicole had, it almost seemed like Janie was teasing a mountain 
lioness—and was getting away with it. “I’ve tried to get her to go back to the Crafty Shack but 
she’s too shy to confront you. Then she heard from that girl Hedda at the hotel desk that her 
sister and you are back together—gosh, Nicole wouldn’t get out of bed all morning after that 
news.” </p>
<p>“You two were just about to go on break, is that right?” Nicole said, grumpy and low. “You look 
tired. Take all the time in the world. Take the car for a spin if you want—I’ve got the keys here. 
Go. Now. Please. . .” </p>
<p>“Oh and last night—. . .” </p>
<p>“Babe!” Nicole complained.  </p>
<p>Janie giggled at the benefactor’s embarrassment. “We’d just had dinner and were about to pay 
when I looked at her phone—. . .  </p>
<p>“Jane! Enough!” </p>
<p>“She was looking up puzzles online. Puzzles. She was going to buy you one for Christmas and 
leave it with your manager. Can you believe how dopey she is?” </p>
<p>No. Olena really couldn’t. “I guess you really meant that stuff you said, huh?” Olena asked. It 
was strange, but now that there was another side to Nicole’s coin—crumbly romantic brat and </p>
<p>savvy business woman together—it made it much easier to be around her. “About being able to 
tell when you need someone in your life. You really believe that we’re supposed to be together.” </p>
<p>Nicole’s sigh could have blown the building down. “I do feel very strongly about that, yes.” </p>
<p>Clarissa, quickly realizing that she was being pushed out of the conversation, gave Olena a pat 
on the back. “Olena. . .” </p>
<p>“Oh! Sorry. Guys, you already know Clarissa. I met her at the Crafty Shack during the big sale. 
Clarissa, I met Nicole the same night but we met again about a week later.” </p>
<p>“Yes,” Nicole said. “Met.” </p>
<p>“And she’s in love with you?” Clarissa asked. It sounded so bald without Janie giving any 
context. </p>
<p>Olena looked to Nicole. Janie looked to Nicole. Clarissa looked to Nicole. </p>
<p>Nicole looked at the ground. Finally, she said, “Let’s discuss this over lunch, shall we?” </p>
<p>————— </p>
<p>Outside the back of the church were a small fleet of sleek, black limousines. Nicole put Olena 
and Clarissa in one and gave instructions secretly to the driver, then promised that she would 
be behind them in yet another lengthy vehicle. The look on her face held trepidation. Even as 
she gave succinct orders and looked confident with the directions, she didn’t look Olena’s way 
when she walked past the window. </p>
<p>What was going on? </p>
<p>Clarissa grilled Olena sufficiently to be caught up, though Olena felt compelled to speak 
anyway. “Sorry for getting you involved in this. It’s been, uh, a slowly unfolding catastrophe for 
me. The more I try to keep people out, the more they seem to tumble in.” </p>
<p>“It’s the instant love thing I was talking about, I bet,” Clarissa shrugged. “Something in the air. 
It’s that time of year.” Her hair was mostly black but turned to a rusty red at the roots. Without 
the hairnet, it magically morphed back into a freshly layered style; looked fabulous, especially in 
a gentle side sweep. “Or maybe, based on how you described Nicole, there could be magic 
afoot.” </p>
<p>“I think it’s magic. It just has to be,” said Olena, adjusting herself in her seat for what seemed 
like the millionth time. She suddenly realized how weird it was to discuss magic as the cause to </p>
<p>to be magic. Just 
has
​</p>
<p>her roaring sex drive and instant attraction. “Or, um, I-I. . . I don’t mean it 
that. . .” </p>
<p>“Tough getting comfortable?” asked Olena’s travelling partner. “You’re been adjusting yourself 
quite a bit; your boobs.” </p>
<p>“They’re at that awkward size now,” Olena answered, then began a demonstration. Her plush 
walls of lovely flesh ran down her thighs and over her knees like flowing water. The pastel 
yellow sweater had held on all this time and Olena felt all the luckier that she and Jersey had 
managed to find something so flexible and flattering. “There’s just enough of me hanging off my 
lap that they slip over and pull toward the ground. So, I have to lean back extra far and pull them 
back, only to have them slip and fall again.” </p>
<p>“One of those ridiculously busty girl problems, I guess. If you don’t mind my asking, what size 
are you?” </p>
<p>“Sure. R cup.” </p>
<p>Clarissa tilted her head like she really hadn’t heard Olena clearly. “Say what?”  </p>
<p>Olena turned to her and repeated it. “R cup. . .” </p>
<p>Clarissa shook her head like a puppy drying herself. ”I, uh. Okay, I knew they were big but I 
wasn’t expecting an actual letter to exist—one that measures boobs of  that size, I mean. Wow. 
R cup. R. . . R? Impressive—that you measured. Holy mother of—. . . I’m sitting next to R cups. 
. .” </p>
<p>It had to have been the cutest reaction to her boobs she’d gotten yet. Olena couldn’t help 
laughing, a wide smile curled her lips. She hadn’t felt so good all day. She’d even forgotten that 
she was about to have another confrontation with Nicole at an unknown location; that her family 
gathering ended in ruin and that her tits tingled with growth every time anything festive went on 
around her. </p>
<p>“What?!” Clarissa shouted, shoving Olena’s shoulder. “Stop laughing!” </p>
<p>“You’re too cute! Oh god, I needed that. Nobody has reacted like that before.” It was actually 
how Olena had expected people to react at first, back when her growing had just begun. It was 
what she’d been so afraid of every time she grew—that just hearing her cup size would bring 
shock. It’s how her family had reacted when she showed them today.  </p>
<p>And yet this moment was so, so different. Sure, the reaction was the same, but the impression 
of it was not. Her family had been stunned into what felt like rejection. Clarissa was frozen in 
wonder, confusion, and, frankly, lust. </p>
<p>​
 
“Nobody?! Are you, like, surrounded by people who see huge chests everyday? If so, I’m never 
leaving your side. I’ve got to meet those people—sounds incredible! And stop laughing! Jeez.” </p>
<p>A tear came to Olena’s eye and she was uncertain if it was one of happiness or sadness; happy 
for this moment, sad that it had taken so long to feel this way. “I’m sorry! So sorry. Here, can I 
make it up to you?” </p>
<p>“Yes! You’d better.” Clarissa wiggled her neck in a gesture of sass that was comically unlike her. </p>
<p>Olena took Clarissa’s hand, marvelled at the softness of her fingers, and pulled the paw over to 
her left breast. Since Clarissa was seated on her right side, the pull put their faces close 
together and Clarissa’s body leaning against Olena’s impressive pillow. “Have a feel.” </p>
<p>“Oh. . . Oh, wow—that’s so soft! Like, I knew they were soft but this soft? My mind is blown right 
now—dang, Olena. I-I. . . Can I—. . .” Clarissa blabbered.  </p>
<p>Olena cut her off. “Do whatever you want. You can’t hurt them.” </p>
<p>But to Olena’s surprise, Clarissa didn’t go for groping, rubbing, or bouncing. Instead, her face 
transformed the same way it did in the staff lounge on the day they met—eyes lidded, lips 
inviting, breasts pressed against Olena’s globes. </p>
<p>And they kissed. </p>
<p>Olena tasted the sweetness Clarissa had wanted to share for days as they took each other with 
their mouths. The sighs of relief and commitment to the kiss filled the small space, a heated 
gesture of care to insulate them from the world wizzing past them at forty miles an hour. 
Clarissa, despite her less-than-sexual demeanor had to have been the best kisser among those 
who Olena had kissed. Jersey and Nicole had knowledge and talent, but Clarissa’s mouth 
shape just won out by merit of it’s warm invitation.  </p>
<p>Just as the kiss grew moist and their moans more frequent, Clarissa’s hands began to explore 
the silky mountain she halfway laid upon. Her hand scooped in entire tufts, forming gentle rolls 
and bends in Olena’s impressive flesh. It not only felt amazing to be played with, but Olena felt 
the warm wholesomeness from realizing that Clarissa had become so affixed to her huge titties 
that her kissing slowed to a frozen, moaning purr.  </p>
<p>“They’re good, are they?” Olena whispered, abandoning their makeout to just enjoy the feel of a 
tiny hand scrubbing her tops and sides adamantly. “Fun to play with.” She found herself 
enjoying Clarissa’s neck with travelling smooches. </p>
<p>“I think I’m complete. I didn’t know it would take so little to make me happy—and it’s probably 
the magic love or whatever, but I could be content with life if all it had in it was your phenomenal 
body.” Clarissa curled her neck up, fell into a rushed, horny kiss before departing again for more 
exploration.  </p>
<p>“Wow, yea,” Olena bobbed her head. “Yup, my nipples are hard. Man, you know how to use that 
mouth.” </p>
<p>“Do I kiss well?” </p>
<p>“You kiss like a chilly pool in hundred degree weather, Clarissa.” Olena admitted. “I’ve kissed a 
good handful of girls and nobody has done it quite like you.” </p>
<p>She was already blushing, but her lips did a puckered sort of smile as she crawled onto the floor 
of the cabin. It didn’t take much searching to find Olena’s nipple as the sweater was pulled to its 
limits by the engorged, throbbing mound. “You’re actually the first girl I’ve kissed. And I know 
this is a stretch, what with Nicole and everything, but I’m really not looking forward to kissing any 
other girls. . .” </p>
<p>“I’m that bad?” Olena’s brow furrowed.  </p>
<p>“No.” Clarissa answered simply, pulling her hair away from her face as she leaned toward the 
front of Olena’s attention-grabbing knob. “I only ever want to kiss you.”  </p>
<p>Then she pressed herself into Olena’s fronts, losing herself in the near-gooey quality of her 
bulbousness. Her fingers worked, squeezing all that she could beneath her tiny hands so even 
more flesh bubbled up and overloaded her sense of touch. The sweater was skin tight at that 
point, pulled to a thinness that approached nudity so all Clarissa would have been able to feel 
was warmth radiating off of Olena’s twin ovens.  </p>
<p>What Olena felt was the heat of a mouth surrounding her. In all her grandiose size and 
eye-turning vastness, her nipple felt like a tiny piece of chocolate; just melting away with 
Clarissa’s mouth around it. The working of a tongue sent her into throes, reaching for whatever 
swath of her own size she could fist and clamping a heap of her own titties just to contain the 
richness. Moan floated out of her—some by choice, others pulled from her like Clarissa had 
fished them from her desirous soul. She felt the moisture oozing from sloppy kissing lips, the 
cute puffs of breath, the occasional grind of teeth. Pleasure masked the air around them with a 
sweetness. It felt so stunningly good! </p>
<p>“Holy hell. Mmm, damn Clarissa. Clarissa!” Olena’s voice climbed the ladder of satisfaction.  </p>
<p>Knowing her efforts weren’t in vain, Clarissa doubled them. She pushed her whole weight into 
Olena’s right udder. As if the sweater protection wasn’t there, the girl stuffed her mouth and </p>
<p>cheeks with flesh like she was attempting to swallow. Lovely bulges of Olena’s titty bent over 
Clarissa’s forehead and below her chin. Her face felt so fiery with sexual blushing that Olena 
could feel it on her sensitive skin.  </p>
<p>“Mmm! Mmhmm,” Clarissa groaned. Then, “Ahhmmn!” she would say as she pulled away with a 
giggle and remounted, going for even more softness.  </p>
<p>Olena shivered, enraptured by it all. Her tits had always seemed impossible to control. The 
limousine ride itself made them bounce erratically; traversing potholes or accelerating to make it 
under a changing light. But Clarissa had a talent for making Olena feel whopping without being 
out of control. She felt just right inside Clarissa’s warm, moist mouth. The flicks from her tongue 
and the deep, sucking inhales had a way of making Olena feel manageable. </p>
<p>Olena’s thoughts were consumed by this image when the blinding spread of white light took her. 
Orgasm blasted over her. Before she could even prepare herself she went heavenward; eyes 
rolling, body tense then lax. She caringly sent her fingers forward, dragging them through the 
dark, frizzled hair she knew to be before her. Instead of soothing, it seemed to rile Clarissa 
further, as she ground her nose into Olena’s still-sensitive front and clenched her jaw; firm, 
strong. </p>
<p>“Ah! A-ahhnn, yea,” Olena moaned, still reeling from one climax and already working toward the 
next. It only occurred to her then that Clarissa had found her own rapture just by sucking Olena 
through her sweater. “God, you’re so good. Such a good friend, Clarissa. I. . . I don’t know what 
to say.” </p>
<p>Olena was as patient as she needed to by. Clarrisa seemed thoroughly taken by her own peak. 
It was at least a minute before her jaw finally stopped squeezing and her body lazed back onto 
her haunches. Leaning, Olena could see the paleness of her face juxtaposed against candy red 
cheeks and swollen lips. Clarissa easily took cuteness to another level.  </p>
<p>“Y-you even taste good. People don’t taste good—you taste good, though,” she babbled, 
incoherent. The hoarseness in her voice was a dead turn on. “How can a person taste good? So 
sweet and yet salty and. . . I need some water.” </p>
<p>Olena burst into titters. “Come here, babe. I’ve got you. There’s a button to call the driver.” </p>
<p>Clarissa crawled back into the spot next to Olena—crawled because, at her own admission, “I 
can’t use my legs. They’re jello.” </p>
<p>Olena helped her up and scooped her close, then paged for the driver with the big red button 
she’d been instructed to press in case there was a request.  </p>
<p>Of course, the driver was female. Given Nicole’s taste, she was likely also gorgeous. “How may 
I help you?” </p>
<p>“Is there any water available?” asked Olena. </p>
<p>“There is a cooler in the side panel toward the back of the cabin. You should see a double-red 
line. Press into the wall and the drink tray will be available to you.” </p>
<p>Sure enough, the area to press was just in reach. Olena pressed on the two lines. When she 
released, a hydraulic system let out a vat of an ice chest with glasses—actual glass bottles—of 
spring water, as well as their choice of alcohol. Neither of them were old enough for that, so she 
settled on water freshly retrieved from the top of some important mountain somewhere. Clarissa 
loved the taste so much she offered Olena a drink after just tasting it.  </p>
<p>Perfect quality, obviously. Everything Nicole’s money could afford. </p>
<p>“I do suggest you refrain from much of the alcohol though, as we are nearing our destination. 
Miss Nicole informed me that there would be ample opportunities for food and beverage where 
we are going.” </p>
<p>Olena looked at Clarissa. She looked curious but content. </p>
<p>“Where might there be opportunities for food and drink on Christmas Eve?” Olena wondered out 
loud.  </p>
<p>“Restaurants are closed. We just left the church where they were feeding the homeless. Another 
church, maybe?” </p>
<p>“Who knows.” </p>
<p>“Nervous?” Clarissa’s lips caressed Olena’s cheek, then shifted further and further south. 
“Because I’m hydrated and ready for another round.” </p>
<p>“She said we’ll be at our destination shortly,” Olena kissed Clarissa’s forehead, seeing it already 
retreat down toward the floor.  </p>
<p>“I’ll make it quick. It’s not fair that only one booby gets love.” </p>
<p>Apparently, there was a festival.  </p>
<p>————— </p>
<p>Nicole’s foundation had put the event together to celebrate Christmas and to bring a community 
still recovering from fires together for one night of all-expenses-paid fun. There were bounce 
houses on corners, carollers walking up and down the streets, and streetlights outfitted with 
flashing winter designs; snowflakes, reindeer, nutcrackers. On both sides of Wilmont—the 
central street of downtown Bristlebank—were stalls selling food and drink and wares.  </p>
<p>Most important, people seemed happy. In the wake of the fires, a local zeitgeist of fear and 
distrust had filled the city. Nobody wanted to mention it. Still, it was in the gait of those that 
came in contact with one another, how they looked or didn’t look. No smiles were exchanged. 
Phones and watches suddenly became the most important things to look at. Doors to cars and 
homes were locked at all times, as were the hearts of many Bristlebankers—or, uh, whatever 
they called themselves.  </p>
<p>Olena stepped out of the luxury vehicle and immediately lost her words. The lightness of the air 
and the spirit of the people around made her breathless. It was how she imagined an 
amusement park would feel if her father had been less tight fisted with their money and taken 
them to one.  </p>
<p>Clarissa said it best. “I haven’t seen people this happy since the Bristlebank Centennial 
Celebration—and I was ten years old for that.” </p>
<p>They began to walk, arms naturally lacing as they went. The games and conversation 
happening around her were all Christmas related, so she tried to keep toward the center of the 
road. It helped. She didn’t feel like she would spontaneously inflate for once in the whole 
damned month of December. Instead, she felt warm for other reasons.  </p>
<p>Here she was, cutie by her side, the body of her dreams, walking through a town restored by the 
holidays that she’d always loved as a kid. Even if the day started out rocky—or 
apocalyptic—they were looking up significantly for the moment.  </p>
<p>“What are you thinking about?” Clarissa asked.  </p>
<p>“Am I making a thinking face?” countered Olena. </p>
<p>“Yes. A happy thinking face.” </p>
<p>“I’m thinking that things aren’t so bad right now.” </p>
<p>“Why would you think that? Ooo, cotton candy. I wonder if it’ll make my tongue blue!” </p>
<p>Olena felt the pull on her arm and sighed as she was towed to the side; body first, then 
voluptuous melon titties. They reached the stall and found that all of the sweets being given out 
were free of charge. The seller was a man that Olena recognized as the Candy Man who sold </p>
<p>homemade treats for a few coins. She could normally find a spare dime or two between the 
couch cushions and sneak off to rot her teeth on some taffy, so he recognized her dorky face.  </p>
<p>“You disappeared! I used to see you once a week, but I always knew you’d turn into your dad 
and start saving your pennies instead of blowing it on cavity starters. Looks like you’ve gone 
and grown up on me after all these years—in financial smarts as well as beauty,” said Mr. 
Winston. He had a full head of black hair even though he had to be in his late fifties. He didn’t 
seem the type obsessed with appearances enough to dye it, either. Olena shot the breeze; 
couldn’t help but be amazed at how he seemed so comfortable to see the customer he knew at 
the age of ten now that she was twenty, and a woman, and sporting S cup, gummy-bear-soft 
breasts. “And found yourself a beautiful girlfriend, too? Good for you. I say, this winter really has 
turned Bristlebank around. Couldn’t possibly have done it without that Nicole lady. She 
sponsored and catered everything here.” </p>
<p>“Whoa. She’s, like, mega rich,” said Clarissa. She took a wand of cotton candy the size of a 
watermelon; electric blue with little shards of crystallized sugar. She not-so-subtly held it up next 
to Olena’s chest and tsked as she compared the two while Mr. Winston had his back turned. 
“Not even close. Poor candy. Can be as big as my head and still not as soft or sweet as my 
girlfriend’s 
sweet treats.” 
​</p>
<p>Olena gave Clarissa a bump of the shoulder which Clarissa returned by angling her chest so 
that their boobs padded one another instead. It was like a bathtub toy coming across an 
iceberg, which did strike Olena as funny.  </p>
<p>She couldn’t let the candy and her clear advantage in the chesticle department distract her, 
though. She spoke on after she thanked Mr. Winston for serving them. “Do you have any idea 
where she is? She was supposed to be right behind us and we’re supposed to meet her.” </p>
<p>“Well, she was supposed to be hosting the Bristlebank First Annual Puzzlepalooza, but I think 
that got started about fifteen minutes ago. Likely gone from there by now,” he said.  </p>
<p>Clarissa and Olena locked eyes. “Bristlebank First Annual Puzzlepalooza?” they said at the 
same time. </p>
<p>“Why yes! She sponsored that too. And the winner gets a massive prize—some vacation 
somewhere fancy. We hit the lottery with her, yes we did. I love puzzles! And if business wasn’t 
bopping so, I’d close down shop and win that trip to who-knows-where-ville. My wife is always 
asking for a vacation. Oh well. At the rate I’m selling, I’ll be able to buy her a ticket anywhere 
she wants.” </p>
<p>That tore it. Olena thanked Mr. Winston again—he seemed happier to discuss sending his wife 
off for a week so he could have the home to himself—and swiftly turned to leave. This time, she </p>
<p>was the one to pull Clarissa along as she plowed her way toward the opposite end of the 
Christmas Day Festival.  </p>
<p>When the crowd thickened, she heard bouncy electronic music being pumped through large, 
black speakers. A stage stretched over the ground like a black shield, miles of the park elevated 
off the dead grass turf below. On stage were about two dozen tables, covered by a huge tarp to 
keep the weather out. Stepping onto the stage and under the tarp felt like walking into the big 
top of a circus. The food smells made the air feel like butter to move through, so thick and sweet 
and pleasant to breathe.  </p>
<p>But sweeter on Olena’s nose was the trademark hint of cardstock and expensive paints. A guy 
with a bald head had creases in his brow, then he clapped a whooped when he finally found the 
place for the piece he’d been looking to place. At another table, a pair of young girls poured 
over a bag of pieces, sorting them by color and pattern.  </p>
<p>Puzzlepalooza.  </p>
<p>“Whoa! This is puzzle heaven. Look, they even have arcade machines over there.” </p>
<p>Olena turned. Projected onto one of the walls, about thirty feet tall, was an arcade puzzle game 
she recognized. If she listened close, over the dull drone of voices and shuffling, she could 
make out the catchy tune that played on repeat at her house for hours.  </p>
<p>She found herself getting emotional.  </p>
<p>“Olena? Hey, don’t cry. This is great—this is totally you.” </p>
<p>Olena sniffled, not yet teary but quickly approaching. “This is amazing. H-how did—how could 
anyone
.” 
​</p>
<p>Then their eyes met.  </p>
<p>Just when she wanted to see her most, Nicole turned and found her eyes. The thoughtful, 
wealthy mogul was shaking hands with some guy in a blazer and pressed pants. Clearly, an 
important person. But she broke away with a pleasant grin and paced across the stage to 
Olena’s side.  </p>
<p>Olena couldn’t breathe. Not only was she overwhelmed by Puzzlepalooza, but by Nicole 
actually wearing a figure-hugging laticed turtleneck; putting her pleasant curves on full display.  </p>
<p>“Jane told me about how your holiday has been. I had planned to hold this whole festival thing 
the week leading up to New Years—which is why the live entertainment hasn’t arrived and the 
fireworks aren’t set—but I hated that what I did made your Christmas so difficult.” Nicole had </p>
<p>been looking far off; at the tables, the arcade, the concession stand selling carnival food in the 
corner. But she faced Olena with a coy smile when she said, “So, uh, Merry Christmas. Hope 
you like your gift.” </p>
<p>Chapter 6 
Santa. . . Baby 
Word Count: 6242 </p>
<p>Olena couldn't believe it. A woman had thrown a party the size of all of downtown just for her.  </p>
<p>"B-but the streets are decorated. And there's people here—where did you get all the people on 
Christmas? And there's food and puzzles, and—a-and. . ." Olena blinked to keep her eyes from 
bugging. "You spent so much money. How much money?" </p>
<p>"It doesn't matter. . ." Nicole began, but when she saw how she was behaving, she immediately 
flipped her script. Her fingers combed through her beautiful silver hair, which had been styled 
into a ribbon of sparkling mercury. "Sorry. I had my people make a bunch of phone calls. The 
food is being catered by locals, mostly, so with the right incentive they came out. Then I had 
some muscle flown in from a construction company a few towns over. The COO owed me a 
favor. And most of the people came when I made a post about the free food, entertainment, and 
chances to win even more prizes. I gained a following with all the appearances I've been making 
for the past month." </p>
<p>"That's insane," Olena muttered. Her mouth was dry, nerves had stolen her ability to put more 
than a few syllables together without stammering.  </p>
<p>"That's super-rich," Clarissa commented. Her cotton candy looked like a waning moon with how 
much of it she'd worked through, and her teeth were like blue icicles from her voracity.  </p>
<p>Nicole stood up a little straighter and her mouth formed an 'O' like she'd forgotten something. 
"Right. And I also used some magic. I'm, uh, a little powerful right now. It's sort of that time for 
me. . ." </p>
<p>"That time? Magic?" Olena's chin locked and unlocked as the urge to speak came and went. "I 
need to sit down. I can't tell if I'm tired or delusional." </p>
<p>Nicole offered her one of many folding chairs strewn throughout the circus tent. Olena took it 
without rebuttal, just happy to be off her feet. She hadn't realized how much her size had taxed 
her body; how S cup breasts made muscles she didn't know she had clench and cramp when 
she was stressed.  </p>
<p>"Do you need anything?" Nicole asked.  </p>
<p>"I-I could use something to drink," answered Olena, teeth grinding against her will. She added 
something to the end, wrapping her sigh around the words to hide them. "And a reason to 
believe this whole stunt wasn't done just for me. . ." </p>
<p>Clarissa stepped in. "I'll get it. She needs her rest. I'm Clarissa. I'm Olena's girlfriend," she 
blurted, holding out a hand to Nicole who she had met earlier but never while wearing the 
'girlfriend' badge.  </p>
<p>The businesswoman shook it; squinted with befuddlement. "Pleasure's mine." </p>
<p>"Be back in a second. Don't go anywhere," Clarissa told Olena, then kissed her on the cheek 
and skipped off, eyes on all the lights and sounds and smells and motions.  </p>
<p>Nicole waited for her to get out of earshot before sighing. "Your girlfriend is going to be in that 
line for a while. Even with the help, it's pretty long. Here." She fished a phone out of her 
cleavage and began swiping and tapping with her thumb. "Help is on the way." </p>
<p>"Nicole," Olena said.  </p>
<p>She'd said it with an urgency that pulled Nicole close. "Yes, Olena? Are you uncomfortable? 
Here." The silver-haired woman waved her hand even as she leaned over to inspect Olena's 
body.  </p>
<p>"No, no. I'm fine, I just. . ." Olena began, but she instantly felt the crinkle of her body as it 
unwound. She suddenly felt relief flooding cool and easy into her. It was like a massage, but the 
painful grinding and jabbing of a stranger's thumbs and elbows were all skipped over. She felt 
limber and loose without a single touch. Best of all, her S cup breasts didn't feel so damned 
heavy. "M-my body. It's so light." </p>
<p>"I made you a little stronger, actually—good job on your wishing, by the way. Some people wish 
they weren't so damned heavy or big, which forces me into doing boob reductions; not my 
preferred method of spreading Christmas cheer. You wished you were stronger. That's always a 
pleasant wish to grant." </p>
<p>"Wishes? Now you're a genie, then?" </p>
<p>"When did people start thinking that genies were the only people that granted wishes?" Nicole 
rolled her eyes as if she knew a genie back in high school that she hated for being the popular 
girl in class. "And yea, I can. Really, I can sort of do what I want with people, but it makes things 
infinitely easier if the people openly make the wish for themselves. Much easier to just sprinkle a 
bit of power into the words to make them real, that way. Words are already plenty powerful on 
their own." </p>
<p>"But I never wished anything out loud." </p>
<p>"I just took your desire to grow even larger and combined it with your desire to not be so 
strained. Creative liberties." </p>
<p>Olena stood—no, she bounded up out of her seat. She hadn't felt so energized ever in her 
entire life. Even when she was flat, she didn't feel so in control of her own body. Maybe she 
didn't see the muscles anywhere, but she felt them at work by how easy it was to move about.  </p>
<p>"And the buzzing in my tits has gone done. Oh thank goodness, I just feel normal." </p>
<p>Nicole didn't say much at that admission. "Yup. Happy for you, beloved." </p>
<p>"I-I think I could do a cartwheel," Olena said as she rose onto her toes. She stuck out a leg 
experimentally and found that she could balance much easier. "I feel as good as I did when I 
was a kid. </p>
<p>"Trust me, beautiful, there is nothing 'kiddish' about you." </p>
<p>Olena realized that the newfound spring in her step was translating to springs in other parts of 
her body. Her titties were trouncing happily, pulled along by her exuberance. It beat the hell out 
of being dragged around by momentum. That was for sure. And Olena would choose her 
current state above anything else as far as ease of movement—combining bustiness with 
coordination was the perfect recipe:  </p>
<p>For her bodily joy, yes, but also for accidentally turning her body into a performance.  </p>
<p>Now that her titties followed her, she couldn't stop them from moving. At least when they were 
heavy they managed to find a point and settle into surface-level jiggles. When she turned with 
her new strength, her S cup breasts behaved like perky little D cups—every little thing set them 
off. Her body was the vehicle for the lewdest breast fetish dreams imaginable; tits that could 
overflow her lap but acted like they lived in a bouncy house.  </p>
<p>People were watching her; heads up from their tasks of locking in the puzzle perimeter first or 
organizing pieces by color. Their varied reactions to her—impressed, humored, judgemental, 
repulsed—stressed her further. Of course, her defensive mind only recorded the negative looks; 
women who were beautiful themselves cursing her for being that much bigger than everyone </p>
<p>else, conservatively-minded others that probably thought she'd gone to extreme lengths to get 
such an extreme body.  </p>
<p>That she's too busty, too arousing, too much.  </p>
<p>Olena went still and commanded herself not to move an inch. That stopped most of the 'fun' 
being had by the onlookers. Her breathing still animated her fronts, turning them into beanbags 
rising and falling in a hypnotic, lilting drift.  </p>
<p>"You really are magic," Olena said, blushing. "You took my pain away—you created 
Puzzlepalooza. And you made so many women in Bristlebank a lot prettier. . ." </p>
<p>"Just giving people what they want. It's crazy how many women are insecure about their bodies. 
I just gave them more of what they wanted—even your 'girlfriend', Clarissa, asked for a few 
changes." Nicole had sounded sardonic when talking about Clarissa. But then she played with 
her hair and looked to the distance; a nervous tick from what Olena could see. "And yes. I made 
Puzzlepalooza. I couldn't let someone like you have a bad Holiday. You're too precious to me. " </p>
<p>Olena soured. "But you don't even know me." </p>
<p>"I. . ." Nicole paused to sigh; tucked her arms under her breasts, hands clutching her sides. "I 
just know. I just do, okay?" </p>
<p>"How? Is that magic too—that you can be so sure about me? Because I don't know you. I'm not 
magical." It wasn't that she wasn't happy to have her mobility restored to her. It wasn't even that 
she didn't fantasize, in that singular moment, of how Nicole's cinched arms pushed her bosom 
up so delightfully. It was that she didn't know. She faced the void when she faced Nicole.  </p>
<p>She feared that void; what it was doing to her and her life. Too much this month had changed; 
more than she was comfortable with. Working hard and being patient were the only things she 
trusted—it was part of her upbringing. No matter how much she appreciated, loved, and valued 
every little improvement on her life—the recent acquisition of multiple sexual partners, giant 
boobs that stuffed any imaginable top, giant boobs that destroyed any top they didn't stretch, 
giant boobs, giant boobs, giant boobs—she couldn't resist how she was raised or what she'd 
grown to believe was important: working diligently and waiting patiently were the way forward in 
life. It's why she loved puzzles so much.  </p>
<p>But it was also why she couldn't truly trust Nicole.  </p>
<p>Then, in the tense silence, came a voice. </p>
<p>"You're not magical? Perfect! I was getting kind of tired of Nicky bringing home supernatural 
being after supernatural being. It's like she never outgrew her boy band phase—except replace 
boy bands with guitar-playing genies. . ." </p>
<p>Nicole's last relationship was with a genie? </p>
<p>Olena was surprised to turn and see someone so close; a person she didn't recognize. That fact 
didn't mean much since there were plenty of people she didn't exactly know. Her town wasn't 
that small. Still, she would have recognized a woman like the one that came up to her now.  </p>
<p>Nicole was turned slightly away but faced the approaching woman with a familiarity. "Sup. You 
bring what I asked?" </p>
<p>"Apple Pie Cider without alcohol for the lovely lady." She extended a heavy-duty plastic cup to 
Olena, who froze. "C'mon, cutie, it isn't poison. I just look mean, but I'm actually nice once you 
get to know me." </p>
<p>"Don't trust her," Nicole huffed. "I can smell the booze in that from here. What is with you? 
Trying to get all my dates drunk?" </p>
<p>The woman gave her drink a sniff and swooned in appreciation. "Ah, yea. That one's my Apple 
Pie Cider. Extra alcohol. Whoops." The woman tilted her chin back for a long drink of the 
steaming beverage. The fluid bulged her long, lithe neck as she chugged what was meant to be 
sipped—throughout a whole night, by the smell of it.  </p>
<p>Olena's eyes trailed over her as she drank; didn't find her lacking in any regard. Her hair was a 
sweet orange-blonde, styled into a spiky waterfall on her left side. It complimented the piercings 
in her nose and ears and the dark, goth tank she wore under a layer of fish netting. Her jeans 
were so tight, it looked like the only way to get into them would have been to start three sizes 
smaller and grow into them. And, of course, they matched the theme of being edgy by being 
acid-washed and distressed. Gashes and holes littered the denim showing off a wealth of her 
huge, curvy thighs.  </p>
<p>Olena didn't skip over her breasts for any reason other than they were exactly of the quality she 
would expect of a person associated with Nicole: firm, round, and huge. While Nicole beat this 
mystery woman by a few sizes up top, the goth rocker sported a waist that was somehow even 
skinnier and hips that flared more delightfully.  </p>
<p>In short, Nicole's body doubled down in its busty strength while Nicole's cohort sported an 
enigmatic, moody hourglass. Both had their appeal.  </p>
<p>"Olena," Nicole said, snapping Olena out of what was, unfortunately, an immediate erotic 
attraction. "This is my sister Peach. She's second to youngest and very prone to making such 
'mistakes'." Her politeness vanished as she addressed her sister. "You know she's underaged, 
right? Getting alcohol for a minor is against the law." </p>
<p>Peach regarded Olena. Her face went hard and angry for a moment as if disgusted by the idea 
that Olena couldn't legally drink. In fact, Olena began to think she'd done something wrong and 
had to remind herself that she had done nothing but sit and be waited upon by two crazy sisters.  </p>
<p>"First off, fuck the law. I do what I want." Peach did exactly what she wanted by isolating a 
middle finger; not at anyone present but at the general presence of 'the law'. "And not drinking 
makes you sound like a miserably shitty person, Olena. Good thing you're cute, though—I'll 
overlook the fact that you're law-abiding," Peach answered. "Even if I didn't, I couldn't stay mad </p>
<p>at you. You sweet girls drive me nuts—like, split me in two and show me what your mouth does. 
Nuts! Seriously, it's so dumb how adorable women just fall into Nicole's lap." </p>
<p>"Quite the contrary. I scout year-round, and keep notes, and am very well-organized. It's literally 
all I do. I stay busy, Peachy, unlike you." </p>
<p>Olena tightened at that comment, a shiver racing over her. Nicole had scouted and researched 
for her. How long had it been going on? Was their meeting at the Crafty Shack luck or scripted? 
Either way, the thought of being sought out rang as both heroic and creepy. Olena didn't know 
which sentiment would win out. </p>
<p>"Blah blah blah, you aren't my mom and I'm not your kid—thank god. I think I'd die of boredom." 
Peach kneeled next to Olena, switch flipped from mockery to delight. "Tell me, darling. Does 
boring, vanilla lesbian romance ever bore you? Have you ever thought about what it would be 
like to do something a little dangerous? That's what I'm about; weird, fun, wild danger. I'd like to 
show you sometime. . ." </p>
<p>Olena's tension hadn't left so her response clipped. "Dangerous how?" </p>
<p>"You know. Dangerous. Or maybe you don't—maybe you're that innocent. Okay, so imagine a 
hot chick, right? Now, imagine a hot chick, but with a—. . . " </p>
<p>"Peach. Drop it. Go get that cider I asked for. Now," Nicole commanded. </p>
<p>A visible flash of goosebumps broke out over Peach's beautifully tanned skin. Her body knotted 
like she'd had to stop an impulse to move when commanded to. "For fuck's sake, Nicky. Jeez. 
Somebody's not exactly coy about using her powers on the holidays. Save some for the 
reindeer and sleigh, will ya?" </p>
<p>"Peach!" Nicole scolded, somehow managing to up the aggression by lowering the volume of 
her voice.  </p>
<p>Peach hissed with pleasure. Her hand squeezed the closest, softest thing it could find as she 
rolled over what appeared to be near-climax. That soft, close thing just happened to be Olena's 
S cup breast, causing the girl on the sidelines of this familial conflict to wince before melting into 
her carnal fulfillment. The titty tingles came back with a vengeance. After just having 
disappeared, Peachy's touch awakened them at an alarming speed.  </p>
<p>Just one touch from her. . . I feel like I'm melting. </p>
<p>"Mmm! Mhhh, Nicole! Quit it. Limey, get over here with that drink! For the love of all that's 
twisted, give this girl her drink!" </p>
<p>On command, yet another gorgeous woman approached. Olena spied through the hooded lids 
of her eyes, still loving how Peachy was using the moment to grope her.  </p>
<p>For no other reason than body type, she assumed that this third woman was related to the two 
sisters.  </p>
<p>Nicole and Peach sported tall, proud builds which the third girl contrasted with a stalkier frame. 
Youth defied their maturity, too; a gentle peace that exuded from her five feet of height. The 
third relative sported a third hairstyle: lavender purple sheets spread down over her neck, 
around her shoulders like a cape, and down to the backs of her thighs in a single flag. 
Juxtaposed were emerald green eyes, giving the name 'Limey' its appropriate context.  </p>
<p>Then, of course, were the curves. Had Olena hastefully sipped any of Peach's drink, her 
alcohol-slacked inhibitions would have sent her tripping all over herself to get into the new girl's 
arms. Never had she encountered anything with remotely the same cuddle appeal as the new 
woman. Her thighs were juicy and full from what could be seen of her leggings. They were 
partially covered by an oversized, hooded black sweater that read 'hashtag prayer life' across 
the front.  </p>
<p>Well, as best as Olena could read. The newest girl trounced the other two in size. She even 
eclipsed Olena. A fun-sized, cuddlesome stuffed animal of a girl had boobs that guarded her 
thighs and jiggled nearly two feet in front of her. </p>
<p>Fuck, I need to touch those. I need to just feel her against me—those huge titties squishing into 
mine. I want to spend a cold winter night with this angel. </p>
<p>"And you didn't relieve yourself before coming out? Limey, you're the responsible one," Nicole 
whined.  </p>
<p>The purple-haired girl's shoulders folded forward and down, aware of her mistake but not 
completely subjective to her sister's forces. "I was on my way to do just that when I saw Peach 
getting a drink. She said you were sending her on an errand and I decided to help. It's rare that 
you ask us for help on Christmas; it sounded important." Limey's hands appeared from behind 
her back. In her mitten hands was a steamy beverage. "So I made sure to get exactly what you 
asked for." </p>
<p>The only drink Olena wanted at that moment was a long, delicious swallow of Limey's entirety.  </p>
<p>She did so, but accepted the cider as well; sort of a consolation prize. Crazy, sure, but just 
looking at the girl made her even warmer than the drink in her hand—than any drink ever could. 
The mood was so potent that she could feel how fast her arms were moving to reach for her 
drink and purposefully slowed them down. She wanted to savor the moments; time she spent 
getting closer and closer to sweet, little Limey.  </p>
<p>Closer. Closer. Olena couldn't help it—she was being drawn in. Even if she could help it, she 
couldn't convince herself why she would. Her fingers reached—careful, tentative—and danced 
not-so-subtly over Limey's tiny hands. It had to have been a solid ten seconds before she 
realized that the two of them had been holding hands, suspending the beverage in the air 
between them. Limey was kindly smiling at her, eyes focused and sparkling; impressed, even 
flattered. </p>
<p>Olena jerked back and apologized.  </p>
<p>"Wow. My heart, gosh," Limey pressed her palms together and pulled her laced fingers toward 
her chest. It was easy to imagine that it meant she was smitten—or just surprised—but with her </p>
<p>little hands sinking into the cushiony barge of flesh, the gesture could only read as sexual. A 
tinkling sound chimed, cueing Olena into a golden chain around Limey's neck and a cross that 
she held tight between her fingers. "She's so sweet! Nicole, you're so lucky. I bet she snuggles 
well. . . Hey! You should come visit my church this Sunday. We have a really nice service with 
great singing and a coffee bar and—. . ." </p>
<p>Nicole closed in and squeezed Limey from behind. The smaller girl squealed. Having her 
shoulders hugged from above must have felt great.  </p>
<p>"There are reasons that you're my favorite, Lime. But Olena's mine, got it? Don't start any of that 
girlfriend stealing stuff like Peach," said Nicole. </p>
<p>Peach jumped to her feet. When she turned, a cart of full, rotund backside entered Olena's 
space. A tear in the jeans exposed an enticing left cheek. "Like me? Hell, I learned it from her! 
She's got a harem at her command, Nicole. Ha-rem. If one of us needs to be lectured on staying 
in our court, it's your 'favorite'." </p>
<p>"They're not a harem," Limey's lips puckered as she spoke defensively. "They're the sisterhood. 
We help one another and serve the community. Just this holiday season, we donated milk to 
orphanages to feed infants and toddlers without parents; it helped so many people. I think we 
stocked up eight or nine cities worth of orphanages, too." Limey puffed out her chest. It was like 
raising a sunken ship from the ocean as her boobs breached upward and sloshed melodically 
with the sound of, well, something. "And we do regular visits, too. The babies love the 
sisterhood. It's hard for foster parents to spend that quality skin-to-skin contact that kids need, 
and we're the best at it." </p>
<p>"Well isn't that nice. Nice and wholesome. How kind of you and your 'sisterhood'." Peach's eyes 
rolled like coins spilled from a purse. Sarcasm was painful and plain. "And Nicole spreads 
Christmas cheer because she just loves to help the helpless. . . right?" Peach placed a hand on 
a jutting hip. </p>
<p>"Exactly right," Nicole answered back, her tits serving as a lovely neck rest for Limey. </p>
<p>"Get a load of these two," Peachy turned back to Olena and pointed with a thumb toward her 
sisters. "They're so straight-laced. And I get it if that's what you're into. But you always have to 
be careful with girls like them. Always. They'll break your heart—I'm sure Nicole's already taken 
you farther than you wanted to go." </p>
<p>"Wh-what do you—. . ." Olena stammered. She didn't like how her situation was made to sound 
so predictable, but she listened anyhow because her feelings had never been given voice in this 
way. "What do you mean?" </p>
<p>"You shouldn't trust, understand? Make sure you do a gut check with everything. Nobody can be 
that jolly and perfect all the time." </p>
<p>Olena studied the drink in her hands. "S-so you think I shouldn't trust them?" </p>
<p>"I'm their sister. I know their good sides and their bad. The difference between them and me is 
that I'll just come out and say how I feel—no facades, no filters, no secrets. If I want to fuck you, </p>
<p>I'll say 'Olena, I want to fuck you'. But with them, and most people, it's different. What you ought 
to do is figure out if what you're getting is who they really are instead of who they want you to 
think they are. Got it, sweety?" </p>
<p>"Yea. I think you're right," Olena admitted, finally listening to her sense of unease when it came 
to Nicole. </p>
<p>But before she could do much else about it, Peach pulled her in by the back of her head and 
kissed her square on the lips. The collection of mouths she enjoyed ticked up by one, as the 
scorching flames of passion rolled into her wanting maw with just a simple sliver of intention 
from the rockstar sister. When it was done, the lingering taste of alcohol bit at Olena's lips. She 
was intoxicated for a completely different reason, however. </p>
<p>"Olena. I want to fuck you," Peach admitted, as simple as commenting on the weather. "If Nicole 
ever starts to bore you, just wish really hard and I'll come running." </p>
<p>"Goodbye, Peach!" Nicole barked.  </p>
<p>The punk girl erected herself and threw her palms into the air innocently. She took a step away 
but winked as she left. "As long as you keep her entertained you have nothing to worry about 
from me," she said and spun on her heel. "C'mon little Lime. I'll help get some of the extra juice 
out of you." </p>
<p>"Thanks!" Limey snuggled into Nicole's arm one more time before she left the sisterly touch for 
good. She went straight to Olena and tipped her head in a small bow. Even such a tiny gesture 
had her tits slapping at her knees. "It was a pleasure to meet you, Olena." </p>
<p>"Y-you too, L-Li—. . ." </p>
<p>"Liiiiimey." </p>
<p>"Limey." </p>
<p>"L-Limey. . ." </p>
<p>The younger girl's eyebrows rose and a startling sense that she knew way more than she'd 
been letting on chilled Olena's blood. "If you ever want to have a talk about life with boobs that 
seem larger than life, let me know. You aren't alone, not by a long shot, okay? The Sisterhood 
would be happy to help you." </p>
<p>Nicole butted in, ushering her youngest sister away by her shoulders. "Great job, missy. You 
went and broke her. Go on, get out of here. Take care of yourself." </p>
<p>"Enjoy the festivities!" Limey waved over her shoulder. As she walked away, there came a 
whole crowd of women that had done an amazing job of blending into the crowd. A shady 
entourage —one, then two, then suddenly half a dozen—surrounded the tiny girl; get led and 
followed and flanked on both sides by figures of taller, broader women in the cloth. Nuns? 
Priestesses?  </p>
<p>This should feel way weirder than it is. </p>
<p>"Is she really so big because she's full of—. . ." Olena started. </p>
<p>Nicole turned back and answered quickly. "Yes. It's kind of her thing." </p>
<p>"That's an interesting thing she's got," Olena muttered.  </p>
<p>"We all have interesting things. If there's anything you should have learned from all of that, it's 
that you too have an interesting 'thing' about you." </p>
<p>Nicole came around and started pushing the pads of her fingers into Olena's shoulder muscles. 
Her hands were practiced and knew exactly where to go with how much pressure to coax out 
the satisfying building of relaxation in Olena.  </p>
<p>Had she still felt the pressure and pull of her size affecting her, Olena knew that the relaxation 
and appreciation would have taken her over completely. That, and the ease with which Nicole 
had come behind her and started her public affections, were so utterly romantic. Every 
temptation was to sit quietly and sip the drink she'd just received.  </p>
<p>But Olena had done enough sitting and letting herself be subject to Nicole's vices.  </p>
<p>She stood and turned to face Nicole, whose hands were still cupped for a while after Olena 
retreated from beneath them.  </p>
<p>"Did I do something wrong?" Nicole asked.  </p>
<p>"Your sister Peach was right. I need to trust my gut," Olena answered, flatly. "And my gut says 
that I feel so amazing when I'm with you. It also says that I shouldn't trust you. So far, I've 
ignored the second part, but not anymore, okay?" Olena's hands were in fists, confrontational. A 
quick self-inventory and a long breath unrolled her fingers and brought a calm to her as she 
faced down this challenge. "You don't get my trust because you're great in bed. You have to 
earn it. I'm done giving it away for free, no matter how amazing Puzzlepalooza is." </p>
<p>Olena's speech ended and she spilled into the awkward silence that followed. Here she was 
with a festival being held in her honor, facing down the woman—goddess, magician, 
demon—who had made it possible, and she was making even more demands.  </p>
<p>She can't be of any harm. Look at her. Look at all she's done. You're crazy to distrust her.  </p>
<p>No. Jersey was right. Olena had been acting weirdly sexual. And Peach was right as well in her 
advice to trust her gut. Even Clarissa had some merit, as she posited the idea that maybe there 
was something off about how women who Olena was interested in also happened to be smitten 
by her, irrevocably.  </p>
<p>"Do you even want to trust me?" Nicole asked. She reached a hand across her chest and 
squeezed her opposite arm.  </p>
<p>"Yes. What kind of question is that—I'm infatuated by you," Olena confirmed. "Can we walk 
outside? Let's go." </p>
<p>"Your girlfriend is waiting in line for you, though."  </p>
<p>Olena took a step toward the slit in the tent anyway. "I'll text her, let her know where I am. And, 
according to your sisters, you're my girlfriend too." </p>
<p>————— </p>
<p>Olena took the lead for a while but found that many of the roads she had some familiarity with 
had been blockaded or otherwise obscured by traffic. When it was clear that her good faith 
efforts were getting her nowhere, Nicole took the lead again and found a quiet place in an open 
park off a side alley. Again, easily, like they'd done so a million times, Nicole took Olena's hand 
when the crowds grew thick and didn't let go when they arrived at what could only be described 
as half of a fifty-foot Christmas Tree.  </p>
<p>Nobody was allowed to be around. The construction crews were still at work assembling and 
decorating the tree for a lighting ceremony later on that evening. The park itself was empty 
except for the occasional worker who recognized Nicole and offered a quick wave. The rest 
didn't even look in their direction, occupied by work, just out of earshot. </p>
<p>Two bombshell beauties in their midst and the most the workers did was wave and nod in 
introduction? Just went to show how used the laborers had to have been with people that 
looked like Nicole—of people whose chests were as obtusely sized as Olena's. The tits these 
employees had seen while working for Nicole; the combined cup sizes had to have set some 
sort of record if added up.  </p>
<p>Nicole stood in a sunny spot near the tree. As she began to speak, a new section was added 
onto the large, pined tree and her face was swallowed up in a shadow. "How do I make you 
trust me?" </p>
<p>Straight to the point.  </p>
<p>"I don't know. The normal way?" </p>
<p>Nicole shrank some at that. There was some vulnerable corner of herself that she kept guarded. 
This conversation threatened it. "I don't mean to sound like that 'perfect girl' that never has to try 
in life—and saying so instantly makes me that girl." Nicole pinched her brow. A bumpy, sallow 
inhale hissed through her lips. "But I've never really had to earn people's trust. People tend to 
think that I'm a trustworthy person." </p>
<p>Olena had to suppress the urge to be dejected by such a sentiment. The feeling wasn't 
tenacious, so she knew not to trust it. "It makes sense. Look at all you do for people. You came 
back to your home town and gave it a Christmas like we haven't had—ever. And even though I 
haven't been the happiest with what you've done to my body, I'm pretty sure there are a few 
women out there who are appreciating the, uh, augmentations." </p>
<p>"But it's not enough for you?" Nicole raised her chin. "It's not enough. I have to do more to earn 
your trust." </p>
<p>"I guess." </p>
<p>"You guess?" Something ticked under Nicole's eye; a barely-there twitch. "As in, you don't 
know." </p>
<p>"I know. I just can't put it into words well. I'm sorry." </p>
<p>"So I don't know what else to do and you don't know what to tell me to do. Productive." </p>
<p>Olena's face scrunched up. "So is this the dark side Peach was talking about? All grumpy?" </p>
<p>"I can be a grinch sometimes, yea. But only when things aren't clear. Like this. It's unclear." </p>
<p>They both dissolved into another brief silence. Guys shouted back and forth, from crane to 
crane, from crane carriage to the groups on the ground with rope, pulling the ornaments and 
branches into place. They were hard at work, sweating to finish up what they would have likely 
planned to do over several days.  </p>
<p>"Are those your employees?" Olena asked. "I assumed they were." </p>
<p>"By extension, yes. I didn't hire them all. I have people for that." </p>
<p>"How rich are you, anyway? And can money buy magical powers? Is there a black magic shop 
or something?" </p>
<p>Titters cracked Nicole's frustration and she smiled. "Less rich than you think, for starters. Just 
well-connected." </p>
<p>"To a bank vault?" </p>
<p>"To very resourceful people." </p>
<p>Olena felt a pang and spoke on it instead of covering it for the sake of convenience or lust or 
awkwardness. "I really dislike when you aren't completely honest with me. It would have been 
so easy to give a straight answer. The only time I've heard anything about you is when I forced it 
out of you by the threat of leaving your hotel suite. I don't think it's fair that you know all about 
me but I know so little about you." </p>
<p>"It would be," Nicole started, unfolding her arms as she took a step into a beam of light, cracking 
through pine straw in the tree from behind. "Very difficult to be completely honest with you. For 
me, at least. I keep my personal life very close to my chest. The inner workings of my life are 
something to be protected." </p>
<p>"So you want me to take a step into your personal life, a life that you guard from me—like I 
might, I don't know, harm it. But I don't get to know what your personal life is about? I have to </p>
<p>take it on faith and step into the abyss for you? I don't care how much you've done for me and 
Bristlebank, that just isn't fair." </p>
<p>"Well. . ." Nicole kicked at some gravel in a way that would absolutely leave dust or mark on her 
low-top boots. "Okay, I'll play by your rules. I've never had to do this before—like I said, people 
are usually really easy for me—but if I must, then I will." </p>
<p>It was Olena's time to cross her arms. It meant fighting an overflowing amount of her own soft 
flesh just to complete the motion, but she didn't let that deter her. "Don't make it sound like you 
have to answer my questions to sleep with me. I'm already trying way too hard just to stand my 
ground right now. Wait. Is that you? That yearning that keeps calling to me?" By the end of the 
sentence, Olena was breathless. </p>
<p>"Yes and no." Nicole seemed perfectly content to leave it at that. Olena growled, so she went 
on. "Magic makes it so that we both get what we want. You want me to answer your questions, 
which is why I'm bending my normal rules for you. I want you to love me, but love is a tricky 
thing anyway. Magic can't exactly make a person love someone, but it can encourage the next 
best thing." </p>
<p>"Sex." </p>
<p>Nicole's head dipped; half a nod. </p>
<p>"Who makes these rules for magic? They sound like a sex addict." </p>
<p>"They aren't rules. Nobody made them. All I know is how things work. That's all I can tell you: 
what I know about what works. I didn't study from a spellbook or anything." Nicole stood tall, 
ready to face the brunt of her questioning as she faced the rest of her life: with confidence and 
tact. "I'll tell you what works. I'll do it because you mean the world to me. So ask away, beloved." </p>
<p>————— </p>
<p>"How rich are you—how do you get so rich?" </p>
<p>Nicole nodded like the act would pull the words from her locked jaw so she wouldn't have to do 
so herself. "Most of my early money came from quid pro quo arrangements. Using magic, I was 
able to give people the things they wanted: money, love, sex, power. Once we both figured out 
that I was the 'good luck charm', as some crudely put it, they started reciprocating with favors of 
their own. I ended up running into all sorts of people that helped me manage and fund my life. I 
do all I can with those resources and pay others to accomplish things that I can't on my own; 
larger projects that take several managers, someone to handle hiring, someone to coordinate. 
They do the rough stuff, mostly. I stick to what I'm best at." </p>
<p>Olena tried rephrasing with the first thing to come to mind. "Like Santa. He has his elves that 
make the toys and tend to the workshop and he just does the important stuff every so often." </p>
<p>"Yes. He does." </p>
<p>Olena blinked. "Am I missing something?" </p>
<p>"Ask your next question." </p>
<p>"That was a question, wasn't it? What have I been missing? Tell me exactly what you're hiding 
right now, Nicole." </p>
<p>Nicole recoiled. Her body language read 'cornered', like a cold cat an alley, like a child being 
scolded one time too many by an oppressive parent. It was enough to make Olena regret asking 
the question at all, and yet she knew there could never be anything between them if she didn't 
get this one answer. Somehow, everything seemed to ride on it.  </p>
<p>"Olena. . ." </p>
<p>"Please?" Olena chirped. "I won't use what you give me to hurt you. I haven't yet, have I?" </p>
<p>"My sisters and I all have our special domains. It's the areas within which we can use our magic. 
I'm sure you noticed Limey's powers—actually, I'm certain you did. Your heart was, well, honest 
about how much you liked the idea of milky breasts—. . ." </p>
<p>"Answer the damned question." </p>
<p>"Santa. He's the guy that gives gifts on Christmas, right? What's another name for Santa? Saint 
Nicolas, yea?" Nicole nodded, like everything she said made perfect sense. "Saint Nicholas. 
Saint Nick. Peach called me 'Nicky'." </p>
<p>It didn't click for Olena right away. The claim being made was so absurd, her mind had trouble 
connecting the logic as it was being presented. It wasn't until Nicole finished—that she ran her 
fingers through her hair with utter embarrassment—that Olena realized that the woman who had 
seemed so mythical and magical had a reason to be.  </p>
<p>Olena breathed in deep, then said in a loud voice, "You're Santa!" </p>
<p>Chapter 7 
Jolly Ole Saint Nicole 
Word Count: 6675 </p>
<p>All
 the workers froze.<br />
​</p>
<p>After mostly ignoring the couple’s conversation, it seemed that anyone in reasonable range of 
Olena’s declaration were now attending to nothing else; not the Christmas Tree, the ornaments, 
or any other decorations. </p>
<p>Time froze. The way dolls might jerk their heads in a horror movie toward a haunted intruder 
was how every person in the park now regarded Olena. She shrivelled in response; made small 
under countless eyes—the crane workers, the decorators, the truck drivers, the people 
reviewing a spreadsheet on a tablet, the men using dollies to move heavy boxes.  </p>
<p>Nicole spoke as if unbothered by the imminent inquisition. “Um, so I am and I'm not the Santa 
 Saint Nicky, like, Saint Nick. But I’m not a fat guy that breaks into your house 
am
you know. I 
​
once a year.” </p>
<p>Olena’s voice shrank along with everything else. “B-But you have unlimited resources. And you 
give people wh-what they want. That’s Santa stuff—y-you’re Santa!” Olena squeezed her entire 
forehead with her right hand, struck with a realization. “God, I had sex with Santa. But can I 
have sex with a fictional character? I don't believe in Santa. Nobody does. That's just silly—and 
why is everyone watching us. Nicole. . .” The words all sped up till they came out mousy. 
Olena’s chin sank into her neck; defensive, fearful. </p>
<p>She noticed Nicole had a hand on her hip, pouting. She asked what was the matter. "I'm not a 
fictional character. I'm right here. And it isn't 
 to believe in me." She cleared her throat with a 
silly
​
single, polite cough and constructed her impervious persona all over again. Had she just taken 
offense at Olena’s words? "And they’re watching us because disclosing Santa’s actual identity 
in a public and </p>
<p>"Oh. Sorry. I, just. . .”   </p>
<p>Nicole waved a hand; looked to her left and right at all the people now gawking at them. “We’re 
good here. She can be trusted. Back to work with you all.” </p>
<p>Just like that, the workers resumed their tasks with shrugs of disregard.  </p>
<p>Nicole approached Olena, seeing that her mind was boggled into raw, hazy emotion.  </p>
<p>Olena realized vaguely that the sanity she’d sought to preserve all along was being threatened 
by Nicole’s intimacy, but just couldn’t bring herself to do anything about it. Bombs went off in her 
emotions. Utter chaos and war in her limbs. Her stomach seemed to twist like her utter 
bafflement with her life were two hands wringing it out.  </p>
<p>And yet, she froze. Her stand for herself wavered. She had resolved herself against many deep, 
dark secrets and nothing in her strength had prepared her to hear that Nicole was actually 
Santa. </p>
<p>way isn’t the best idea.” 
loud
​</p>
<p>​
​
​
 
Who could ever be prepared for that?! </p>
<p>Nicole spoke once her arms were around Olena. Olena’s yellow sweater stuck out like a flimsy 
plastic grocery bag filled with overripe melons meaning Nicole had to approach from the side 
and hold Olena’s shoulders. “If it makes you feel better to think of everyone here as my ‘elves’, 
you’re welcome to. It tends to help people. Most just simplify things to match the mythology 
anyway. Doesn’t bother me.” </p>
<p>“Help people? So I’m not the only one who knows?” </p>
<p>“You, Jane, Peachy, Limey, my other sisters; a few others, like these workers.” </p>
<p>“Wh-what else about the myth is true? Like, what Santa stuff.” It did feel good to at least have a 
reference for everything. Nicole had thrown her a life ring. She didn’t even have to ask for it. </p>
<p>“I keep a list of the things people want, but it’s mostly for organization. After you grant a few 
thousand people’s deepest desires, some of them start to blend in together. Money, power, 
acceptance, love; universal stuff. I also like milk and cookies.” She paused to see if Olena would 
react. It was small and hesitant given her emotional state, but a smile presented itself. “Oh, and 
I have an awesome red coat that I had taylored—it’s really cute. I’ll have to show it to you 
sometime.” </p>
<p>“How about reindeer? And a sleigh?” Olena was almost fanatical when she said it due to the 
immense amount of cognitive dissonance wreaking havoc on her mind. “And seeing people 
when they’re sleeping. And when they’re awake, too.” </p>
<p>“I’m actually not an animal person. No reindeer. I do have a sleigh, but it’s not what you think at 
all; exclusively for recreational activities. I have a house up north where it snows.” </p>
<p>“The north pole?!” </p>
<p>“Someone’s excited.” </p>
<p>Olena was way beyond excited—there was something shamefully exciting about what she was 
learning. It had burst out of her, shattering the dark, icy shadows of disbelief. Sure, her girthy 
discomforts floated around inside her like gloomy glaciers, but the kid in her—that which 
treasured Christmas more than anything—was a formidable, sunny lance. It started to carve 
through as she heard about Nicole’s being a real-life sort of Santa Clause. </p>
<p>“For the record, I do not believe you. I absolutely don’t. It’s insulting that you would think that 
you could convince me to trust you with something as dumb as claiming to be Santa Claus. I’d 
have to be a child to believe you. I’d have to be crazy. I’d have to be delusional and gullible and </p>
<p>wrong. . .” Olena bobbed her head back and forth, trying to sort herself out without letting her 
emotions overwhelm her. “And yet, I just can’t help but believe you. . .” </p>
<p>“Why?” </p>
<p>Olena checked her feelings; her heart, her gut, and any other internal organs that felt like 
chiming in. “Because I think you’re being honest. I don’t think you’re hiding anything—you really 
love cookies and have a sleigh and keep your life organized. I think that red coat of yours really 
exists and that you have a house at the north pole.” </p>
<p>“It’s an Alaskan Resort Home. I spend a few months there to unwind. It isn’t at the north pole. 
Nothing is at the north pole except water.” Nicole explained, nodding along because what she 
described was her reality.  </p>
<p>“A few months like. . . December?” </p>
<p>“Hell. No. Alaska’s cold in the winter—I’d have to be crazy.” </p>
<p>Olena thought about it and concurred. It had to be oppressively cold that far north in the winter 
time. “There’s another reason I think I believe you: there just isn’t any other way to explain 
where my body came from.” She tasted the words; decided they were important enough to 
speak again. “Maybe that’s it—that question. Nicole, did you change my body?” </p>
<p>Nicole sought out comfier and comfier parts of Olena, becoming even touchier since her desire 
to be physical wasn’t being denied. “I did.” Her touch drifted lower, not quite on Olena’s breasts 
but just above them. She flirted with the idea, pretended like the thin strip of sweater just south 
of the collarbone was the sexiest thing in the world.  </p>
<p>“Does the spell work the way I think it works?” </p>
<p>“The more time you spend around holiday things—trees, sweaters, reindeer—the bigger you 
get. It’s also worse when you’re horny, by the way. I don’t know if you noticed.” </p>
<p>“Oh, I noticed,” Olena said, weakly shrugging to adjust Nicole’s arms around her. “I also noticed 
that part of the magic is actually 
 me horny. And it’s making all these girls fall in love with 
making
​
me. That’s not so bad. . . but it's still weird. And impossible. Like the rest of this.” </p>
<p>Nicole was all but sliding her palm over Olena’s swollen, sweater-held breasts. She took a step 
back at her question, though, and really looked the Russian girl over. “Your wish was complex. I 
couldn’t sum it up with one easy word—you didn’t just wish for, say, money. But from the very 
start of the holidays, you were wishing for an open, nonmonogamous relationship and to have 
plenty of super satisfying sex. So when I used my powers on you, that’s what you got; taking the 
forms you just mentioned.” Nicole’s stepping away involved her pulling Olena toward the street </p>
<p>​
by the hand. “Aren’t you tired of asking questions? You know everything about me. You can 
trust me. Please, I’ve waited so long. I need you.” </p>
<p>Olena heard the pang of raw exposure in the plea. Worse, she felt her own nethers beginning to 
weep. Standing in the shade of a giant balsam fir had a way of making her want to strip 
naked—worse than tingles with no context or arousal with no object. The urge coursing within 
her now had direction and intention. She was ready to go at it. That couldn’t be denied. </p>
<p>“I need you too,” said Olena. “I need you like I’ve never needed anybody else.” </p>
<p>“Then let’s go. I’m reserving a conference room in the old city hall building—. . .” </p>
<p>Nicole had Olena nearly to the street Olena stopped them. She walked on her heels, showing a 
final resistance. “There’s one last thing.” One last important thing. </p>
<p>“Love. . .” </p>
<p>“I do want you. And you want me. But since I’m being affected by your magic, how am I 
supposed to know how much of any of this is real?” Olena’s hand dropped to her side; notably, 
not her breasts. “How do I know if you love me for me? Or if by this time in—I don’t know—July, 
when your Christmas powers are weaker, we’ll fall out of love and you’ll just toss me to the side. 
Don’t get me wrong, I think you’re hot and all. Just. . .” </p>
<p>The question she hadn’t known she wanted an answer to was in the air, hanging between them 
like a giant, lead ornament.  </p>
<p>Nicole sucked on her teeth till her lip curled up and into her mouth. Hurt dragged her 
countenance down. It made Olena question herself; wonder if all her questions really needed 
answers—wonder if the way she’d worded things was exactly right.  </p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I made you sound really evil, then. I didn’t mean—. . . ” </p>
<p>Nicole didn’t run. Olena knew that. She’d never seen her in a hurry for anything. A determined 
strutt, maybe, but never had Nicole been hard pressed to sprint. It just wasn’t who she was.  </p>
<p>But Nicole lost all her airs, then. She fled away from the street and into Olena’s arms for a 
sweeping, romantic kiss. Olena’s body lit up at once. Her womanhood gripped at nothing, her 
stomach flipped itself into a knot. Her tongue slithered up and out of her mouth, building a nest 
in the dark, seductive lands just beyond Nicole’s lips. Something just seemed to connect inside 
the both of them that hadn’t until then. </p>
<p>Olena’s breasts bustled with newness and she felt her body’s trademark shifting. “Bigger—I-I’m 
growing again. Nicole.” It took her everything to break their kiss to talk, but her tits just seemed 
more pressing.  </p>
<p>Nicole whispered as she pressed their bodies closer together; more so surrounding herself with 
Olena’s overflowing body. “No, it’s something else that you wished for.” </p>
<p>“Something else? But what else did I—. . .” </p>
<p>“Olena?” </p>
<p>“Yea?” </p>
<p>Nicole pulled back, her silver hair whipping around on a speedy gust of air. Her skin was flushed 
with hot desire; lips looked so full and juicy like they just might be growing as well. It was 
enough of an image for Olena to remember their first meeting nearly a month ago. When they 
first met, it seemed impossible to have such a hot woman that was so open about talking to her. 
Now, here they were, smooching at the mouth of an alley just before Christmas. </p>
<p>So much had changed. So much of the impossible was happening.  </p>
<p>Nicole closed her eyes. Tension rose over her face. She squeezed their bodies tighter, the wind 
swirling all the faster. It didn’t feel like a normal winter breeze.  </p>
<p>“What’s going on—. . .” Olena began, but in the twinkling of an eye, the two disappeared without 
a trace. </p>
<p>In their wake, the swirl of wind slowed till it disappeared. </p>
<p>————— </p>
<p>She was warm. She felt no more wind. She smelled some sweet thing brewing and felt that the 
ground had a give to it. Concrete wasn’t supposed to have give to it. What street was she on 
that was warm and soft? Her eyes were slow to adjust. They hadn’t kept up. It was, oddly, the 
smell of Nicole and the sense that her silver-haired crush was nearby that snapped her into her 
new present.  </p>
<p>“Holy! The hell, Nicole!?” Olena jumped back but not enough to break away. “We just showed 
up in your hotel suite.” </p>
<p>Nicole bopped her head to the side as if to say ‘Guess we did’ with just a gesture. “The stories 
say Santa comes down chimneys. That isn’t exactly true. People just know he doesn’t come 
through the front door, and the chimney thing just happened to catch on. Really, I can appear </p>
<p>wherever I’m wanted. And since most kids want to see Santa, it makes my job a little easier.” 
The silver-haired being of myth made a sound of exasperation and fell backward. A bed was 
there to catch her, recently made, with a chocolate on one of the many pillows from the hotel 
staff that bounced off and rolled across the. “This one kind of took it out of me. I had to find a 
desire in you to be somewhere private with me.” </p>
<p>Olena touched her chin, thinking. “I’m sure I’ve been wanting to get to a private place with you 
for a while.”  </p>
<p>“For different reasons: to ask more questions or to get away from my ‘elves’. I didn’t want to use 
those. I wanted you to want to be here with me because you trusted me. You do, a little bit, 
right?” </p>
<p>Olena found nothing wrong with trusting a ‘little bit’ and nodded.  </p>
<p>“And us doing the tongue tango makes finding your desires way harder than it sounds. 
Everything rational about you basically melted away. It’s like finding which scoop of ice cream is 
mine in a tub of melted ice cream.” </p>
<p>Olena scowled. “And whose fault is that, exactly? I didn’t 
blank.” </p>
<p>Nicole huffed, sighing happily. “Mine. Sorry, sweety. You’re irresistible to me.” </p>
<p>Olena looked around some. She still couldn’t quite believe herself to be across town, about half 
an hour away by car. It had happened in the space of time it took to blink. Remembrance of any 
transition—she didn’t know what she expected, but maybe some psychedelic, wormhole 
oddness would have been justifiable—came up empty. And yet she saw the vast master 
bedroom with modern, wooden vanity and the stretch of gray sky beyond a sliding glass 
window. The door to the bathroom was ajar and she recalled vaguely that it was there the last 
time she was in the room.  </p>
<p>The last time you were here, you had the time of your life. . . </p>
<p>“Are we here to, well, y’know?” Olena whispered. Her insides were so conflicted that she was 
almost fine with just letting Nicole decide what they did. Her moment of serious resolve was 
over. It had exhausted her. The most she gained from it was knowledge that Santa Claus was 
real and that she still wanted to smother Nicole under her massive size.  </p>
<p>That size continued enlarging by the second, too. In fact, it really began when Olena started to 
accept that she had met Santa and that Nicole was the embodiment of all things Christmas.  </p>

​</p>
<p>Nicole, weary from warping several miles away with Olena 
across space and time had to be burdensome with extra baggage, didn’t it?—slouched further 
back, ready to recline. She extended her hand to Olena. “We’re here to do what we’ve needed 
to since the day we met.” </p>
<p>Olena took the hand and fell; conforming to Nicole's grasp. She felt herself spreading atop her 
lover. Her body opened and yielded, going warm as it melted atop Nicole's voluptuous swells. It 
impressed Olena how her tits transmitted the slightest bulges in Nicole, how she was able to tell 
with startling clarity the size of her lover’s breasts and the pinch of her waist. It was almost as 
good as using her hands; some new booby sense that wasn’t even blurred by her clothing.  </p>
<p>The sensitivity of her tits had been a curse to her in the past. In this moment, though, they 
added a new layer to how she wanted to use them. </p>
<p>They did, for a while. She let Nicole catch her breath and used what she had to bring the wilting 
woman to her energetic peak. Her lips caressed, mining muscles of their tension with her 
tongue and getting to taste Nicole’s skin; down her neck, behind her ear. Best of all was the use 
of her growing bust. At their size now, she could tell that growth was slower and harder to 
measure. And yet, every time she would push off or lay down or squeeze herself tighter against 
Nicole, the sensation of her softest skin going over and around such a beautiful woman called to 
a familiar, subconscious part of her that was so, so happy to have so much titty to offer. She 
was a blanket. Her chest could massage. Fitting Nicole between her mammaries satisfied a 
nurturing part of her she always knew she had.  </p>
<p>And when she did, she felt herself getting that little big bigger. It was a self-fulfilled loop: she 
grew larger, felt amazing about being huge, indulged in how good it felt to use her giant 
boobies, and grew as a result of those good feelings.  </p>
<p>Quickly, Nicole bounced back. The tiredness had been shallow—her entire reason for warping 
them to a hotel in the first place was much stronger than any kind of weakness.   </p>
<p>But she surprised Olena with one, final question. “Olena,” Nicole said, low enough to be a croak.  </p>
<p>Their closeness allowed Olena to hear the quiet tune of a whisper. “Yes?” </p>
<p>“One more thing.” </p>
<p>“Sure, Nicole.” </p>
<p>”You asked how you could know if it was really love or magic? Well, that’s the hardest thing 
you’ve asked thus far. I don’t have a way of knowing that.” Nicole’s arms wrapped protective 
around Olena like she could somehow shield her partner from the blow of her words. “That’s the </p>

​</p>
<p>scary part about magic. It just works. I’m not any better at determining its impact than anyone 
else. Is what we have unique? Would it have happened eventually? </p>
<p>“Then how can you be so certain? You always know who should be in your life—that’s what you 
told me before when we were here. So, how can you know that? Not think it—
it?” Olena 
know 
​
hadn’t realized it but a part of her was screaming. Her voice rose and rose despite remaining 
quiet and low. It wasn’t until Nicole squeezed her into a hug and dug her forehead into Olena’s 
neck that the young Russian knew how badly she needed the certainty. “This has moved so 
fast, Nicole. It’s too much for anyone. And you’re asking it of </p>
<p>Me: with every reason to turn it down, with every reason not to trust, and with every reason to 
be suspicious. Why can’t Nicole see how hard it is? </p>
<p>After trailing off, the two held one another through the emotional turmoil—which seemed so far 
gone, but had lingered, unaddressed, long enough for them to retreat into the comfort of sex. 
Minutes later, clarity came. And since grief and confusion had left a wake behind it, the two 
could converse without imminent fear of bursting into tears.  </p>
<p>“This is how I look at it,” Nicole started again, at last. “Imagine two people who are perfect for 
one another. They meet on any given day. All sorts of things could get in the way of their 
meeting, right? One or both of them are busy. Maybe they’re too nervous to speak to one 
another so they pretend to be busier than they are. Or maybe they think ‘If it’s meant to be, then 
we’ll see eachother again’. They could be sitting in the same room as the person who will 
complete their life, but never act on their feelings for any of these reasons. Then they leave, and 
whatever relationship they could have had is lost. They never see each other again. Or, even if 
they do cross paths at another time, they’ll be different people with even more in the way. That’s 
a waste, right?“ </p>
<p>Olena nodded, nose digging into Nicole’s silky hair.  </p>
<p>“Well, what if they happened to meet on Christmas instead of ‘any given day’? The mood is 
right, their hearts are open, and it’s the perfect time to make their relationship happen. The extra 
nudge they needed is there and they meet and it’s all gooey and perfect.” Nicole twiddled her 
fingers like sparks were about to appear on her finger tips. “The two are together because they 
just so happened to cross paths on the right day.” </p>
<p>“That’s very lucky for them, then,” Olena answered. </p>
<p>“Not lucky, Olena. It’s not luck—Christmas doesn’t just happen. People put up lights and buy 
presents. Companies make the choice to close their doors and give their employees time off. It’s 
a societal effort—bunches of people pull together to make that magical moment—the perfect 
environment for feeling closer to people than any other time of year. And that’s magic, Olena. </p>
<p>​
​
The holidays are magic. And you know it—it’s why you love the holidays. I’ve felt that from you 
before.” </p>
<p>Olena did love the holidays, so much so that she had pushed herself to go see her family even 
when she knew it would end catastrophically. She didn’t mind the busy lines at the Crafty 
Shack. She loved the peppermint mochas and the warm sweaters. All of it was special to her. </p>
<p>Most recently, she loved her new body. When they didn’t feel like lecherous sacks of girlish 
weight, they did seem to flatter her. It was the best Christmas present she knew she wanted, but 
not in the way she expected.  </p>
<p>“But they still can’t know, can they?” Olena asked. Her voice had gone raw; airy, light as fresh 
snow.  </p>
<p>“They can’t know if it was Christmas or magic or anybody else that brought them together, 
Olena. Neither can we—that’s the point. We could have met on a bus or on vacation in another 
country or in the bathroom. Maybe, without magic, we wouldn’t be as close as we are. Maybe 
we’d be closer without it. Maybe, maybe, maybe. All I know is this,” Nicole pushed up and 
kissed Olena with so much fire it threatened to singe their eyelashes. “That silly day in 
November, I walked into the Crafty Shack to show my face and see what one of my sponsored 
businesses looked like. I saw you. We chatted. And when I walked away, I knew that I didn’t 
want us to end up like the perfect couple on ‘any given day’. I couldn’t live with the regret—I had 
to try and make Black Friday like the holidays in whatever way I could. I would never forgive 
myself if I never tried for you, Olena. That’s magic, that’s luck. That’s. . . love.” </p>
<p>“Nicole. . .” </p>
<p>“Olena.” </p>
<p>I don’t want to let this chance go by either. </p>
<p>Time fled the room to watch from afar while the two became one among fresh sheets.  </p>
<p>Olena sank and sank, amused and aroused when Nicole could accept her all. The totality of her 
body just seemed like so much to her, but she loved how Nicole made her feel tamed, small, 
and cute.  </p>
<p>“Clothes off. Let’s see our handiwork,” Nicole said, panting from the shortness of breath.  </p>
<p>Olena’s mind went flowy. Her eyes were dreary as if she’d just been asleep. The opposite was 
the case, though, as she rolled and pushed onto her knees. Just kissing had invigorated her. In 
fact, her body felt like it was glowing with energy. Her core felt molten and each breast moved 
with an impossible sense of swirling.  </p>
<p>She was so unbelievably horny! Energy that had been partitioned off was now being tapped into 
as the prospect of sex presented itself.  </p>
<p>“I’ll need help,” Olena said, hands in fists at the hem of her sweater. “This won’t come off 
without a fight. And I think I’m still getting bigger. . .” </p>
<p>“I could just wiggle my nose and poof it off of you,” Nicole raised an eyebrow. “I’d enjoy seeing 
that.”  </p>
<p>“But then you wouldn’t get to enjoy the effort of taking my top off,” answered Olena. “Wait, 
wiggling your nose strips people? I don’t remember that from any Christmas stories.” </p>
<p>“True. It only strips people bigger than a P cup. Very exclusive power.” Nicole came across the 
bed on all fours, hips gyrating as she went. “But you’re right again. I’d much rather go mano a 
mano with that awful booby prison.” </p>
<p>“Some things just do better with hands and determination,” Olena bobbed her head back and 
forth as she spoke. A groan crackled in her throat just after. “My dad used to say that to us—the 
Russian equivalent of it. I can’t believe I’m using his lines while I’m taking my clothes off.” She 
couldn’t believe that she’d somehow overcome the emotion that came with her father, too. Her 
Christmas Eve disaster had been just a few hours ago. Now, she was boldly forging this new 
path with Nicole, trusting her with her body and heart. </p>
<p>“I’d like to meet him in person on day,” Nicole said. “He seems like a nice guy. Little 
conservative, but not impossible to change. And funny at times, too, with that accent. Now, off 
with that shirt—” </p>
<p>“Whoa, whoa whoa. . . You know my dad? How would you know my dad?” </p>
<p>Nicole started sliding her own boobs up and down against Olena’s colossal funbags. If the sight 
wasn’t enough to raise her heart rate, the sensation loving softness traipsing up Olena’s nipples 
instantly jolted her tender folds. “Are we still asking questions? I mean, I’ll answer but I’d prefer 
to see your full, curvy, unparalleled body instead of talking about how I, Saint Nicole, happen to 
have some very generic information about your immigrant father.” </p>
<p>As bad as she took compliments, they were Olena’s weakness here. “Good point. On the ‘I’d 
rather show you my boobies’ part, not the ‘I use my Santa powers to learn about your family’ 
part.”  </p>
<p>“It’s out of love. I promise I’m not a creep.” </p>
<p>“Hmm. . .” </p>
<p>“I creep out of love.” </p>
<p>They laughed, cutting through the awkwardness with ease.  </p>
<p>Olena and Nicole fought with the sweater. They managed to bunch it up just below the lower 
swells so that thick bulbs of mammary jutted free. Nicole commented on how pretty Olena’s skin 
was; smooth to the touch and lightly scented. The start of disrobing her, all on its own, was 
plenty a reason for them to pause and make out again, during which Nicole filled and overfilled 
her hands and arms with Olena’s generous shelf of breast.  </p>
<p>They resumed again and, through a joined effort, struggled to force the sweater any higher than 
a third of the way up her inflated jugs. At their size, they easily filled the space of Nicole’s arms. 
It was as if she was carrying a pair of water-filled, forty-ounce garbage bags, but instead of 
being made of black, shiny plastic, they were wrapped in Olena’s incomparably clear skin and 
radiant with her body’s warmth.  </p>
<p>“You’re such a tease,” Nicole said, huffing from exertion. “And this sweater should be used to 
patch holes in the hulls of ships—it’s so damned strong.” </p>
<p>Olena craned her neck back, as Nicole had taken position behind her for leverage, and 
licked—actually licked—Nicole’s cheek. The move had no forethought and no plan. She meant 
nothing and everything by it. Her body had acted as it pleased, swept up in the moment 
because she now happily allowed herself to be. It just felt so awesome to have spent five or so 
minutes on getting her clothes off and not making any process because, well, she was a giant in 
the realm of feminine qualities now. It made her courageous and wild to realize this about 
herself. Olena giggled at the open-mouthed awe on Nicole’s face.  </p>
<p>“Sorry. You were just making the cutest face, all focused on trying to get this sweater off of me.”  </p>
<p>“God. . . I knew I wanted you. Top-heavy little vixen—I’ll tear this damned sweater right off, if 
you don’t behave,” Nicole growled, daring.  </p>
<p>“No you won’t. It’s too fun exposing my slowly,” Olena said.  </p>
<p>“I’m not above sacrificing one good time for another. Now, come here.” </p>
<p>Nicole cocked Olena back, her strong arms under Olena’s armpits; hands folded back like a 
wrestling lock. The act thrust Olena’s half moons up into the air, suspended pendulously by the 
belt of a sweater; that, and their own perkiness. The sweater nearly cut her tits in half. A top 
bulge and a bottom bulge escaped and her nipples—forever hard, attention seeking—were only 
barely covered. She was curled into the doggystyle, and Olena gasped at Nicole’s forceful 
command of the situation. </p>
<p>She felt her booty jiggling pleasantly while Nicole 
Fwap! Fwap! Fwap! 
​</p>
<p>Then, the older, silver-haired goddess ground her pelvis hard into Olena’s backside. With little in 
the way of a barrier, Olena’s pussy was wide open from behind and received a steady, rough 
pressure as Nicole slapped into her with her powerful hips.  </p>
<p>Olena groaned along. 
humped her. It was the most carnal thing she could imagine feeling. She felt so free in Nicole’s 
vice. There was nothing for her to do—nothing she could even imagine wanting to do—as her 
tender womanhood was slapped into again and again.  </p>
<p>Nicole peeled away Olena's heavy, wool leggings. The pounding improved. The R cup—really, 
S or even T cup—breasts launched into the air. They all but danced, carrying the ripple of the 
thrust with truth and brilliance. It was like Nicole slammed away for no other reason but to see 
Olena’s body react; to see the shockwaves barrelling through in rippling, yummy titty flesh. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Olena groaned. She had never heard such sounds come from herself before. Then 
again, nobody had fucked her like Nicole was doing—especially not men, who seemed to favor 
the doggy-styled position. Jersey hadn’t taken her from behind either. They never questioned 
whether or not the sex they had could be varied or altered to meet another, baser wanting. Then 
again, they had no reason to—sex between them was as fulfilling and passionate as any lesbian 
could ever want.  </p>
<p>Which was what Olena knew was so special; the reason she knew she couldn’t have just one 
woman. Each one brought something new to the table.  </p>
<p>Nicole kissed her as she went bottomless and groped the luscious pair of titties jiggling before 
her. For that brief break, Olena knew as true and real as anything else that she wanted Nicole 
and Jersey the same way. The two were so different and yet so perfect for her. Why should they 
be made to choose? Clarissa too—why should any woman have to choose to cut herself off 
when they could all be happy and joyous and loving and so, so, </p>
<p>“D-don’t stop,” Olena pleaded. “I’m close.” It was the view of her titties, which approached two 
feet of fluffy, bouncy distance from her petite frame, and the constant physical stimulation of her 
womanhood, that was driving her ever higher. </p>
<p>“N-Never, beautiful. . .” </p>
<p>Olena’s sweater pulled tighter against her. Nicole used the fabric like reins, letting Olena’s 
weight take her forward before pulling hard for a mighty whip. Nicole only paused so that she 
could go bottomless too, then restarted with doubled effort, the goal of a climax now in sight.  </p>
<p>sexually sated. 
so 
​</p>
<p>​
​
Once they were both bottomless, Olena felt the rapid fire jolts as her pussy took full-forced 
spanks from Nicole’s hips and thighs. Her hands had nothing to do, so she pulled them behind 
Nicole’s head so she could be pulled into a kiss while she was driven higher and higher.  </p>
<p>Her tits felt like they were about to erupt. With each hard yank of Nicole’s fists, she heard 
terrifying and exhilarating rips and tears; stitching being popped all over. It was like she was 
wearing a sweater made of bubble wrap. Being fucked popped those bubbles; five or ten at a 
time. Olena cried out. She felt coolness kissing where more of her breasts were being exposed. 
Trickles of sweat peeled down her body, escaping in tiny rivers around her huge knockers. The 
tearing, the fucking, the sweat. None of it was conducive to being clothed.  </p>
<p>And when her orgasm gushed from her trembling being, at that exact moment, Nicole tore the 
sweater clean off Olena’s buxom body from behind. Her pale moons rushed into the air, given 
levity by the carnal, heated acts that had set them free.  </p>
<p>The beautifully busty girl tumbled forward into the pillows of her own nude chest, panting 
erratically. They happened to all but swallow her. It was a great place to seek respite after a 
climax, as it turned out. And the thought of her act didn’t elude her: she just had a great orgasm 
and was now recuperating in the soft, welcoming embrace of her T cup titties. What an 
indulgent thought—just a month ago it couldn’t have been a reality.  </p>
<p>Olena was so lucky to be where she was—who she was. And she’d never felt lucky to be 
anywhere or anybody.  </p>
<p>When the stars of rapture hid themselves and the rest of the world came into clarity, she still felt 
the zing of her own pleasure in her bones. Nicole was dutifully taking advantage of her 
face-down-ass-up position to make out with her pulsing, flushed pussy.  </p>
<p>“L-Let’s change,” Olena purred, more out of obligation.  </p>
<p>Nicole’s tongue flourished again, definitely. “You taste even better than I imagined, though. . . 
And eating pussy is the reason for the season.” </p>
<p>“Change, you devil. I-I need you somewhere else.”Olena rolled her eyes (intentionally, since 
they’d already rolled back into her head for another reason entirely only moments earlier). </p>
<p>“Oh?” </p>
<p>Olena flipped over onto her back. No small feat, considering the size of her tits constituted the 
majority of her body weight. And despite not really considering if she would look sexy while 
doing it, she couldn’t help but see her breasts for what they are when she moved them: sloshing 
mattresses rolling over her body, crashing into one another, and settling into an inviting, fleshy </p>
<p>wobble. They threw shreds of yellow sweater to both sides of her, remnants of how she’d been 
fucked senseless and blown the outfit to bits with her growing planets. She giggled.  </p>
<p>But she also noted that the flesh that had seemed to ripple like liquid earlier had also gained a 
kind of form. In fact, it was odd to witness; what were once yielding boulders were now taking on 
a tautness.  </p>
<p>“Here. Come and feel. Don’t they seem like they’ve changed?” Olena asked, but her hands 
were already searching. Her skin felt latent with something. Still, her boobs were pliable, just 
changed in texture. She noticed it when she was in her throes, legs gone to jello after 
cumming—her face and shoulders didn’t sink as deep into her plushy boobies. “Yea, 
something’s definitely up. I noticed when I, well, face-planted into them.” </p>
<p>Nicole sat back on her haunches. Waited.  </p>
<p>“Well?” Olena said. </p>
<p>“I’m just admiring you playing with yourself. Cutest thing, really.” </p>
<p>Olena blushed. She blurted exactly what she was thinking. “Are you going to suck on my tits or 
not?” </p>
<p>Nicole giggled—it sounded like a field of butterflies taking flight and felt like warm 
sunbeams—and rumped over. “Your nipples are like soda cans. You’re asking a lot of me.” </p>
<p>Olena rolled her eyes. “Nothing I know you aren’t capable of handling.” Once her lover was 
near, she felt those nipples straightening. They weren’t quite soda cans in girth but their length, 
when truly excited by the prospect of being sucked, did reach quite a ways. It was about as long 
as a hand was from heel to the second bend of a middle finger. This fact was made clear once 
Nicole pressed her palm into the risen peak to test its straightness. “See? They feel different. 
Th-they feel a little full. . .” </p>
<p>“Oh?” Nicole shot Olena a devilish look. She was mounted on top of the younger woman, 
straddling her at the hips—as close as the walls of yummy flesh would allow. “You don’t say. I 
think they look perfect. Unless you’re referring to how I can feel your heartbeat in your tips 
here.” </p>
<p>The sensation of her left nipple being squeezed in Nicole’s soft hand made the Russian girl sigh 
in pleasure. “Do that again.” Olena was surprised before and didn’t get to feel the fullness of the 
motion. This time when her nipple was squeezed and gently twisted, she felt her whole body 
letting go of something. It felt amazing. “Mmm, that feels so good.” </p>
<p>“I figured it did. Your breasts are absolutely raging right now.” </p>
<p>With a little apprehension causing her to frown, Olena asked, “Is everything going to be alright? 
Do you know what’s wrong with me?” </p>
<p>“Maybe I do. It’s just, uh, just another wish of yours that I may be granting. . .” </p>
<p>Olena could have sworn she heard a deep swishing sound, like liquid being pushed through a 
funnel or the agitator working in a washing machine down the hall. Because of the grasp on her 
nipple sending pleasure coursing through her body, though, she didn’t pay it much attention. 
Still, a warmth was building in her huge titties. It made her skin light up in sensitivity, especially 
in her areola. Really, they were the part that felt the best—comparable to her nipples, even. She 
felt them plumping, puffing up. On her back, she saw them become distinct from the rest of her 
pale fleshy balloons, becoming true caps. They were pink and slim and beautiful—becoming 
even more so the more Nicole gave her firm, fun squeezes.  </p>
<p>“Mmm,” Olena purred. </p>
<p>“It’s good, yea? Not as explosive, I must admit. I sort of had in mind more of what we just 
finished doing,” Nicole said.  </p>
<p>Olena shook her head back and forth, hair flipping playfully. “We’ve got forever to do it that way. 
Just keep on with what you’re doing. They feel so good when you add a little twist to it.” </p>
<p>“You mean like this?” </p>
<p>“Mmm! Mmm, yea. Y-yea, that kind of twist. Damn, being so full feels so great. Why didn’t they 
feel like this before—feel like. . .” Olena’s voice failed her. The pleasure had mounted higher, 
distancing herself from articulate thought. And yet she felt something purposely coming toward 
her. It neared the surface of her thoughts, slow and ready. “N-no way. Nicole, tell me it isn’t like 
that—why would it ever be like that?” </p>
<p>The platinum silver woman braced herself against one of Olena’s stacky buoys. Her body 
spread itself over the boob, the opposite of before when Olena’s tits had swallowed her up. 
Now, they were taut like a trampoline’s skin. Given their size, they were supportive to lean on 
and warm like a sauna to the touch. “You know that song? The twelve days of Christmas?” </p>
<p>“Y-yes. Of course. What does that have to do with. . . O-oh, good grief. Mmm, it’s coming.” </p>
<p>Nicole, flippantly, teasingly, began to hum the tune to the song. Her voice wasn’t perfect—a 
shocker, since the rest of her was—but she could carry the tune while her whole arms went into 
pumping Olena’s thick, juicy nipples. To keep from chafing, she incorporated her silky tongue 
and the lube let her squeeze just that extra bit harder; glide the erotic rods with a quickened 
rated.  </p>
<p>do

​</p>
<p>do it. This is too

​</p>
<p>“God. O-oh god. Nicole, th-that’s it—do it. Harder, faster. W-wait—

<p>Nicole broke in with the lyrics to her song. “Ten lords a-leaping, nine ladies dancing,” she sang. 
The notes slowed and turned to powdery, soft snow and at last she whispered the verse she’d 
been leading to: “Eight maids a-milking.” </p>
<p>Chapter 8 
Eight Maids Still Milking 
Word Count: 4774 </p>
<p>Sparkling
 in the lights above went stream after stream of white liquid. Olena’s tits violently 
​
ejected their stored contents, throwing their rivers of cream high enough to reach the luxury 
fifteen-foot ceiling. Her areola were a gorgeous shade of rose red and inflamed all the more as 
her sweet milk at last found a place to go. </p>
<p>Olena gawked. Her body had rendered her with nothing left to say—which was the norm, now, 
instead of the exception. She simply laid there and wrestled with the bumper-to-bumper style 
orgasms she was experiencing. And not just singular, full-body climaxes. No, that wouldn’t have 
been nearly as exciting or novel to her.  </p>
<p>Her thighs crossed from the energy shooting through them, slamming into the soles of her feet. 
Her heels rose and fell, legs straight at the knees with a clench before tumbling into the sheets. 
Her abs became a solid wall like she was preparing for a punch to the gut from a mixed martial 
artist, then went featureless as it relaxed. Every whisper of a wrinkle on her face came out at the 
expressions she portrayed: joy, bliss, rage, passion, confusion, bewilderment, and utter 
surrender. And when she finally reached a respite in a sexual trough, she could do little more 
than pant like the animal in heat she had become.  </p>
<p>Better than all of it, though, were the rolls and rolls of orgasms smacking her inside her tits. 
People would think her crazy for describing the sensation she felt in her chest to be orgasmic, 
yet it was nothing short of it. She blew, erupted, belched, and exploded. Milk went flying. She 
made the room rain around her—on her, around her.  </p>
<p>And there was something about being captive to her body in this way that was just on the right 
side of a dangerous balancing act. </p>
<p>​
​
Olena, baby. . .” 
Ooo, 
​</p>
<p>Soon, she found herself in a dazzling state of clarity. Olena observed her body at work—in a 
sort of glory.  </p>
<p>“Would you cool it? You’re making a mess. I’m never getting my security deposit back,” Nicole 
chided.  </p>
<p>Olena sucked in a deep breath, something to bring in her jittery nerves. “It’s amazing. My 
body—you made my body do this?” </p>
<p>The patter of her milk on furniture made for rhythmic accompanying sounds. She had to be 
putting out ounces and ounces at a time; an unseen, impossible rate of expression. </p>
<p>made your body do this. Together. You wanted it and I made it happen. I

​
couldn’t do this stuff without you—Ooo! </p>
<p>The Russian winked at what she’d done. “I learn quick, when I want to.” She had been laying on 
her back and watching Nicole’s gorgeous face sitting on top of her breast. There was a swell of 
intimate energy in her head at the sight, and instead of pushing down, she let it consume her. 
Olena sort of suspected that it was the type of urge that Nicole wouldn’t be able to ignore.  </p>
<p>It was kind of cool to know that whenever she wanted Nicole to just focus on sucking her 
stiffened peaks, all she needed to do was imagine it and let the most sexual corner of her mind 
do the rest.  </p>
<p>Olena moaned, knocked back when the basest desires of her soul were met. Saint Nicole 
descended onto her firing nipple with jaw spread wide. The force of her cream splattered back 
at first, but the silver-haired woman adopted a vacuum suction with her lips and began hiding 
away what had to have been gallons of breast milk.The copious amount of warm milk had 
slicked her hair down and white streaks trickled into the dips of her eyes, hooking at her nose.  </p>
<p>Nicole stuck out her tongue after swallowing a several seconds of nonstop cream and simply 
licked at Olena’s rod. She seemed romanced by it, like sucking and drinking from a nipple was 
the peak of sexual experience. Nothing meant more than how she rolled the blasting nexus of 
milk across her face; felt its power in her hand, kept it clean with her full lips. “I was wrong. Your 
milk tastes </p>
<p>“Oddly,” Olena said, shrugging. “My pussy isn’t offended.”  </p>
<p>Nicole. . . keep sucking. Don’t talk—suck my nipples. Please. They’re gushing just for you.  </p>
<p>“

​</p>
<p>“I wanted to make sure you understood how much I 
how I feel.” </p>
<p>“I had no idea how raw and huge it was. . . I guess the milk brought it out.” </p>
<p>It had seemed natural after seeing her milk. Olena didn’t know where it came from—something 
about Nicole already being so close to her nipple, maybe. But having her milk get sucked out of 
her engorged breasts had taken up every sexual priority in her mind. Usually, she could keep 
herself in check. Gaining the ability to lactate, though, multiplied and uncovered what was there 
all along. </p>
<p>This. This is what I’ve wanted all along. Don’t waste it. </p>
<p>Nicole spoke no more. Gorging herself on Olena’s production was of first importance.  </p>
<p>Olena lactated longer and harder, still. There was nothing else she could’ve wanted. It was 
bizarrely and completely fulfilling to her, feeling herself grow to such a size only to share that 
size fully, entirely, with a woman she felt connected to by fate and love and in body.  </p>
<p>Olena’s milky streams only intensified for two straight minutes. They reacted to Nicole’s mouth, 
surging with a force and viscosity that made Olean’s skin feel tight enough to rupture. Watching, 
the owner of the storm in the bedroom could see the difference as one breast rumbled and 
chirped with quickly changing volumes and the other continued to do so but without the cap of a 
mouth and throat. Milk from her right breast crossed the whole of the room. It made puddles on 
the floors; ran down dressers like a spilled glass of steamy froth. A curtain that was drawn back 
had its color darkened as it absorbed all the heavy cream and slumped in its holders, made 
heavy by the absorption. It was almost as if the roof was leaking, but no amount of buckets or 
kitchen pans would ever be enough to catch all the liquid pouring from above.  </p>
<p>Then there was the other breast—just as full and powerful and lively. It thrummed with living 
nectar as well but was contained by Nicole. The level of grace on her face belied what her body 
was being battered with. Every so often, she would look up with big eyes and shoot a wink 
Olena’s way. Cocky, somehow. Amazing. She knew where she wanted to be—was skilled in a 
task that she couldn’t have practiced to become so proficient.  </p>
<p>She’s not missing a single drop. </p>
<p>The room quickly filled with a sugary scent, like walking into Paper Cuts when their sweet, warm 
brews were in high demand on a cold day. Olena’s milky scent rose from the ground and fell 
from the air, claiming the room, filling it with a damp, dewey feel. The hotel staff were going to 
freak. The feel of mist in the air would take hours to go away. And the perfumed scent of 
Olena’s natural ambrosia might never come out. Olena worried about it momentarily but found </p>
<p>​
herself floating away in the sensation of suction on her left breast. It was steadier than the 
worry, noisier that her greatest anxieties.  </p>
<p>Then, fifteen minutes later, she realized that her rain had stopped. The assault she’d made 
against the suite of a room ended. Her titties were pacified to the point of a steady drip and the 
sense that she would remain a human sprinkler for the rest of her life ended. </p>
<p>A slow, beautiful stretch of time began, where Olena could lay and give back to Nicole for 
everything the woman had done this holiday season. </p>
<p>She closed her eyes and let herself be milked till the sensation of it lulled her into an afternoon 
nap. </p>
<hr />
<p>Olena crawled out of a different bed. One that was dry and warm. It had been cold before, 
wherever she was, but here it was like she was under a weighted blanket.  </p>
<p>Then, she went to move and realized that no, there wasn’t a blanket, but that her boobs were 
responsible for the warmth and softness and weight.  </p>
<p>She flung herself to the left; feet hit the ground. Different material on the floors. Different lighting. 
Different layout. Dry, wood floors. Lamp light instead of natural lighting. The ceiling—her milking 
position had been on her back, so she felt she knew the ceiling pretty well; like an old friend, 
almost—was different. Different color and height. It even had a fan.  </p>
<p>Where am I? 
Asked an inner voice. 
​</p>
<p>But when anxiety tried answering, it spoke timidly. It lacked the impact that was usually a 
consuming force. </p>
<p>There were none of the usual questions: </p>
<p>Where are my clothes? Did watch me fall asleep? Will they think I’m a freak for having tits like 
these? What if I get so embarrassed that my heart rate goes up, I have a heart attack, then die? 
I’ll always be known as the weirdo immigrant girl who died of embarrassment in a bed under her 
giant boobs.  </p>
<p>None of it was there. Her mind was at peace.  </p>
<p>She did have the desire to scout her new surroundings, though—. . . </p>
<p>“Hey babe.” </p>
<p>Olena rolled her head over. Just that one move informed her that her hair was an absolute 
mess. Normal girls had bed head. She had ‘just got out of a fight with a bed and lost’ head.  </p>
<p>Amazing sex does that to a girl, as does falling asleep to the suckling of a sexy woman.  </p>
<p>That woman was on the threshold of the door now, her hip braced against it. She was in a clean 
red tee and candy cane striped panties.  </p>
<p>“Hey,” Olena croaked and heard utter happiness in her voice.  </p>
<p>“You want help standing up?” </p>
<p>“Please.” Olena hadn’t wanted to try. Her body still felt languid and loose from sleep. </p>
<p>Nicole had to have felt the tracest want from Olena and come running. It was so sexy to have 
someone know everything she wanted without having to confess or suppress it.  </p>
<p>Together, they hefted Olena’s body up and away from the bed. Olena didn’t have the protection 
of clothing like Nicole had, so when she was on her feet she felt her skin awakening where her 
breasts hung down.  </p>
<p>They were still unwieldy things, so she was happy that Nicole’s magic that helped her manage 
them was still in tact. In her euphoria it had been hard to tell, but at some point during her 
milk-induced haziness she’d taken note of how much titty she had acquired. While there was no 
way to measure, Olena would have sworn that she hadn’t stopped growing until her sweet 
globes reached both sides of the bed, squishy segments of her flanks dangling over the floor. 
She had to have crested above a Z cup. At such a size, cup sizes seemed irrelevant, sure, but 
there was a pride in being so large that the alphabet itself couldn’t even contain her. </p>
<p>For now, she was about where she was that morning. She was beginning to be able to tell how 
her P cups felt; to treat that as her ‘normal’ cup size.  </p>
<p>“You were a sight to behold, sweetheart,” Nicole said, speaking low. “You have every right to be 
proud.” </p>
<p>“I’m that proud?” Olena asked. “That you can feel it in me?” </p>
<p>“I can feel it, sure, but it’s also written all over your face. You’re so cute—you like your boobies 
so much that you smile whenever you think about how big they are. You were definitely the 
biggest and milkiest I’ve seen anyone.” </p>
<p>“Even Limey?” </p>
<p>Nicole scrunched up her nose. “Okay. Second biggest—still the biggest out of everyone I’ve 
made love with.”  </p>
<p>A blush came to her nose, but the embarrassment had little to do with it. Olena’s heart flittered, 
elevated, eager. “Where are my clothes?” Olena asked. “And where am I?” </p>
<p>“We ruined the other room so I had them put us in a new, clean suite. Don’t worry, I had the 
foresight to wait until you stopped the fireworks,” Nicole smiled. </p>
<p>“Wait, you moved me the way I was? With no clothes on? Through a hotel. . .” </p>
<p>Nicole simply winked.  </p>
<p>Hand in hand, they exited the master suite and came into a dipping living space. Even bigger 
than the one in the other suite, this space featured its own coffee bar and two televisions that 
were the size of a wall in Olena’s family home. Currently, the image of a fireplace was on both 
wall screens and crackling noise emitted from a speaker hidden in a corner. It was built in to 
complete the sleekness of the room’s aesthetic.  </p>
<p>Nicole didn’t ask—didn’t even have to. She wrapped a large blanket around Olena and made 
her a coffee in a large ceramic mug. Olena barely even thought about the things she wanted in 
her coffee and Nicole picked up on each one. It was like how Jersey knew just the right way to 
make drinks for her, except where Jersey had employed trial and error, Nicole just stumbled into 
new knowledge as she worked.  </p>
<p>It didn’t take much waiting for Olena to start getting antsy again. The cool air made her nipples 
beg. “Hmm,” she said, barely making a sound. When she looked down, the sight of herself drew 
her hands to her marshmallow-like projections. They were dough in her hands again, but only to 
a point. With a careful feel, she could sense the fluid still inside of her; dormant now, but there. 
And as her gentle rubbing turned into a more meaningful caress, the liquid heat collected, 
gathering in a pool just behind her nipples.  </p>
<p>Nicole turned, a mug in her hand, a pleasant expression on her face. “Working yourself up 
again?” </p>
<p>“You don’t understand,” Olena replied. “It’s like they only feel right if someone’s touching them.” </p>
<p>Nicole shook her head. “Looks like I’ve gone and spoiled your plump, milky titties. Great. Now 
I’m never going to hear the end of it.” The silver-haired woman placed a flat palm on Olena’s </p>
<p>back to pull them close together. Then, she bent at the waist and used her free hand to lift one 
of Olena’s immaculate globes to her mouth.  </p>
<p>The contact of a mouth sent a jolt through Olena. She felt the sensation of warm release; the 
firing of a million firecrackers under the attended areola. Nicole made the cutest sounds as she 
sucked and swallowed; just the right balance of drink and suction. Her plump lips hid, slipped, 
and carressed soft skin. Meanwhile, parcels of body-warmed cream made her throat work to get 
it down. They were a unit together, made complete by this activity.  </p>
<p>The fifteen or so seconds they shared felt like heaven.  </p>
<p>“Ahh,” Nicole sighed, stretching after she released Olena’s teat. “Yup, I’ll have to deal with you 
wanting me to suck you for as long as we’re together. Wonder how long till I get tired of it?” </p>
<p>Olena pouted. “You’d better not get tired of it—you’re the reason they started leaking in the first 
place.” It seemed a harsh thing of Nicole to say, given Olena’s suspicions and fears today. But it 
had served to illuminate something important: that the fear of abandonment, when it came to 
mind, didn’t have rule over her feelings anymore. Her greatest fear used to be that Nicole would 
leave just as miraculously as she had popped up into her life. She’d been taught not to trust 
blessings from the universe; not to take handouts. It created a sense of impermanence about 
their relationship, and that used to evoke real fear for Olena. </p>
<p>But Nicole’s serenity as she drank; the care she took over Olena’s body when she was amid a 
storm of confusion. The words they had exchanged and the experience of a lifetime Olena had 
just awakened from. </p>
<p>Olena just couldn’t feel that fear anymore. </p>
<p>Nicole kissed Olena’s nose. “I’m not going anywhere. Never. You’re stuck with me.” </p>
<p>“I know,” Olena replied, cute and short. </p>
<p>The two sat on the plush couches. Unlike the rest of the room, the couches did seema little old 
fashioned. They were made with leather. The seat Olena took squeaked as her body sank into 
it. Her breasts patted gently onto her thighs and she took a sip of her coffee to make sure it 
would be okay for her while they had their conversation. A hand lit on her breast—by now it was 
as much impulse as intention that she touch herself. </p>
<p>In response to a question Olena had only thought about asking, Nicole answered. “I know what 
you were thinking when you met Limey. Is it really milk? Can a girl be full of that much milk? I 
want that much milk. It seemed like an easy thing to give you with it being the holidays.” Nicole 
looked thoughtful for a moment. “You’d need to ask her about that if it were June or something, </p>
<p>though. I can only make a girl produce like that once or twice a year. Limey, as you can see, 
has no trouble having a cream filling year round.” </p>
<p>“So I’m going to stop lactating?” </p>
<p>“Nah. You’ll stay milky. You just won’t be short circuiting anymore lamps or televisions.” Nicole 
paused and rethought her statement. “Easily. You won’t ruin electronics without trying. If you are 
feeling particularly anti-tech, you’ll still have the firepower available.”  </p>
<p>“I didn’t mean to. . .” </p>
<p>“Hmm?” </p>
<p>Olena stopped, sighed, and squeezed her boobs just enough to remind herself of how awesome 
her night had been. </p>
<p>“That’s shame,” Nicole answered the silent plea in Olena’s head. “But you have nothing to be 
ashamed of. We couldn’t have known how much you’d produce. And don’t worry, I’ll cover 
everything. Neither of us knew how much we would enjoy ourselves with huge, milky jugs. I 
personally didn’t think I could love you anymore than I already do. . . It was a fun learning 
experience. ” </p>
<p>“You’re right,” Olena nodded. She broke for a moment to sip her drink. “About everything. I 
shouldn’t be ashamed and I’ll ask Limey to help with them. She offered, after all. And her 
breasts are pretty dang hot, all full and stuff.” </p>
<p>“I wouldn’t use ‘hot’ to describe her.” </p>
<p>“Are you two really sisters?” </p>
<p>Nicole nodded. “Not the same parents, but I wouldn’t call us anything else. Why—. . . Yuck! 
Olena, no!” </p>
<p>Olena lips tightened into a frustrated line. “You said I had nothing to be ashamed of. I’m not 
going to be ashamed of my body 
my feelings, okay?” 
or 
​</p>
<p>Nicole flashed with a blush. “I’m not shaming you. But having any of my sisters in our 
relationship? Nu-uh, sorry. The line is drawn.” </p>
<p>Dammit! It was only in my head for two seconds. Can’t I at least fantasize?! </p>
<p>“Not when I can

<p>your fantasies,” Nicole gave Olena’s boob a gentle shove. It wobbled,

​</p>
<p>​
​
 
“Limey’s cute! And Peachy’s got some serious curve on her, too—isn’t Santa’s job to give 
people what they want for Christmas?” </p>
<p>“Only if they haven’t been naughty. And you, missy, are nau-au-ghty.” </p>
<p>They both laughed and kissed at that—the urge to be physical had built all they could stand in 
just a few minutes of being awake; sitting right next to each other. Olena asked to have her 
breasts pleasured which Nicole obliged for a few minutes. Her nipples remained hard, testy as 
trip wire. The rapture she got from letting down her excess milk had her toes curling and her 
arousal multiplying.  </p>
<p>“So you’re okay with the idea of a group, then?” asked Olena when Nicole slowed her suckling 
and proceeded to kiss her up and down. The time for nursing had only lit a fire under them both. 
Their coffees were relegated to go cold on the end table. “Of partners, I mean. Of being 
polyamorous with me. . .” </p>
<p>“I was fine with that from the beginning. It actually works out better for me like that, what with all 
the travelling I do.” Nicole spoke to Olena’s enormous breasts, transfixed by them all over again. 
“But there’s no way I’m leaving these with strangers. I like you having sexual freedom, but some 
people are obviously off limits—gosh, stop it!” Nicole grumbled, pinching Olena where she could 
and getting a cute ‘eep’ in response. “Limey and Peach are banned. You can’t sleep with them! 
That goes for when I’m around and when I’m not. They’re off the negotiation table, got it?” </p>
<p>Olena giggled. The lust for them had sprung up so casually, but it was easily redirected to the 
singular sister whose body was connected with Olena’s by hand and mouth. “Fine. You’re the 
hotter sister anyway. I think I can settle for just one weird, magical sister as long as it’s you.” </p>
<p>“Thanks.” </p>
<p>“Wouldn’t want Santa getting jealous. . .” </p>
<p>Nicole pinched Olena’s nipple again. Olena yelped and her natural blend shot far enough to 
splatter in a dripping line on one of the two televisions.  </p>
<p>The spectacle was so impressive that it silenced their lover’s spat and submerged the two in this 
new breastfeeding love they shared. </p>
<hr />
<p>Christmas Day arrived with Nicole and Olena officially coupled.  </p>
<p>They’d spent the remainder of their night summoning food to their room, watching movies, 
talking, and milking. Olena phoned her parents, her sister, Clarissa and anyone else she 
thought might be worried about her so they knew that she was safe and warm. After that, 
without the burden of a heavy conscience for letting her business remain unfinished for so long, 
she was able to let loose and explore her body and relationship till about ten.  </p>
<p>It had taken hours for the two to tire out completely. If boobs could have headaches, she 
believed hers had them from all the throbbing they had done. </p>
<p>Around nine the next morning, Nicole stumbled back into bed looking exhausted. Olena 
pondered exactly how far the Santa Claus moniker went—as in, had Nicole been up all night 
after putting Olena to bed? If the world had presents they couldn’t explain the origins of, Olena 
now knew where they came from. And maybe Nicole just had an overnight business meeting, 
making her have to travel by private plane overnight. Whatever it was, it didn’t seem like much 
of an emergency based on how easily she stumbled back into the sheets, so Olena didn’t press 
her on it. </p>
<p>With Nicole, she couldn’t always know, but Olena found herself trusting even more with each 
new hour.  </p>
<p>She comforted the jolly old elf with her body. Olena spooned for a while, then served as a 
deluxe pillow for as long as it took Nicole to relax. It was two in the afternoon and Nicole was 
making a meal out of Olena’s engorged bosom before they both decided it was time to be up for 
the day.  </p>
<p>“Merry Christmas, sweetheart,” Nicole said, and even though it was the middle of the afternoon, 
they were the first words the two had verbally exchanged. </p>
<p>“Merry Christmas, Nicole.” </p>
<p>“We should probably give the bed a break. We’ve probably worn out our welcome with her.” </p>
<p>Olena smiled. “True. Let’s get up for a while.” </p>
<p>They readied like newlyweds. They chatted and praised each other’s bodies. Nicole was 
indecisive on what to wear exclusively so they both could enjoy the process of her getting naked 
over and over again. Olena, having nothing in the line of clothing, stood around in nothing and 
happily enjoyed Nicole slipping in and out of the tightest, sexiest, and most revealing clothes 
she’d ever seen. All the while, they were shamelessly flirty and took regular breaks against 
dressers, on carpeted floors, and on stools to make love.  </p>
<p>dress make 
your
​</p>
<p>body look good?” 
my
​</p>
<p>“I think this dress makes your boobs look good,” Nicole commented as she looked in an 
oval-shaped, full body mirror. Somehow, the micro dress she’d squeezed into managed to be 
worse than nudity itself; it showed everything while pretending to conceal.  </p>
<p>“How could </p>
<p>“Because it shows off my boobs. People will see me and say, ‘wow, she has nice boobs’. Then, 
they’ll look over at the woman whose arm I’m hanging from and realize how tiny I am in 
comparison. I should wear this dress whenever I want people to know you have the best jugs in 
the world and that I get them as much as I want.” </p>
<p>Olena smirked. “You could be bigger if you wanted to. The same magic you used to make me 
this size could be used on yourself too, right?”  </p>
<p>Saint Nicole bobbed her head approvingly as she modelled. From the side, her ass looked so 
round and plump that a fire rose in Olena to give it a swat. In that split second, Nicole shimmied 
over close and bent in half so Olena could reach, hearing the mental pleas.  </p>
<p>Olena politely smooched the top of Nicole’s cheek and gave it a high-five through the scant 
amounts of fabric.  </p>
<p>“I’m not the type to be busty. Too many business meetings, too many people that already don’t 
take me seriously as a woman. If I was any bigger, people would discredit me immediately. I’d 
much rather surround myself with powerful women with boobies to their hips—especially ones 
that carry four or five delicious meals in their P cups.” </p>
<p>Olena absently stroked her boobs which, despite regular milkings, hadn’t changed in size. 
“Keep drinking and you’ll start gaining weight. Just watch. The sugar content in me is bound to 
fatten you up.” </p>
<p>Nicole’s smirk reached all the way to her eyes. “And who says you haven't pumped me up 
already?” When Olena made a puzzled face, Nicole simply said, “Watch closely”. She then 
placed a finger beside her nose—with no nearby chimney, so she wasn’t going anywhere—and 
magic made her body change. Her plump ass cheeks pushed away from her hips. Her thighs 
thickened. The breasts that were already spilling out of her top started running away toward her 
chin. But by far, the biggest change was the appearance of a bulbous dome at Nicole’s 
abdomen. Her tummy bloated, gaining volume like it was connected to an air pump. Inflating, 
expanding, swelling. She grew larger and larger till it looked like she’d swallowed a basketball.  </p>
<p>Then, it pressed further than that.  </p>
<p>Olena all but drooled. When the change was complete—as complete as she could fathom, 
anyway—Nicole’s dress had hiked up over her rotund ass and slunk down to show off a pair of </p>
<p>​
​
breasts three cup sizes bigger than before. Yet, what grabbed Olena’s attention were the 
whiskering lines of tension making a hasty getaway from her taut, pregnant belly.  </p>
<p>“How did—. . .” Olena asked. Her eyelashes turned into fans, she was blinking so fast.  </p>
<p>“This is how I would look with no magic alterations. This is what your milk actually does to me,” 
Nicole answered. Her posture sank low and leaned back, a hand appearing below her bloated 
belly to keep it steady. “Just wanted you to know how right you were, that all your milk does 
have to go somewhere.” </p>
<p>“Oh gosh, I’m sorry. I didn’t know—I was just joking. Now, you have to use magic just to look 
professional, and—. . .” </p>
<p>Nicole closed the distance between them and claimed another long draw of milk from Olena’s 
nipple. Whenever Olena was nursing, the mind-numbing pleasure made the rest of her body 
freeze and thaw a thousand times. She said nothing and simply enjoyed the feel of her cream 
being extracted by a gentle, soft mouth.  </p>
<p>“I helped you transform into a version of yourself that you like, and you helped me transform into 
a version of me that I like,” Nicole said plainly when she’d broken away. “I think I look sexy, 
don’t you? This body can certainly handle all these curves.” </p>
<p>The tight skin of Nicole’s tummy pressed into Olena, feeling so huge and full and amazing. That 
sensation, of Nicole’s swollen tummy, was all Olena’s doing. She’d made it possible—had given 
Nicole even more of an hourglass, but tacked on a midsection that was pregnant with her breast 
milk.  </p>
<p>Olena shuddered with sexual need, renewed all over again. “You definitely look sexy.” </p>
<p>Sex. Again, I need it—with that new, sexy body. . . </p>
<p>“You’re insatiable. . .” Nicole growled, and took Olena for yet another round. </p>

normal, albeit a snug fit for her. Imagine, she thought, with all the weight she had gained she 
hadn’t once thought that some might have settled in her bum. Nat had been the one to bring 
that up on Black Friday and she hadn’t given it a second thought since. Now, her jeans felt like 
vices around her thighs and was thin as paper on her ass.  </p>
<p>She was an hourglass and she wished someone had told her how it wouldn’t be comfy at all 
from the waist down. </p>
<p>It was her top that was the comfiest thing she wore; made of a few layers of linen and patterned 
along the seams. Buttons on the front made for easy access—mostly for Nicole since it was 
hard for Olena to even reach the front of her new bust. The rest hanged snug toward her tummy 
so that the shirt fit perfectly, showing off her size first and foremost, then bringing attention to 
how tiny the girl attached to the Q cups were.  </p>
<p>Yes, Q cups. When she had a decent amount of milk, she was a full cup size bigger. </p>
<p>Once they were both dressed—and sworn to sexual truce—Nicole took them both for a ride. 
The driver let them out in front of the Crafty Shack. The parking lot was empty but the lights 
inside were on, making Olena wonder if the store was getting ready to open for the day.  </p>
<p>When she went inside, though, she didn’t find workers scrambling, cleaning, or being debriefed 
on new sales. She found her coworkers dressed semi-formal, all beautiful, talking as they drank 
cider and ate finger foods. Among them were a few other familiar faces:  </p>
<p>Clarissa, Jersey, and Nat. Others too, like Hedda and Raine and a few of her aunts.  </p>
<p>Her mother was sitting with a flute of alcohol. She admired the glassware by twisting her drink 
so it glittered as she showed Olena’s father.  </p>
<p>They all seemed to turn at once toward the automatic door when Olena and Nicole entered. 
Those that were seating stood. Standing people all came forward and formed a semi-circle. 
Jane appeared in a sexy cocktail dress and took Nicole’s other side.  </p>
<p>Together, they all screamed, “Merry Christmas, Olena!” as if they’d been waiting for the moment 
all year long. </p>
<p>Olena burst into tears. </p>
<hr />
<p>Together, they ate and drank. The Crafty Shack became their Christmas party venue. The girls 
sang and danced between the aisles, accompanying the happier, contemporary Christmas 
selection. With alcohol in their systems it took almost zero time for them to turn a fun, family 
event into a strip club. Olena sort of liked it, though.  </p>
<p>Eventually, Nat came over. She apologized profusely and became twice the supportive sister 
she’d always been. “I don’t want you to ever be afraid to tell me anything. I know I blew it. 
Please forgive me, Olena.” Olena did, swearing to never have any secrets between them. She 
then immediately blurted that she and Nicole were an item to which Nat cocked an eyebrow and 
let out a prideful, “Damn, girl,” in an operatic voice. It made Olena’s self-image swell—her 
confidence, this time, and not her actual body.  </p>
<p>She was a very stable Q cup for the moment. Nicole had, fortunately, put a hold on the 
expanding magic because, quote, “I’m not paying for a whole store’s worth of damage. These 
craft places have some expensive stuff and you having twenty foot titties is like being a bull in a 
china shop.” </p>
<p>Following came a parade of her aunts who all also apologized in their broken English. Olena 
didn’t speak much of her mother tongue but knew remorse and repentance when she saw it. 
They each hugged her and tucked their stomachs and hips back to make clearance for Olena’s 
mammoth boobies. They were sorry for having upset her, but not quite ready to accept her 
humongous swath of soft, pillowy size, especially when a hug all but swallowed them. </p>
<p>In time, thought Olena, maybe, they would treat her like normal. And maybe they never would. It 
didn’t bother her much either way, though, which she considered a massive victory.  </p>
<p>Her father gave the most awkward apology of all. No hug, of course. The man was stoic. He 
asked her the only question that seemed pertinent: “So, you don’t pay for the expensive 
American boob surgery, yea?” </p>
<p>Olena remained expressionless, surprised that she didn’t see what her father had really been 
concerned about all along. It was also weird to hear a vodka-chugging Russian man say the 
word ‘boob’ with a straight face. “No. I didn’t have surgery. This happened naturally, daddy.” </p>
<p>He regarded her sternly, then broke into a smile as he gripped his chest. “Thank goodness! That 
size would have cost small fortune—big fortune too. Very big, yes. Sorry, Olena. I no trust you 
as good father should.” And then he turned and explained to Olena’s mother that all was well in 
the universe. Of course, mother poked her head out with a questioning nod to which Olena 
replied with a quick bob of her chin. All that needed saying was in those micro-gestures. What 
mattered most was that he was focused on the money again, which meant he was back to 
normal.  </p>
<p>brought you,” Jane 
Santa
​</p>
<p>When everyone was stuffed with snacks and wine, Jane led the group to the Christmas Tree 
aisle and distracted them all with the decorations. They’d been done in the proper spirit; the 
trees leaned with thee amount of ornaments and lights. There were also wrapped goodies under 
the tree.  </p>
<p>“There’s one for everyone. Please, one at a time—and show us what 
announced.  </p>
<p>The redhead made a sultry look in Nicole’s direction. Olena shouldered Nicole too now that she 
was in on the inside joke. Nicole happened to yawn precisely at that moment, too tired to fight it, 
like her whole body was just screaming in response to the subtext. “Yes! That’s me. I’m Santa. I 
bought the stuff. Hardy har har.” Cute and funny. She got a well-earned hug for her efforts.  </p>
<p>Then, after a few staff members and family had unwrapped their exorbitant gifts—expensive 
wines, tickets to amusement parks, a week long vacation to Fiji for Olena’s parents since neither 
of them had gotten any time away in decades—Nicole pulled Olena away from the excited 
crowd. It was just when she began to wonder if Nicole’s capacity for charity could ever reach an 
end. If Olena’s parents got a tropical week-long getaway, what were the other people going to 
get?  </p>
<p>What am I going to get? </p>
<p>Nicole locked her lips. They walked in silence even as Olena’s mind buzzed with curiosity and 
Nicole bolstered her heart against her lover’s sincerest pleas, which she no doubt sensed like 
tickles up and down her spine.  </p>
<p>The door to the break room stood before them. Nicole opened it with a flourish and Olena 
struggled through the door because of her size. It had seemed so still inside that she thought it 
empty; that maybe her present was just sex in an empty room with Nicole, which would’ve been 
amazing in Olena’s opinion. Instead, the sound of chatter and giggling sent a twitch through her 
body. She froze. Nicole had to help dislodge and calm her.  </p>
<p>Everyone was there—the ones Olena had cared so much about lately. Somehow, each of them 
had disappeared during the gift exchange and made their way here, to giggle at how her 
boobies had had to get intimate with the threshold of entryways just to get the rest of her inside.  </p>
<p>In one of those flimsy, gray plastic chairs with cutouts in the back was Jersey. Nearby, in a 
similar chair, was Raine. Clarissa was reading the inspirational quotes on the bulletin board 
when Olena’s entrance snagged her attention. Jackie, the runner up in the sales contest, leaned 
stylishly against the drink machine, a hand in her pocket, the other holding her phone.  </p>
<p>It wasn’t until they were all in a room with her, watching her, smiling at her. . . </p>
<p>​

babes
​</p>
<p>. . . These girls were absolute </p>
<p>“Uh, did I miss something?” Olena said. She turned and looked at Nicole.  </p>
<p>Nicole bobbled her shoulders noncommittally. “Yes and No. We’re still waiting on one person to 
get here—. . .” </p>
<p>“Here. Just barely managed to break away,” Jane said, pushing past and taking a spot at the 
center of the room. “What’s the announcement, babe?” </p>
<p>“Announcement?” Olena looked again at Nicole; harder this time, with depth and threat.  </p>
<p>“I’ve gathered you all here today—. . .” Nicole started.  </p>
<p>Jane clapped her hands. “Cut to the chase? They’re expecting me at the gift exchange. I’m the 
host of everything.” </p>
<p>“Olena’s present isn’t under that tree,” Nicole started again, taking Jane’s insistence to heart. 
“Olena, your present is in this room. I did a little probing behind the scenes. As it turns out, the 
women in your life are more open than you initially thought.” </p>
<p>“More open?” Olena asked.  </p>
<p>Jersey, unashamed, bold, spoke up first. “Nicole contacted all of us, kind of figuring out what our 
feelings were about being in open relationships with you. It was a secret thing. I can’t speak for 
the others, but I’ve personally been talking to her for a few weeks now.” </p>
<p>“You’ve what? Jersey!” </p>
<p>Jersey threw up her hands. “Relax, relax. It wasn’t meant to be a secret. It was more like 
research—a survey. She somehow already knew that you were polyamorous and was genuine 
about what she thought would be a good gift for you.” </p>
<p>“So my gift is. . . All the pretty girls I know?” Olena pondered out loud.  </p>
<p>The girls giggled again, making Olena blush.  </p>
<p>“Your gift is a little simulation. I told you I have a home where I go when I’m not doing business? 
Well, I’ve invited all of these girls to go and spend a few days out there, all expenses paid, to 
see if being in a corporate relationship would be right for them. That seemed like the best 
compromise.” Nicole’s hand fell where it always did; gracing Olena’s lower back in a perfect 
blend of seductive touch and emotional support. “And there’s a few rules. To make this more 
realistic—. . .” </p>
<p>​
 
Jackie spoke up. “Sex. With whoever we want, whenever we want. Consent, of course, but 
otherwise it’s orgy city.” </p>
<p>“And alone time, too,” Clarissa butted in. “For when we want intimacy w-with just two people.” </p>
<p>“Date nights as groups and couples,” Raine spoke. “So we can get to know each other better, 
like, in groups of two or three.” </p>
<p>“And plenty of fun activities to help bond and forge friendships,” said Jersey. </p>
<p>“Most important,” said Jane. “Is that we do whatever is necessary to make this work. We’re all 
committed to trying out non-monogamy. We’re all each other’s partners. Every one of us is for 
the rest of us.” </p>
<p>“Unless we really start to couple off. Then, we can start having primary and secondary 
couplings,” Nicole topped off the conversation, which was frothy with light, bubbly amazement 
as it was. “We’ll be flexible, and keep to everyone’s comfort zones. If you want out, you’re free 
to leave. But based on the responses from our correspondence, it would seem that everyone is 
more than committed to at least trying.” </p>
<p>“But how? Why? Everyone. . . Why is everyone trying this? You didn’t force it on them—. . .” 
Olena managed a shriek in a whisper, working herself into worry. </p>
<p>But Nicole soothed her with a look. “For you, of course. We all think you deserve it. We love 
you, so of course we’d give this a try.” </p>
<p>The girls in the room made a corporate sound of approval. </p>
<p>“Guys. . .” Olena blubbered, amazed by the way all the women in her life were so committed to 
her. They all, in their own ways, for their own reasons, had come to the idea that this could 
work—that they ought to try and make it work for a person that was special to them. “This is all 
so. . . I-I didn’t expect—. . .” </p>
<p>Before a tear ever fell, everyone was on their feet. They fit themselves as best they could 
around Olena’s giant shapes; found a space to hold or touch or hug her. Olena sensed each 
and every touch on her breasts. Every kiss on her neck and shoulders sizzled in her ears. Their 
words of encouragement opened wide and enveloped her heart, safeguarding it from worry. 
Their beauty bolstered her gratitude—she was so damned lucky to be alive and loved.  </p>
<p>And wrapped up in their huddle, Olena’s tears waned and made room for stronger, more 
visceral tendencies.  </p>
<p>“Are those your nipples getting hard?” Jackie blurted first. “Holy shit, that feels like a dick—not 
even going to lie. Their fucking huge.” </p>
<p>“Their proportional to my body!” Olena yelled in her own defense.  </p>
<p>The room burst into laughter.  </p>
<p>And soon, if Jackie continued to stroke up and down their lengths, those nipples would burst 
into a milky fit of unstoppable flow. </p>
<p>Something told Olena that every girl in the room was counting on it. And that was what had 
been on her Christmas List all along. </p>
<p>“Happy Holidays, Olena,” Nicole seized a smooch amid the laughter. </p>
<p>“I love you—love you all. So much. Thank you, Nicole. Thank you.” </p>
<p>Just then, a mighty swirl of wind threw the nest of women against the wall; not strong enough to 
hurt, but violent enough to get their attention and send the jumpy ones (Clarissa and Raine) 
running toward the door.  </p>
<p>Through squinted eyes, two forms could be made out amid spiralling plastic cups and old 
napkins pulled from their dispensers. A plastic chair rolled along the ground like a tumbleweed. 
Women screamed in Olena’s ear, worried. She looked to Nicole, like the mascot for Christmas 
and giving could give her some sort of reassurance.  </p>
<p>Nicole’s expression deadpanned. “Dammit,” she mouthed.  </p>
<p>“So I heard someone say ‘orgy city’? Why wasn’t I included in this discussion?” </p>
<p>With a sudden 
and size and color.  </p>
<p>Peach and Limey stood in the wake of it.  </p>
<p>Limey browsed the space around them, seeing the mess they’d made. She bounced over and 
righted the chair their appearance had sent flying, then bowed her head to the gaggle of ladies 
in the corner. “Sorry. That’s just how we get around—all wind and stuff. I’ll get somebody to help 
clean up.” </p>
<p>“Limey, Limey, Limey,” Peach knelt down to her sister’s side and scooped her in under her left 
arm. With her right she presented an open palm. “You’re worried about the breakroom when 
there’s a ton of sexy girls fresh for the picking? Look around. Feast your eyes.” </p>
<p>, the wind broke from its spiral in a burst. The shady figures gained contour 
pop
​</p>
<p>​
 
Limey’s eyes went straight to Olena’s. The purple-haired milk factory of a girl winked. When 
Olena’s nerves struck and her face shifted to show her nerves, Limey started to giggle with 
excitement.  </p>
<p>“So cute,” Limey said.  </p>
<p>Peach patted her shoulder. “Exactly.” </p>
<p>Nicole roared to life, barking over the crowd. “They’re mine, okay? Mine! And you can’t have 
them!” </p>
<p>The room was silent for a spell, then nearly burst with laughter.  </p>
