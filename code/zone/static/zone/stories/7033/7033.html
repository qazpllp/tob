<p>Echo II</p>
<p>by Goldleaf </p>
<p>She had managed to wait four days, but it had been tough. 
What  she  had  seen  in  the  window  would  be  impossible  to 
forget. She had fancied her neighbour ever since moving into 
the  marina  village  last  year.  Marc  had  moved  into  his 
waterside apartment around the same time as she had moved 
in  opposite  him,  and,  having  bumped  into  each  other  a  few 
times  around  their  small  seaside  community,  they  had 
become  accustomed  to  seeing  each  other  around.  They’d 
become  friends  on  Facebook  through  the  residents’  group, 
but  that  hadn’t  really  given  her  much  insight  into  his  life;  his 
proﬁle  was  buttoned  up  pretty  tight.  She  didn’t  even  know 
how old he was. From the conversations they’d had, and from 
scrutinising his warm and open yet somewhat chiselled face, 
she  suspected  that  he  was  a  few  years  older  than  her.  She 
herself was only 23, so guessing him to be in his late twenties 
made sense to her. What he did for a living, or where he went 
with  his  friends,  was  a  mystery.  Though  they’d  had  several, 
fairly lengthy conversations out and about around the marina, 
he’d  kept  the  conversation  focused  largely  on  her.  She’d 
found it ﬂattering, acutely aware of the occasions when she’d 
blushed  at  his  compliments,  and,  afterwards,  she’d  always 
found herself a little disappointed at the fact he hadn’t asked 
her out. Sometimes, when she caught sight of him driving out 
of the car park or pottering around his house on the other side 
of  their  little  marina  inlet,  she  daydreamed  about  taking  the 
matter  into  her  own  hands  and  asking  him  out  for  a  coﬀee. 
Though  she  sometimes  saw  him  with  another  girl,  there  was 
never  enough  consistency  for  her  to  suspect  he  had  a 
girlfriend – but clearly, she always thought with a sigh, she just 
wasn’t his type. And, after seeing the events of previous night, 
she had no doubt.</p>
<p>Firstly, she was short. Only a smidge over 5’6”. Then there 
was her entirely ﬂat physique. She had no boobs and no arse 
to  speak  of.  Her  puberty  had  peaked  to  leave  her  with  not-
quite-B-cups which, given the hobby she kept secret from her 
friends  and  family,  was  something  she  was  constantly  and </p>
<p>painfully  reminded  of.  Because  every  other  girl  she  saw  in 
cosplay seemed to have big boobs – or at least a nice round 
bum – and she had neither. The only thing that worked in her 
favour  was  her  talent  for  makeup,  and  though  she  always 
ended up feeling a little inadequate at comic conventions and 
other  cosplay  events,  she  was  frequently  told  that  she  was 
one of the most beautiful girls there; her long hair framed her 
striking  blue  eyes  and  perfect  nose  with  it’s  little  point,  and 
whilst the rest of her was devoid of shape, her lips had a little 
plumpness  to  them  which  –  people  said  –  made  her  whole 
radiate when she smiled.</p>
<p>Physically,  of  course,  she  tried  to  help  herself  where  and 
when  she  could.  On  a  few  occasions  when  she’d  made  full-
body costumes, she’d integrated the padded bottom part of a 
pair  of  cycling  shorts  deep  into  the  lining  to  try  and  give  her 
rear a little more swell. When it came to her cosplay Instagram 
account and YouTube makeup tutorial videos – were she was 
only  visible  from  the  waist  up  –  she  stooped  to  another  low. 
She stuﬀed her bra.</p>
<p>Whilst her boobs may only have been small, her petite and 
narrow  frame  meant  that,  with  the  right  push-up  bra  and  the 
careful  placement  of  some  additional  material,  she  was  able 
to give her pert little B-cups just enough cleavage to give the 
appearance of C or even D-cup bulges in her top.</p>
<p>Ever since the events of the other night however, her over-
active  imagination  had  run  away  with  itself.  Her  dreams  had 
taken  a  dirty,  lustful  turn,  and  on  a  couple  of  occasions  now 
she had dressed in some of her favourite cosplay outﬁts and 
stuﬀed her bra more than ever before. Though it was obvious 
that  it  wasn’t  real,  that  hadn’t  stopped  her  from  tiptoeing 
around her bedroom, her hands caressing the fake boobs as 
she  felt  herself  ﬂush;  an  excited  tingle  blossoming  between 
her thighs which, on at least one occasion, had led her to her 
bed and a frenzied yet embarrassed orgasm.</p>
<p>Finally, she had had enough. Though she had thought of a 
million  diﬀerent  ways  of  doing  it  –  even  fantasising  about 
walking right up to his front door and just asking him to do it – 
she had gone with the option more inline with her personality. 
She  had  messaged  him  on  Facebook  and,  squirming  in  her 
chair as she hit send, asked him out for dinner.</p>
<p>Why, why, why did it have to be dinner?! 
She  stood  outside  her  front  door  and  chastised  herself. 
She  could  have  just  suggested  drinks.  She  could  have  just 
invited him straight to hers. But from every interaction they’d 
ever  had,  she  sensed  that  he  was  a  genuinely  nice  guy  and 
there  was  a  tiny  part  of  her  that  felt  bad.  She  was,  in  eﬀect, 
planning on simply using him.</p>
<p>Would it even work? 
She had wondered a few times whether it was his ability or, 
somehow,  the  mystery  woman’s.  If  it  wasn’t  his,  she’d  be 
wasting  her  time  and,  if  she  wasn’t  careful,  she’d  embarrass 
herself too. She recalled the sight of him lying on his back on 
his  sofa,  his  enormous  penis  erect  hovering  above  his 
muscular abdomen. Despite the cool evening air, she felt her 
body ﬂush a little, a faint tingle blossoming between her legs.</p>
<p>‘Hey! How’re you?’</p>
<p>She actually jumped as the sound of his voice snapped her 
from  her  daydream.  The  plan  had  been  for  him  to  knock  for 
her, but she had seen him coming and left her house to meet 
him. She turned to look up at him as he approached. Wearing 
a  leather  jacket,  shirt  and  jeans,  he  looked  smarter  than  she 
had expected. Taller too. </p>
<p>‘You  look  great,’  he  said  as  he  came  to  a  stop  in  front  of 
her,  a  broad,  easy-going  smile  extending  upward  from  his 
mouth to his eyes. </p>
<p>Her  heart  ﬂuttered  at  the  compliment  and  she  felt  herself 
blush.  She  had  agonised  for  hours  over  what  to  wear, 
ultimately  settling  on  a  skirt  –  jeans  betrayed  her  ﬂat  arse  – 
and  a  sleeveless  halter  neck  top.  Underneath,  she’d  chosen 
her  favourite  purple  lingerie  set,  the  bra  padded  and  ﬁlled  a 
little  with  more  expertly  placed  stuﬃng.  You  could  just  about 
see the lacy purple fabric peeking out from the side of the top, 
and she’d carefully arranged for the front to show oﬀ as much 
cleavage as possible. Though it wasn’t much, she hoped that<br />
with  the  surrounding  bulge  beneath  her  top,  it  would 
convincingly appear as though she was rocking D-cups.</p>
<p>‘You  look  good  too,’  she  replied,  stepping  forward  as  he 
opened  his  arms  to  give  her  a  friendly  hug.  Placing  her  own 
around him, she rested an open palm in the small of his back </p>
<p>as  she  squeezed  him  gently.  His  body  was  muscular,  and  as 
she  felt  his  arms  settle  around  her,  she  felt  another  wave  of 
excitement wash over her as her breasts – both real and fake 
– pressed ﬁrmly against his lower abdomen. One of her knees 
jerked  a  little,  as  though  it  had  almost  buckled,  and  she  felt 
his strong hands press into her a little ﬁrmer as he held her. </p>
<p>‘Shall we…?’ he asked as they separated, gesturing toward </p>
<p>the marina’s restaurant area.</p>
<p>She nodded and smiled her most dazzling smile.</p>
<p>Though  she  had  gone  to  pains  to  make  sure  it  was  clear 
she was asking him out on a date, she had also made sure to 
keep the suggestion casual and, more importantly, keep them 
local.  Ideally,  she  had  wanted  to  remain  within  walking 
distance  of  her  apartment,  and,  as  a  result,  they  had  chosen 
to visit the Italian chain restaurant on the water’s edge only a 
few hundred metres from their front doors.</p>
<p>Having  been  shown  to  a  small  booth  –  it  was  a  weekday 
and  the  restaurant  was  quiet  –  the  two  had  settled  into  an 
easy  conversation  full  of  laughter  and,  to  her  delight,  ﬂirting. 
He had ordered a beer and she had chosen a cocktail, and as 
they sipped their way through them and a sharing platter for a 
starter,  she  enjoyed  the  way  he  leant  forward  and  engaged 
with  her  as  they  chatted.  Not  only  did  it  bring  his  handsome 
face  closer  to  her,  it  also  gave  her  the  opportunity  to  check 
out  the  muscles  in  his  arms  as  he  rested  them  against  the 
table. She mirrored him, leaning forward and oﬀering him the 
best view of her cleavage. Her long hair, which she’d recently 
spent hundreds of pounds to have dyed near-white to match 
her  latest  cosplay,  sat  tucked  obediently  behind  her  left  ear 
whilst  occasionally  the  right  side  continued  to  fall  across  her 
face  and  down  onto  her  faintly  bulging  breasts.  Though  she 
didn’t want to make it too obvious, she always made sure she 
nudged  them  a  little  as  she  brushed  it  back  into  place,  a 
warmth  spreading  between  her  thighs  on  the  occasion  she’d 
caught him looking.</p>
<p>I just want bigger boobs. 
She  found  herself  whispering  it  silently  to  herself  in  her 
head  as  she  stared  across  the  table  at  him,  smiling  or 
laughing  at  his  jokes.  It  was  easy;  he  was  a  genuinely  funny </p>
<p>guy;  easy-going  and  easy  to  talk  to.  Despite  everything,  she 
realised, she would enjoy their date no matter what happened 
or how it ended. </p>
<p>Does he fancy me though? Is this going to work? 
Her leg accidentally brushed up against his underneath the </p>
<p>table and she didn’t move it away. </p>
<p>I just want big boobs.  </p>
<p>They  had  almost  ﬁnished  their  main  courses  when  he 
excused himself and headed oﬀ in search of the bathroom. A 
smile still spread across her face, she ate another mouthful of 
food, revelling in the enjoyable evening she was having. </p>
<p>She  had  to  admit  that  her  anticipation  was  growing,  her 
pulse  quickening  at  the  thought  of  their  meal  ending;  a  now 
familiar  warmth  spreading  from  beneath  the  purple  panties 
she wore beneath her skirt.</p>
<p>Brushing  her  hair  back  behind  her  ear,  noting  the  purple 
edge of her bra poking clearly out from the side of her halter 
neck top, she glanced down at her cleavage. </p>
<p>Her  eyes  narrowed.  Though  the  top  she  wore  was  slightly 
too small for her padded boobs – stretching it slightly over the 
front of her lacy bra – it seemed as though her cleavage had 
developed  a  more  bulging  appearance  to  it  than  that  which 
she had engineered. It was only slight, but as she sat upright 
in  the  booth  and  took  a  deep,  excited  breath,  she  felt  a 
tightness to her bra that was decidedly new.</p>
<p>She  took  a  long,  full  breath,  watching  as  her  chest 
expanded,  the  stuﬀed  contents  of  her  bra  rising  as  her 
cleavage pushed further out of the neckline of her top than it 
had when she’d done the exact same thing at home. </p>
<p>Were her boobs actually bigger? 
She took a furtive glance around and, quickly, gave them a 
squeeze.  Her  breath  caught  in  her  throat  and  her  legs 
squirmed. </p>
<p>Not much. But they were! 
‘Did you miss me?’</p>
<p>He  was  back,  and  she  glanced  quickly  up  at  him  like  a 
child  almost  caught  doing  something  naughty.  She  knew  her 
face was ﬂushed, and whilst she longed to avoid his gaze, she </p>
<p>tried to examine his expression for a hint of anything unusual. 
But there was nothing. Just a look of slight confusion over her 
somewhat breathless answer. </p>
<p>They had ﬁnished dinner, shared a desert –</p>
<p>This way going way better than expected! 
– and ﬁnished their last drink. He’d had three beers now, to 
her  three  cocktails.  Whether  he’d  noticed  her  last  one  was 
alcohol-free or not, she wasn’t sure, but if the evening went as 
planned she wanted to have a clear mind. </p>
<p>Leaving  the  restaurant,  and  confronted  with  a  row  of  bars 
to  their  right,  she  gauged  the  mood  of  the  date  so  far  and 
took a gamble. </p>
<p>‘I  don’t  suppose  you’d  like  to  come  for  a  drink  at  mine?’ </p>
<p>she asked. ‘It’s not far from here.’</p>
<p>She  laughed  and  smiled  coyly  up  at  him  as  he  stood 
beside  her.  The  slowly  fading  eﬀects  of  the  alcohol  she  had 
consumed bolstered her conﬁdence. Dammit, she thought to 
herself, she might be ﬂat-chested, but she was still beautiful, 
and as she heard his answer a second later, she felt her heart 
skip a beat as they set oﬀ toward her house. </p>
<p>Their jackets brushed together as they walked, and though 
she  savoured  the  closeness  of  him  beside  her,  she  couldn’t 
help  but  become  a  little  distracted  by  the  faint  jiggling  in  her 
chest.  With  her  bra  stuﬀed  like  normal  –  her  real  boobs 
pushed  tightly  together  –  there  wasn’t  normally  much 
movement  to  them  when  she  moved.  Now  however,  and 
though  admittedly  only  slight,  there  was  deﬁnite  movement. 
She stole a glance downward, and almost tripped as her gaze 
became  momentarily  stuck  on  her  chest.  There  was  no 
mistaking it: Though in reality it was only slight, her cleavage 
had  grown  a  couple  of  centimetres  longer,  the  additional 
material  in  her  bra  pushing  her  real  breasts  upward  so  that 
they  were  starting  to  spill  out  from  the  soft  purple  fabric, 
creating a faint bulge where her bra met her top. </p>
<p>Reaching  her  house,  her  hands  trembling  faintly,  she </p>
<p>opened the door. </p>
<p>‘What  can  I  get  you  to  drink?’  she  asked  as  she  showed 
him  into  her  small  home.  Though  she  wasn’t  sure,  she 
suspected the layout was identical to his own. Standing in the </p>
<p>lounge  –  his  own  house  visible  through  the  open  curtains  – 
she saw him take it all quickly in. </p>
<p>Whilst avoiding a cluttered appearance, she’d managed to 
squeeze  a  nice  amount  of  furniture  into  the  modest  room. 
Along  one  side,  her  plush  two-seater  sofa  sat  angled  toward 
the TV unit whilst along the other, and positioned to look out 
over  the  small  marina  inlet,  was  her  chaise  lounge.  Sideless, 
with  a  double  curve  that  allowed  her  to  lie  back  with  her 
laptop  perched  on  her  raised  legs,  it  oﬀered  her  a  relaxing 
view of the harbour and the sea when she worked from home. 
Though tonight she had other plans for it. </p>
<p>‘I’ll  just  have  another  beer  if  you’re  sure  that’s  okay?’  he 
replied to her insistence that she had plenty of drinks to oﬀer 
him.  Nodding  and  smiling,  she  didn’t  mention  the  fact  that 
she’d deliberately been out and bought several diﬀerent types 
– all to make him feel more at home. </p>
<p>Leaving him momentarily alone in the lounge, she stood in 
the kitchen for a moment, simply staring down at her bust. It 
was  now  deﬁnitely  larger  still.  With  her  padding  pushing  her 
swollen  breasts  upward  and  outward  even  further,  it  was 
starting  to  look  a  little  silly  –  perhaps  even  betraying  the  fact 
that  she  was  a  stuﬀer.  Keeping  her  ears  pricked  in  case  he 
followed  her,  she  reached  quickly  down  into  her  bra  and 
removed a couple of the ﬁllets she had placed there. Weighing 
up  her  appearance  again,  she  couldn’t  help  but  grin  at  the 
realisation that her cleavage was now almost identical to how 
it had looked at the start of the evening – yet without most of 
the stuﬃng.</p>
<p>She couldn’t tell if he noticed a change as she handed him 
his  beer  back  in  the  lounge.  She  had  set  the  lighting  in  the 
room  carefully  –  aiming  for  atmospheric  rather  than  simply... 
dark.  The  choice  of  music  too  was  very  speciﬁc;  nothing 
overly romantic, but not loud and intrusive either. </p>
<p>She settled on the sofa beside him, angling her whole body 
toward  him  as  she  tucked  her  legs  up  underneath  herself. 
Smoothing  out  the  front  of  her  relatively  short  skirt,  she 
watched him take a sip of his drink.</p>
<p>‘Oh,’  she  said  with  a  grin,  ‘that  embarrassing  stuﬀ  I  was </p>
<p>telling you about earlier...?’</p>
<p>She  reached  for  her  phone,  her  pulse  quickening.  The 
alcohol  was  quickly  wearing  oﬀ  and  she  felt  her  nerve 
wavering.  She  should  have  had  another  drink.  Quickly 
opening her photos, she pretended to search for the right one. 
In reality, she’d already lined up a deliberate selection.</p>
<p>‘I know a lot of people think it’s daft and a bit childish,’ she 
said, holding out her phone, ‘but it’s a great opportunity to get 
creative  and  be  artistic,  and  I  love  the  fact  that  no-one  really 
knows who I am. I can be anyone I want.’</p>
<p>Gesturing for him to take her phone, she watched his face 
closely  for  a  reaction  to  the  recent  photograph  of  herself  at 
Comic-Con. Her skintight outﬁt highlighted the few curves her 
body had to oﬀer, the high-neck design having allowed her to 
stuﬀ her bra to the max.</p>
<p>‘No,  I  think  it’s  great,’  he  said  with  a  chuckle  –  aimed,  it 
seemed, at her feigned embarrassment rather than the photo. 
‘I’ve never really gotten into it enough to claim I’m a huge fan, 
but I used to read the odd comic book when I was a kid and 
I’m a huge fan of the ﬁlms now.’</p>
<p>Grinning, she gestured for him to swipe through to the next 
photo,  her  hand  brushing  his  leg  as  she  did  so,  and  her 
insides  squirming  in  delight  as  she  watched  him  zoom  in  on 
her in the next picture. Whilst he hadn’t zoomed directly onto 
her chest, he wasn’t far oﬀ. </p>
<p>He  scrolled  again,  and,  perfectly  on  cue,  she  feigned 
embarrassment  as  the  next  image  slid  into  view.  Essentially 
wearing  nothing  but  booty  shorts  and  a  boob  tube  –  which 
was,  once  again,  stuﬀed  to  create  the  impression  of  a 
generous  amount  of  boob  lurking  within  the  taught  fabric  – 
she  might  as  well  have  been  wearing  a  bikini.  Unlike  the 
others,  this  one  had  been  taken  in  a  hotel  room,  and  had  all 
the hallmarks of a more private photo. </p>
<p>‘Oops, sorry –,’</p>
<p>‘It’s  ﬁne,’  she  said  quickly,  taking  the  oﬀered  phone  back </p>
<p>as she allowed her hand to momentarily linger against his.</p>
<p>Swiping along to the next image, she chuckled. </p>
<p>‘That’s our little group at the last one,’ she said, turning the 
screen toward him. She leaned forward, her hair brushing his 
face as she lowered herself until they were sitting only inches 
apart. Her folded legs, pressed against his. </p>
<p>She watched him closely as he looked at the image. It had 
been  carefully  selected,  and  showed  a  line  of  six  or  seven 
young woman, including her, standing in the middle of a large, 
bustling hall. Like her, all were wearing costumes that ﬂaunted 
their  ﬁgures,  and,  without  fail,  all  of  them  were  considerably 
curvier  than  she.  Boobs  spilled  from  elaborate  costumes  as 
hips and bums ﬂared out at the waist. Two of the women fell 
ﬁrmly into the BBWs category, and even as she looked at the 
image  now  she  found  herself  envious  of  the  canyon  of 
cleavage one of them had on show.</p>
<p>‘The costumes are amazing,’ he said, a little hesitantly, his 
gaze  jumping  around  the  image  as  he  clearly  struggled  to 
determine what was an appropriate compliment to pay them.</p>
<p>He  turned  his  attention  away  from  the  screen,  smiling 
across  the  small  gap  between  them  as  they  sat  in  close 
proximity.  Reaching  out,  she  rested  her  hand  on  his  forearm, 
her  ﬁngers  gently  caressing  his  skin.  Her  heart  was 
hammering  in  her  chest,  and  she  saw  his  gaze  dart  quickly 
from the phone to her chest and then back to her eyes. Taking 
a  quick,  nervously  excited  breath,  she  felt  an  unusual 
tightness once again present in her bra, and it took all she had<br />
not  to  look  down.  Fixing  her  attention  on  him  instead,  she 
noticed him shift slightly toward her, his body leaning into her 
a little more as he smiled at her. </p>
<p>‘You know,’ she said as she took her phone and switched 
the  screen  oﬀ.  She  glanced  wistfully  away  for  a  moment,  ‘I 
have to admit that I do ﬁnd myself rather jealous of a lot of the 
girls that I meet...’</p>
<p>She trailed oﬀ as she nodded toward her phone. </p>
<p>‘Why?’ he asked, his curiosity genuine.</p>
<p>‘Well,’  she  said,  feeling  her  face  ﬂush  as  her  whole  body 
began  to  feel  suddenly  hot,  ‘I’ve  just  always  wanted  to  be  a 
bit curvier, you know...?’</p>
<p>She hung her head for a moment, using the gesture to steal 
a  glance  at  her  chest.  Her  heart  pounded  as  she  saw  a  new 
surge  of  cleavage  pushing  its  way  out  of  her  halter  top.  No 
wonder  her  top  was  feeling  tight  –  whilst  a  small  amount  of 
additional stuﬃng remained inside her padded bra, her chest 
was looking larger than it ever had. </p>
<p>‘Aw,  but  you’re  stunning,’  he  said  opposite  her,  his  own 
appearance  seemingly  a  little  ﬂustered,  though  he  quickly 
appeared  to  pull  himself  together.  ‘You’re  staggeringly 
beautiful... and you do have curves.’</p>
<p>Even  as  she  ﬂashed  him  her  best  smile,  she  caught  him 
steal a glance at her chest, and as her gaze returned to meet 
his, she was sure she saw a sudden tightness to the front of 
his  jeans.  She  took  a  deep  breath,  the  constricted  sensation 
around her chest intensifying. </p>
<p>It had to be him, she thought to herself. There could surely 
be  no  doubt.  It  was  impossible  otherwise.  Well  –  it  was 
impossible either way but –</p>
<p>Fuck it, she decided. If this wasn’t the opportunity she had </p>
<p>been waiting for, she’d never do it. </p>
<p>‘You know,’ she said slowly and coyly, ‘there is something I </p>
<p>could should, if you’d like?’</p>
<p>The pounding in her ears was almost deafening, and even 
as she saw him simply begin to nod, she scrambled quickly to 
her feet and ﬂed the room. </p>
<p>Having  sprinted  as  quietly  as  possible  up  the  stairs  to  her 
bedroom,  she  stood  in  the  darkness,  panting  slightly.  The 
sensation  of  her  bra  digging  into  her  sides  was  intoxicating, 
and  as  she  tore  her  clothes  oﬀ  and  kicked  them  under  the 
bed,  she  stood  naked  for  a  moment,  her  dainty  hands 
reaching tentatively upward. When she found her breasts, her 
nipples  almost  agonisingly  erect,  she  couldn’t  help  but  gasp. 
Whilst they weren’t as large as she had hoped, she could not 
deny the fact that they were bigger. Taking them into her warm 
hands,  she  squeezed  them  gently,  quickly  biting  her  lip  to 
suppress a moan as she wondered what size they might now 
be. </p>
<p>At least a C cup, surely.</p>
<p>She  crossed  her  legs  where  she  stood,  massaging  the 
swollen  ﬂesh  within  her  hands  as  she  felt  herself  grow  wet 
between her thighs.</p>
<p>Behind her in her cupboard, her “surprise” waited patiently, 
and  it  took  an  awful  lot  of  willpower  for  her  to  let  herself  go 
and turn to put it on. </p>
<p>‘What  do  you  think?’  she  called  as  she  headed  back 
downstairs  a  minute  later.  She  had  tied  her  hair  up  in  a  tight 
ponytail, and as she bounded down the hallway barefoot she 
enjoyed  the  new  and  utterly  wonderful  sensation  of  a  slight 
jiggle to her slightly larger tits. </p>
<p>Her plan worked as she had hoped, the sound of her voice 
and her question getting him to his feet and, by the time she 
re-entered  the  room,  he  was  standing  in  the  middle  of  it. 
Thankfully, she noted, he had left his beer by the sofa, as by 
the look on his face, she suspected, he might have otherwise 
dropped it.</p>
<p>Her  face  was  burning  and  her  heart  was  pounding  louder 
than  ever  as  she  took  his  hand  and  pulled  him  toward  the 
window  –  leading  him  to  a  faint  swathe  of  light  cast  into  the 
room from the marina below. </p>
<p>The  costume  was  one  she  had  bought  especially  for  the 
occasion,  and  though  she  had  bought  it  from  a  high  quality 
specialist online – even paying for express delivery to ensure it 
arrived  on  time  –  it  wasn’t  in  the  same  league  as  her  other 
costumes. But that wasn’t really the point. The point, instead, 
was that it was deliberately several sizes too big for her. Whilst 
the elastic fabric – not quite neoprene and not latex like some, 
but more of a stretchy synthetic blend – clung to her in all the 
right  ways,  it’s  initial  impact  wasn’t  quite  the  same  as  a 
correctly  ﬁtted  one  would  have.  Especially  had  she  retained 
her stuﬀed bra.</p>
<p>‘It’s  supposed  to  be  Black  Widow  from  the  Marvel 
universe,’ she said as she stood before him, twisting her hips 
slowly. She pointed out the detailing on the arms and around 
her waist, before glancing down toward her legs.</p>
<p>‘Though I’m not entirely sure why they cut it oﬀ above the </p>
<p>knee,’ she added with a shrug and a lighthearted laugh.</p>
<p>She  looked  back  up  at  him  to  ﬁnd  him  taking  it  all  in 
unapologetically.  Though  the  slightly  baggy  costume  had  a 
deep  V-neck,  she  felt  suddenly  extremely  self-conscious  of 
her unsupported boobs, and, more than ever, prayed that her 
plan was going to pay oﬀ.</p>
<p>‘So,  what  do  you  think?’  she  asked  seductively,  still 
swaying  slightly  as  she  stepped  forward,  pressing  her  lower 
body  against  his  as  she  placed  her  hands  around  his  waist. </p>
<p>Any doubt as to the origin of the bulge in the front of his jeans 
disappeared as she looked up at him, wondering momentarily 
whether he’d be able to feel her racing heartbeat.</p>
<p>Shaking  his  head  a  little  and  stiﬂing  a  chuckle,  he  looked </p>
<p>down at her. </p>
<p>‘You  look  incredible,’  he  said  earnestly,  his  large  hands 
settling  around  her  waist  as  he  spoke  and  giving  her  a  faint 
squeeze. ‘I –,’</p>
<p>For  a  moment  he  seemed  a  little  lost  for  words,  and  she 
wondered  if  he  was  feeling  at  all  suspicious.  Or  perhaps 
whether, somehow, this was all feeding into a plan of his own.</p>
<p>‘Okay,’ she said simply, ‘I have a confession.’</p>
<p>She  took  his  hand  as  he  laughed,  and,  though  gently, 
manoeuvred  him  very  deliberately  down  onto  the  chaise 
lounge behind them. Before he could question her, she helped 
him shift his legs up and onto the soft fabric until he was half 
sitting, half lying on the chair. As he ﬁnally did open his mouth 
to  speak,  she  quickly  stretched  her  leg  over  and,  turning  to 
face him, sat down astride him, her bum resting on his thighs. </p>
<p>‘This  is  a  very  strange  confession,’  he  mused  as  she 
grinned at him a little guiltily. Due to the raised kink, mid-chair, 
she  was  actually  sat  a  little  higher  than  him,  his  head  resting 
on the reclined back of the chaise as he looked at her.</p>
<p>‘So,’ she said, placing her hands on his thighs and running 
them  slowly  away  from  her  and  toward  the  unmistakable 
bulge  in  his  jeans,  her  thumbs  coming  to  rest  mere 
centimetres from the taut denim. ‘I really hope you don’t mind, 
but my confession is that I saw you on Monday evening.’</p>
<p>She  massaged  his  thighs  gently  as  she  watched  him.  For 
several  moments,  the  smile  remained  –  albeit  with  an  air  of 
confusion.  And  then  she  saw  it  dawn  on  him.  A  fascinating 
range  of  emotions  ﬂashed  across  his  face  as  he  began  to 
decipher and truly understand what she was saying; what she 
meant. </p>
<p>‘You  know,  I’ve  had  a  great  evening,’  she  said  earnestly, 
shifting  slightly  closer  and  running  her  hands  dangerously 
close  to  his  crotch.  ‘I’ve  honestly  had  a  great  evening 
and...regardless of whatever else might still happen...’</p>
<p>She  grinned  at  him,  her  heart  still  pounding  away  in  her </p>
<p>ears as she urged him to speak.</p>
<p>‘I just...’</p>
<p>She glanced down to her chest, her breasts lost in the large </p>
<p>costume despite their new-found size.</p>
<p>‘You  really  are  beautiful,’  he  said  ﬁnally,  his  tone  earnest. 
Reaching out, he placed his hands on her slender thighs and 
gave them a gentle squeeze.  </p>
<p>‘Thank you,’ she replied quickly, ‘but –,’</p>
<p>‘No, I know,’ he said quickly, nodding faintly as he tried to </p>
<p>hold back the beginning of a smile. </p>
<p>‘Can you...help me?’ she asked, her voice little more than a 
whisper.  Leaning  slightly  further  forward,  she  ran  her  hands 
slowly  up  his  thighs  and,  ﬁnally,  onto  the  bulge  on  his  jeans. 
Feeling  the  rock  solid  erection  beneath,  and  listening  to  the 
suddenly ragged sound of his breathing, she whispered in his 
ear. </p>
<p>‘I’ll make it worth it.’</p>
<p>She  kissed  his  neck  softly  as  her  hand  massaged  the </p>
<p>throbbing mass beneath her delicate ﬁngers. </p>
<p>When she sat back up, she saw a smile spread across his </p>
<p>face, and every part of her began to tingle.</p>
<p>‘I might be able to help a little,’ he said, pausing a moment </p>
<p>before adding, ‘you really saw everything on Monday?’</p>
<p>Her  whole  body  ﬂushed  as  she  replayed  it  instantly  in  her 
head,  heat  coursing  through  her  as  she  felt  herself  grow  wet 
once  again.  Still  leaning  forward,  she  felt  her  nipples  press 
against the soft material of her suit. </p>
<p>She nodded. </p>
<p>‘You  can  control  it?’  she  asked,  her  own  smile  growing </p>
<p>uncontrollably as he nodded. </p>
<p>‘You can control what grows?’</p>
<p>He seemed to contemplate his answer with a little diﬃculty </p>
<p>as she continued to stroke him through his jeans. </p>
<p>‘I can sort of channel it,’ he said, ‘with my hands.’</p>
<p>She felt a ﬂutter run the length of her body as she became </p>
<p>much more aware of his ﬁngers squeezing her thighs. </p>
<p>‘I  can  make  really  small  changes  without  touching  at  all, </p>
<p>but it’s most eﬀective if I...’</p>
<p>He  squeezed  her  thighs  a  little  harder  and  she  let  slip  an 
involuntarily  gasp.  Sliding  herself  forward,  she  pressed  her </p>
<p>crotch  ﬁrmly  against  his  and,  ever-so-slowly,  began  to  move 
her hips back and forth against him. </p>
<p>‘So... you can make my boobs bigger?’ she asked, unable 
to see his face as she once again kissed his neck. She felt his 
hands move to her arse, and squeeze it through her suit. </p>
<p>Was he doing anything now? 
‘Yeah, I can,’ he muttered as she continued to grind against </p>
<p>She sat up just enough to look at him.</p>
<p>‘Can you make them really big?’ she asked. </p>
<p>‘Yes,’ he said softly, nodding faintly.</p>
<p>‘Will  they  stay  big?’  she  asked,  drinking  in  the  arousal  on </p>
<p>him. </p>
<p>his face. </p>
<p>‘Pretty much,’ he replied. ‘The only way I know to undo it is </p>
<p>to just have a cold shower and, sort of, will it...’</p>
<p>She digested the information, her own breathing shallow as </p>
<p>her body burned with desire.</p>
<p>‘So  we  could  make  them  huge?’  she  replied,  closing  her 
eyes  as  she  concentrated  on  the  bulge  of  his  dick  rubbing 
against her soaking crotch. </p>
<p>‘Uh  huh,’  he  replied,  his  hands  squeezing  her  arse  and </p>
<p>pulling her ﬁrmly against him. </p>
<p>‘And  one  last  question,’  she  whispered  into  his  ear,  ‘I  saw </p>
<p>you grow too.’</p>
<p>She felt him smile as she brushed her face on his. </p>
<p>‘How does that work?’</p>
<p>Beside her, he chuckled darkly.</p>
<p>‘Well, you saw what made it grow,’ he said simply. ‘And it’ll 
just keep growing that way until it... until it gets used in other 
ways.’</p>
<p>The excitement coursing through her was almost too much. </p>
<p>Her patience was almost at its limit.</p>
<p>‘Though,’  he  added  quickly,  ‘if  you  do  that,  I  can’t  really 
control  which  part  of  you  changes.  But  I  can,  sort  of,  edit  it 
after... the other way.’</p>
<p>Leaning back, she looked at him, a hunger erupting in the 
pit of her stomach as she suddenly saw his own desire staring 
back at her.</p>
<p>Shifting  herself  up  and  oﬀ  him,  she  pivoted  her  leg  back 
across  the  chaise  and,  with  his  help,  stripped  his  shirt  and </p>
<p>jeans  from  his  muscular  body.  Fumbling  in  her  excitement, 
she  ﬁnally  took  his  boxer  shorts  and  threw  them  to  the  ﬂoor, 
turning  back  to  survey  his  naked,  muscular  form  in  the  faint 
ray of light from outside. His nine, maybe even ten, inch cock 
stood  proud,  waiting  for  her,  and,  as  he  watched,  she  knelt 
down  on  the  soft  carpet  beside  him.  Running  a  hand  slowly 
up  and  down  his  cock,  she  lowered  her  head  and  took  him 
into her mouth.</p>
<p>Above  her,  she  heard  him  exhale  as  she  moved  slowly  up 
and down, surprised by the sweet taste of him in her mouth. It 
was  unexpectedly  enticing,  and  with  each  passing  second 
she  found  herself  enjoying  it  more  and  more.  Drinking  in  the 
sound of his shallow breathing above her, she wondered what 
the  result  of  her  actions  would  be.  She  recalled  the  memory, 
burned  into  her  mind,  of  the  woman  she’d  seen  across  the 
marina  several  nights  before,  and  suddenly  she  became 
aware of just how wet she was; how furiously hard her nipples 
had become inside the slightly gaping suit.</p>
<p>She  felt  him  twitch  inside  her  mouth,  her  excitement  and 
eagerness  bringing  him  to  the  edge  far  faster  than  she  had 
expected. All but squirming in anticipation, she braced herself, 
her  pulse  bounding  once  again.  And  then,  with  only  the 
slightest  of  warnings,  she  felt  him  explode  inside  her  mouth. 
Swallowing  with  ease  –  even  enjoying  the  unusual,  almost 
addictive  taste  –  she  felt  his  energy  ﬂow  into  her  like  a  hot 
drink  on  a  cold  day.  Only  it  was  spreading  to  more  than  her 
stomach.  She  swallowed  and  swallowed  as  the  ﬂush  spread 
throughout her body, her thighs growing hotter and slicker as 
she  closed  her  eyes  and  allowed  the  myriad  of  sensations 
erupting  all  over  her  body  to  ﬁnd  their  way  to  her  brain’s 
pleasure centre.</p>
<p>As  his  orgasm  began  to  subside,  she  slowed,  gently 
massaging  him  with  her  lips  as  she  listened  to  him  moan 
softly.  And  then  she  felt  it:  A  sudden  tension  in  her  bum,  a 
sense  of  the  suit  moving  against  her  skin.  Her  waist  too  was 
growing a little. Up top, she felt the suit graze her nipples, and 
she  faltered  momentarily  as  a  wave  of  pleasure  ran  from  her 
breasts to her soaking groin. </p>
<p>But then, inside her mouth, she felt him begin to swell. At 
ﬁrst  she  thought  he  was  simply  beginning  to  recover,  but  it </p>
<p>wasn’t  long  until  she  realised  it  was  something  else.  He  had 
grown  larger  than  before,  once  again  rigid  inside  her  mouth. 
Even as she longed to straddle him and take him deep within 
her,  she  doubled  down  and  began  to  bob  her  head  up  and 
down.  Within  the  suit  she  felt  her  swollen  tits  jiggle  slightly, 
and though she longed to look, she forced herself to focus on 
him.</p>
<p>I  won’t  let  him  go  until  we’re  both  huge,  she  thought  to </p>
<p>herself, her mind running wild with what might be possible. </p>
<p>Manoeuvring  herself  up  a  little,  tightening  her  lips  as  she 
ran them up and down the length of him, she tried to take as 
much  of  him  as  she  could.  Above  her,  she  heard  him  gasp, 
and  a  second  later  his  hips  bucked.  As  a  pulsating  torrent 
erupted from him once again, she tried desperately to swallow 
every last drop, a ﬁre erupting in her stomach and spreading 
quickly to every part of her.</p>
<p>Once again she felt the suit constrict around her bum and 
her thighs, the waistline growing a little less slack. For the ﬁrst 
time, she felt her nipples make contact with the inside lining of 
the  stretchy  fabric  and  stay  there  –  no  longer  hanging 
pathetically inside the baggy suit as they grew into swollen D 
cups. As she leaned in, refusing to stop for even a moment as 
she  struggled  to  swallow  each  enormous  mouthful,  she  felt 
her tummy begin to press softly against the side of the chaise. 
Her  mind,  darting  rapidly  between  all  sorts  of  dark,  lustful 
thoughts,  momentarily  pictured  her  second  most  favourite 
erotic  anime  where  the  men  all  featured  enormous,  bulging, 
cocks. </p>
<p>In total, and oﬀering no respite against the endless waves 
of mounting pleasure, she brought him to orgasm eight times. 
Out  of  view  above  her,  she  could  hear  him  panting  weakly, 
unable  to  catch  as  his  breath  as  he  lay  almost  powerless  to 
stop her as her obsession grew more and more tangible. </p>
<p>After each time, as more and more of his delicious energy 
ﬂowed  from  him,  his  entire  body  bucking  and  quivering,  she 
slowed  for  only  a  moment  as  his  cock  continued  to  swell, 
unable to tell if he was begging her to stop or continue. </p>
<p>But  she  didn’t  care  –  each  almost  seismic  eruption  ﬁlling 
her with a torrent of ﬂuid that only made her hungrier for more. </p>
<p>She  was  immersed  in  her  own  little  bubble,  the  only  thing 
penetrating it the monster that she continued, with increasing 
diﬃculty, to take into her mouth. Every part of her body tingled 
and  burnt  with  a  ﬁre  that  spread  from  her  stomach  to  her 
soaking  thighs  and  indeed  everywhere  else.  It  wouldn’t  take 
much  for  her  to  orgasm  right  there  and  then,  the  relentless 
waves  of  pleasure  washing  over  her  making  her  tremble  and 
requiring  a  great  deal  of  concentration  to  stop  from 
overcoming her completely. </p>
<p>It wasn’t time yet! 
It was diﬃcult though. Oh so diﬃcult.</p>
<p>Though she could no longer ﬁt much more than the head of 
his  staggeringly  engorged  penis  inside  her  mouth,  she  had 
taken every last drop of him within her, moaning and writhing 
almost uncontrollably as she felt it take it’s eﬀect. </p>
<p>Though  she  longed  more  than  anything  for  enormous, 
bulging  and  burgeoning  breasts,  she  had  not  expected  the 
level  of  pleasure  she  was  deriving  from  the  sensation  of 
growth  taking  place  all  over  her  body.  Though  she  was, 
undoubtedly, biding her time until she could feel the grasp of 
his  powerful  hands  around  her  tits  as  they  grew  larger  and 
larger,  she  had,  in  the  meantime,  held  herself  on  the  brink  of 
orgasm  as  his  energy  poured  ﬂesh  into  her  once  lithe  and 
slender body.</p>
<p>Her  once  ﬂat  and  shapeless  rear  had  swollen  and 
expanded  in  every  direction.  Stretching  out  the  lower  half  of 
her Black Widow suit, she had felt ﬂesh pour steadily into her 
thighs  and  arse,  her  hips  growing  broader  and  ﬂeshier  until 
she had eventfully felt the swell of her arse press into the new 
curves of her calves as she kneeled beside the chaise lounge. </p>
<p>Having  taken  in  what  seemed  like  gallon  upon  gallon,  she 
had  felt  her  stomach  grow  too,  ever  hungry  for  more  as  she 
swallowed  greedily  and  increasingly  frantically.  Billowing  out 
before  her,  expanding  above  and  onto  her  thick  and  meaty 
thighs, she had felt the soft ﬂesh of her belly push against the 
side of the chaise with increasing fervour.</p>
<p>One size ﬁts all – the advert for the cheap stretchy costume </p>
<p>had said – from size 8 to size 18. </p>
<p>Well,  she  thought  to  herself,  feeling  the  taught  fabric 
stretch around her waist and around the bulge of her bloated 
stomach, she was going to see about that!</p>
<p>Then there were her breasts; the main reason she was now 
bracing  herself  for  the  ninth  and  ﬁnal  eruption  before,  ﬁnally, 
she  would  ride  her  captor  until  her  tits  were  so  big  she’d 
barely be able to stand. Though her target was still a long way 
oﬀ,  she  knew  without  looking  that  they  were  already 
magniﬁcent. Constrained by her costume, they had grown out 
in  every  direction  as  they  had  expanded;  slowly  at  ﬁrst,  yet 
with  increasing  speed  as  she  continued  to  work  her  own 
magic  on  his  swollen  cock.  Now,  they  protruded  from  her 
chest  like  two  conﬁned  basketballs,  spilling  around  to  her 
sides and, in the middle where they met, billowing out through 
the deep V-neck of her suit in an incredibly, bulging display of 
cleavage. With nowhere left to go, they had then worked their 
way downward too, coming to rest on her bulbous stomach.</p>
<p>Pressing  her  swollen  body  against  the  side  of  the  chaise, 
she felt him begin to orgasm one last time, the new weight of 
her body pulling her forward as she tried to take in the torrent 
bursting out of him. Her belly pressed almost painfully into the 
side  of  the  chair  as  she  kept  her  hands  wrapped  tightly 
around his pulsating shaft, determined not to let even a single 
drop  escape.  In  the  space  between  her  outstretched  arms, 
she  was  aware  of  her  tits  ballooning  once  more.  Shimmying 
forward  a  little,  her  whole  body  jiggling  inside  the  over-
stretched fabric, she felt her breasts come to rest against the 
soft material of the chair, spilling out forwards and sidewards 
against the side of his body.</p>
<p>As  he  ﬁnally  ﬁnished,  she  released  him,  gasping  for  air  as 
she kneeled beside him, her eyes closed as she fought oﬀ an 
orgasm of her own. Her whole body tingled and throbbed with 
desperate  desire,  her  nipples  painfully  erect  as  they  pushed 
against  the  taught  material  stretched  tightly  across  her  bust. 
Between  her  plump  thighs,  squashed  together  as  she  knelt, 
she felt soaked fabric rub softly against her.</p>
<p>Finally, it was time.</p>
<p>Balancing  her  new  weight  carefully,  she  climbed  slowly  to 
her feet. There was not a single place on her body where the </p>
<p>costume  was  not  completely  taught.  Reaching  around,  she 
ran  her  hands  up  her  enormous  thighs  until  she  reached  her 
arse,  moaning  softly  as  she  sunk  her  ﬁngers  into  the  soft 
ﬂesh.  Continuing  upward  and  around,  she  massaged  her 
massive, spherical belly. Having lost some of it’s deﬁnition as 
it ballooned, the fabric of her costume had helped it to retain a 
near  perfect  shape,  and  she  bit  her  lip  as  she  ran  her  hands 
over it. Though she had no frame of reference, this was surely 
what  it  must  feel  like  to  be  pregnant,  she  thought.  Not  that 
she could see much of it, though.</p>
<p>She trembled with excitement as her hands continued their 
journey  north,  and  onto  the  now  translucent  black  fabric. 
From her perspective, her incredible tits were now simply one 
enormous  explosion  of  ﬂesh  pushing  out  from  her  chest  in 
every direction. Sinking her ﬁngers into the soft ﬂesh through 
the  taut  material,  she  cried  out  as  pleasure  coursed  through 
her.</p>
<p>She couldn’t wait any more.</p>
<p>Reaching  down,  her  ﬁngers  trembling,  she  found  the 
waistband  stretched  to  its  limit  around  her  broad  hips. 
Matching  the  same  black  fabric  of  her  costume,  the  booty 
shorts she was wearing over the top had all but blended in to 
her outﬁt, and the reason for their presence was simple. Ever 
since she had conceived her plan a few days ago, fantasising 
about ballooning up on her neighbours enormous cock as her 
tits grew larger than anything she had ever previously dreamt 
of,  she  had  envisaged  herself  wearing  a  Black  Widow  outﬁt; 
the outﬁt of her secret lesbian crush, Scarlett Johansson.</p>
<p>With  a  little  diﬃcult,  she  removed  the  booty  shorts, 
watching  as  a  devious  smile  crept  over  her  prisoner’s  face: 
The  other  reason  she’d  bought  this  cheaper  outﬁt  for  the 
evening was so she wouldn’t feel so bad when she cut it up a 
little.</p>
<p>Climbing  carefully  onto  the  chaise  lounge  at  it’s  far  end, 
she positioned herself onto all fours above his shins. Despite 
the  fabric  of  her  suit  holding  them  up,  she  felt  the  weight  of 
her  tits  pull  her  down  as  they  settled  heavily  onto  his  bare 
legs.  Before  her,  he  sat  transﬁxed,  his  gaze  glued  on  her 
constricted,  rippling  cleavage  as  she  made  her  way  up  his 
body.  Her  belly,  too,  hung  below  her,  swaying  faintly  as  she </p>
<p>went and grazing his legs as well. Her hips, now several times 
wider  than  they  had  been  before,  bulged  out  behind  her, 
clearly visible either side of her as her enormous arse hung in 
the air; his legs squashed between her ﬂeshy thighs. </p>
<p>Reaching his waist, she pushed her swollen breasts against 
his rock hard erection, the head of his penis above her as the 
monster  stood  fully  erect  before  him.  Manoeuvring  herself  a 
little  cumbersomely  into  a  sitting  position,  she  pressed  her 
bulging belly against his muscular abdomen, the twitching tip 
of his cock disappearing into the eruption of tit ﬂesh beneath 
his chin.</p>
<p>Still  unaccustomed  to  her  new  size,  she  pushed  her  hips 
slowly  forward,  the  base  of  his  penis  pressed  against  her 
soaking pussy through the hole she had cut from the front of 
the  cheap  Black  Widow  costume  and  hidden  with  the  booty 
shorts. Pinned back in the chaise lounge by the weight of her 
body,  she  could  see  from  the  look  in  his  eyes  that  he  too 
wanted nothing more. And so, raising herself up, she took the 
tip  of  his  throbbing  cock  in  her  small,  delicate  hand,  and 
positioned  him  beneath  her,  her  soaking  crotch  hovering  in 
front  of  his  face.  Somehow,  through  all  the  changes  she  had 
experienced,  she  somehow  knew  that  she  would  be  able  to 
take it all within her. But still...</p>
<p>Her  body  began  to  tremble  from  both  the  exertion  of 
holding her new weight above him, and simple, unadulterated 
desire.  She  began  to  lower  herself,  feeling  his  enormous, 
warm  and  wet  head  press  against  her  before,  with  a  faint 
gasp, she took him inside of her.</p>
<p>It  was  unlike  anything  she  had  ever  experienced  before  –
the  sensation  of  his  incredible  girth  gently  stretching  her  as 
she slid more and more of him into her burning body. </p>
<p>Her  eyes  screwed  tightly  shut,  she  felt  him  throb,  her 
swollen  belly  rubbing  against  his  chest  as  she  continued  to 
lower herself onto him. Her body continued to tremble, and a 
moment  later  she  felt  him  place  his  hands  on  the  bulging, 
ﬂeshy  cheeks  of  her  enormous  arse.  Lower  and  lower  she 
went,  his  monstrous  form  ﬁlling  her  from  within  as  she 
moaned  and  shook.  Her  tits,  mammoth  and  quivering  within 
their  stretchy  conﬁnes,  made  contact  with  his  chest,  her 
nipples pulled gently upward as she continued to take him in. </p>
<p>And then her arse made contact with his thighs, and for a 
moment  the  two  simply  sat  there,  motionless,  their  bodies 
teetering  on  the  brink  of  what  would  surely  be  the  most 
powerful orgasm either had ever experienced. </p>
<p>She felt full. In a most intense and satisfying sense that she 
had never experienced before, she felt every inch of her body 
revel  in  its  newfound  form,  the  rigid  form  of  his  gargantuan 
penis within her seemingly pushing her body out from within. 
Pressed  against  him,  her  breasts  and  belly  bulging  out 
sideways  as  they  found  themselves  trapped,  she  found 
herself unwilling to move lest she accidentally succumb to the 
waves of pleasure coursing through her.</p>
<p>‘Listen  to  me  closely,’  she  whispered  in  his  ear,  leaning  in 
as closely as the cleavage surging up between them and her 
belly would allow. </p>
<p>‘I  want  you  to  give  me  the  perfect  butt,’  she  breathed, 
feeling his ﬁngers tighten on her rear as she spoke. ‘Massive 
is ﬁne, but make it massive and perfect and round.’</p>
<p>She failed to contain a whimper as she felt his cock twitch </p>
<p>deep within her.</p>
<p>‘I  don’t  dislike  the  belly  either,’  she  continued,  shimmying 
as much as she dared to illustrate her point, ‘but give it a nice, 
round shape.’</p>
<p>With diﬃculty – her bulging breasts getting in the way – she </p>
<p>gripped his arms tightly. </p>
<p>‘But,  most  importantly,’  she  whispered  darkly,  ‘we’re  not 
leaving  this  chair  until  you’ve  given  me  the  best  tits  I’ve  ever 
seen.’</p>
<p>Amidst his shallow breathing, she felt him grunt faintly, and, </p>
<p>a second later, she felt it.</p>
<p>The  heat  from  his  ﬁngers  erupted  into  the  cheeks  of  her 
butt,  and  immediately  she  felt  herself  begin  to  change. 
Though  she  could  tell  she  wasn’t  growing  larger,  she  felt  the 
ﬂesh in her arse grow ﬁrmer and fuller. It was a vastly diﬀerent 
sense of growth from before, and as she felt him take charge 
and  guide  the  energy  through  her,  she  found  herself  holding 
her breath. It was almost mesmerising, and simply closing her 
eyes  she  succumbed  as  she  felt  her  immense  butt  grow 
tighter and rounder.</p>
<p>Moments later, his large, powerful hands slid onto the sides 
of her belly. This time, as the energy poured in and he began 
to shape her, she felt her breasts begin to grow as some of it 
spilt  over.  Once  again,  she  could  sense  that  whilst  her 
stomach  wasn’t  growing  larger,  per  se,  he  was  ﬁlling  it  up  to 
give  it  the  shape  she  wanted;  the  distance  between  them 
growing  slightly  as  he  turned  the  ﬂabby  shapeless  ﬂesh  into 
an enormous, taught, egg-shaped mountain. </p>
<p>As graciously as she could, she leaned backwards, placing 
her  hands  on  the  side  of  the  chaise  lounge  behind  her. 
Arching her back, she glanced at the fabric of her suit – now 
so  taught  it  surely  had  to  be  nearing  its  limit.  Though  her 
beachball-sized  tits  hid  his  hands  from  view,  she  felt  his 
ﬁngers massaging the ﬂesh of her stomach as it continued to 
press against his despite the fact she was now leaning away.</p>
<p>Finally,  and  as  she  braced  herself  against  the  explosion 
building between her legs, she felt his hands run up and onto 
her tits.</p>
<p>They  settled  there  ﬁrmly,  his  strong  ﬁngers  sinking  deep 
into  the  soft  ﬂesh  which,  conﬁned  within  the  suit,  gave  her 
mammoth tits the appearance of huge water balloons. Within 
her,  she  felt  his  cock  jerk,  and  a  moment  later  she  felt  the 
energy begin to ﬂow from his hands. Gasping and squirming, 
she fought back furiously against her orgasm, unable to keep 
her eyes open as she bit down hard enough on her lower lip 
to draw blood.</p>
<p>Within the costume she felt the pressure build. Like he had 
done  with  her  arse  and  her  stomach,  she  could  feel  him 
channel the growth. Had it not been for the suit, she was sure 
that the growth in her breasts would have resulted in a natural, 
probably  somewhat  sagging  shape  –  their  enormous  weight 
working  against  them.  Now  though,  she  felt  him  pump  ﬂesh 
into what felt like the top of them, as though he was somehow 
given  them  buoyancy  against  gravity.  Though  retaining  a 
natural,  teardrop  appearance,  they  grew  steadily  more 
bulbous,  the  Black  Widow  suit  groaning  audibly  as  her  tits 
began to round out.</p>
<p>As  more  and  more  cleavage  poured  through  the  deep  v-
neck,  they  deﬁed  the  suit’s  pull  as  they  grew  outward  and 
sidewards, ﬁlling the remaining gap between their bodies. </p>
<p>And, ﬁnally, she felt the costume begin to rip. The seam on 
her left shoulder, almost in slow motion, began to unravel, the 
black  fabric  coming  apart  to  reveal  the  pale  skin  of  her 
shoulder.  Even  as  a  surge  of  tit  ﬂesh  began  to  appear,  the 
seam  surrendered  entirely  –  the  whole  front  section  of  her 
costume  growing  slack  as  the  stitching  unravelled  from 
shoulder to shoulder. </p>
<p>Realising what had happened, she felt him hesitate, and for 
a moment his hands disappeared from her chest. With nothing 
to hold it in place, the front section of her costume simply fell 
away, landing silently on the upper swell of her belly.</p>
<p>And, ﬁnally, her tits were free.</p>
<p>For  a  moment,  the  two  of  them  simply  stared.  They  were </p>
<p>perfect.</p>
<p>Largely  defying  gravity,  they  hung  down  just  enough  to 
make them look somehow, incredibly, natural. Rippling faintly 
as her body quivered, the motion served only to highlight their 
enormous shape – each surpassing the size of an overinﬂated 
beachball.  Her  nipples  too  had  grown,  pointing  angrily 
outward in the cool air of her apartment. </p>
<p>Mesmerised, she watched as he lifted his hands and sunk 
them into the mountains of ﬂesh before him. The feeling of his 
skin on hers for the ﬁrst time was like electricity, and she felt 
her hips buck as he began to pour more ﬂesh into her. </p>
<p>Moaning loudly, she rocked her hips again, feeling the rock 
hard  enormity  of  him  swell  within  her.  She  gasped,  the  heat 
from her tits arcing all the way through her from her nipples to 
her  groin.  Her  monstrous  thighs  trembled  as  they  embraced 
his  girth,  and  as  she  heard  herself  whimper  softly,  she 
watched her tits grow before her eyes. Unable to stop herself, 
she  gyrated  her  bulging  body  against  him,  her  raging  lust 
ﬁnally consuming her as she lost all restraint. </p>
<p>‘Bigger,’ she gasped, arching her back further and thrusting 
her chest up and into the air. They were enormous now, their 
weight immense as they approached almost two feet across. </p>
<p>‘We have to cum together,’ she heard him gasp somewhere </p>
<p>beyond the mountains of ﬂesh.</p>
<p>‘Cum  then!’  she  gasped,  her  ﬁngers  clenched  so  tightly 
onto  the  edge  of  the  chaise  they’d  gone  white.  ‘Cum  inside 
me and make even bigger.’</p>
<p>Her own words were the thing that ﬁnally pushed her over </p>
<p>the edge.</p>
<p>The  ﬁrst  surge  of  her  orgasm  was  like  an  electric  shock. 
Every muscle in her body went rigid. Unable to even breathe, 
she  heard  herself  groan  as  the  air  in  her  lungs  was  expelled. 
The second wave was no less intense, and as her eyes rolled 
back,  her  head  fell  backward  until  she  was  staring  at  the 
ceiling.</p>
<p>And then she felt him orgasm.</p>
<p>Already ﬁlling her to an extent beyond anything she would 
ever previously have thought possible, she felt his cock swell 
larger  still,  stretching  her  even  further  as  she  jerked 
uncontrollably. </p>
<p>Then  came  the  eruption,  and  for  a  moment  she  simply </p>
<p>didn’t know if she could take it.</p>
<p>As  her  muscles  remained  rigid,  her  belly  and  breasts 
shuddering and rippling, she felt herself go lightheaded as she 
felt the torrent erupt inside her. Instantly, it was everywhere: in 
her thighs and arse, in her belly and hips, and in her breasts. 
Even  as  her  own  orgasm  continued  to  ravage  her,  her  hips 
bucking uncontrollably, she felt her taught, bulging body begin 
to expand. </p>
<p>From the bottom of her suit where she had cut a hole in the 
crotch, she heard and felt it begin to rip. With a ballooning of 
previously  contained  ﬂesh,  her  perfect  round  arse  erupted 
from  the  black  fabric  and  splurged  out  and  into  his  lap. 
Around her waist, she felt the stretchy fabric reach its elastic 
limit as her belly burgeoned under the sudden, forceful inﬂux 
ﬁlling her like a ﬁre hose. </p>
<p>Even  as  he  lay  beneath  her,  his  breath  coming  in  short, 
sharp  bursts,  she  felt  him  run  his  hands  up  her  broadening 
hips  to  her  expanding  belly.  Even  as  it  began  to  press  ﬁrmly 
against his own, the pressure still growing, she felt him begin 
to channel the energy upward. </p>
<p>Twitching and gasping, her vision wavering, she felt her tits 
swell.  Their  weight  and  their  girth  exploding,  they  surged 
outward as the last remnants of her suit slither to the ﬂoor.</p>
<p>Naked, she sat astride him, thrusting herself against him as 
best as the electricity shooting through her body would allow.<br />
The orgasm had lit her on ﬁre and as her body glistened with </p>
<p>sweat,  she  fought  to  keep  the  lightheadedness  at  bay  and 
savour  every  single  sensation  shooting  her  new,  immense 
body.</p>
<p>Her  magniﬁcent  belly  pinned  him  ﬁrmly  into  the  chaise 
lounge  as  her  ballooning  breasts  surged  to  ﬁll  the  remaining 
space between them. They were almost the size of small yoga 
balls  now,  and  though  she  could  also  see  them  in  her 
peripheral vision as she leaned yet further backward to make 
way  for  their  growth,  she  felt  their  enormous  form  pressing 
against  her  stomach  and  pressing  against  her  sides  as  they 
grew.</p>
<p>Even as her orgasm began to fade, she felt a second wash 
over her with all the subtlety of a tsunami, her vision fading as 
she  fought  for  breath,  aware  of  her  tits  beginning  to  press 
ﬁrmly against his chest.</p>
<p>Beneath  her,  having  pumped  himself  into  her  for  over  a 
minute,  she  ﬁnally  felt  his  orgasm  begin  to  subside.  With  her 
nipples  squashed  tightly  against  his  abdomen,  she  felt  her 
growth begin to slow too.</p>
<p>Manoeuvring  her  hands  carefully,  and  leaving  one  to  prop 
herself  up,  she  brought  the  other  around  to  explore  her  new 
body.</p>
<p>Lifting  her  head,  she  took  in  the  sight  before  her  as  her 
hand  kneaded  the  taught  mountain  of  tit  ﬂesh  bulging  out 
between them.</p>
<p>Slowly,  a  smile  spreading  across  her  face,  she  began  to </p>
<p>laugh.</p>
<p>Echo I</p>
<p>by Goldleaf </p>
<p>He had bumped into her two days ago in town. Though he 
had seen on Facebook that she had moved into the area, he 
deﬁnitely  hadn’t  expected  to  run  into  her  so  soon.  Walking 
along the high street, he had turned at the sound of someone 
calling  his  name,  and  had  come  face  to  face  with  his  ex-
girlfriend,  a  broad  smile  lighting  up  her  face  as  she  stood 
opposite him. </p>
<p>‘Long time, no see,’ she had said with a raised eyebrow.</p>
<p>He had studied her face as he replied, thinking back to the 
amicable ending of their relationship several years before, and 
the  numerous  times  since  when  he  had  wondered  quietly  to 
himself whether she was the one that had got away. </p>
<p>Trying not to be too obvious about it, he checked her out. 
Her  long  brown  hair  was  mixed  with  professional-looking 
highlights,  and  cascaded  over  her  shoulders  as  their  breath 
rose between them in the cold winter air. Beyond that, and the 
minimal make-up she wore, her thick coat made it diﬃcult for 
him  to  see  much  more.  She  had  always  been  petite  –  her 
appearance almost mousy – her slender ﬁgure ﬁtting her 5’6” 
frame  and  her  somewhat  quiet  and  reserved  persona.  Today, 
however,  she  seemed  full  of  a  new  conﬁdence,  her  height 
bolstered by a pair of black boots with a substantial heel. He 
quickly  traced  the  outline  of  her  jean-clad  legs  until  they 
disappeared behind the lower hem of her jacket. She went to 
the gym – he had seen that on Facebook too – and though her 
legs were lean, there was a new, gentle curve to them. </p>
<p>The two of them had chatted for several minutes, catching 
up  on  each  other’s  lives  with  genuine  interest.  On  several 
occasions, he had been tempted to ask out for a coﬀee, but, 
ultimately,  the  right  moment  hadn’t  arrived,  and  suddenly  he<br />
had found himself saying goodbye. </p>
<p>Taking  a  step  forward,  she  had  wrapped  her  arms  around<br />
him in a farewell hug, and as her body pressed against him he 
had felt the faint impression of her breasts through the layers 
of their coats. Matching the rest of her, and recalling her perky </p>
<p>B-cups from the year or so they had dated, he suspected that 
they remained much the same as they always had done. And 
as  he  reached  out  and  placed  his  arms  around  her  in 
response, he couldn’t help himself.</p>
<p>The two of them had parted, and he smiled down at her as 
she  said  a  ﬁnal  farewell  and  turned  away.  She  hadn’t  felt  a 
thing – and neither had he really; just a faint and ﬂeeting pulse 
that  faded  as  quickly  as  it  had  originated  in  his  ﬁngers  and 
travelled through their coats to her.</p>
<p>He didn’t know where it had all come from – and he didn’t 
question  it  much  either.  As  far  as  he  was  concerned,  this 
strange  ability  he  had  somehow  developed  didn’t  harm 
anyone,  and  it  seemed  extremely  unlikely  that  he’d  ever 
receive answers to any questions he might ask anyway. </p>
<p>But now, two days later, he was about to get an answer to </p>
<p>a related, yet diﬀerent question.</p>
<p>On  the  sofa  beside  him,  the  Facebook  Messenger  app  on 
his  phone  pinged,  and,  with  a  devilish  smile,  he  recognised 
her name. </p>
<p>Claire. </p>
<p>Here we go. 
He opened the chat, returning her greeting and wondering 
whether  she’d  have  the  guts  to  mention  it.  Because  it  was, 
undoubtedly, the sole reason she was messaging him at half-
past nine at night.</p>
<p>He  waited  patiently,  replying  politely  to  her  messages  and 
trying coyly to pretend he couldn’t see she was trying to lead 
the conversation somewhere. </p>
<p>‘So,  do  you  think  I’ve  changed  much  since  we  last  saw </p>
<p>each other?’ she asked him eventually.</p>
<p>He sat up a little straighter on the sofa. </p>
<p>‘I’m  not  sure,’  he  replied  innocently,  ‘we  only  spoke  for  a </p>
<p>minute or so.’</p>
<p>changed much?’</p>
<p>She replied almost instantly with an exasperated emoji. </p>
<p>‘I  meant  physically,’  she  wrote.  ‘Did  you  think  I  had </p>
<p>Well you hadn’t changed much then, he mused, but since… 
‘Your hair was diﬀerent.’ He wrote back. ‘I liked it a lot.’</p>
<p>Her reply was, again, almost instant – and it was clear that </p>
<p>she was still digging for a diﬀerent, very speciﬁc answer.</p>
<p>Deciding to help the conversation – and her – along a little, </p>
<p>he picked his next words carefully, and typed:</p>
<p>‘I  think  you  looked  the  same  the  other  day,  but  you’re  </p>
<p>probably looking a little diﬀerent now.’</p>
<p>This time, there was a pause before she replied. </p>
<p>Somehow  –  through  the  bizarre  ability  he  had  come  to 
possess  and  the  strange  link  it  gave  him  –  he  knew  her 
dreams had, for the last two nights, been ﬁlled with images of 
him; moments between the two of them. </p>
<p>‘How so?’</p>
<p>He  knew  that,  despite  all  logic  to  the  contrary,  she </p>
<p>suspected he knew. Though it was impossible. Wasn’t it?</p>
<p>‘I think there’s a part of you that’s grown a little,’ he typed, </p>
<p>his pulse quickening slightly as he continued to smirk.</p>
<p>This time, there was a signiﬁcant pause before she replied. </p>
<p>‘It was you…?’</p>
<p>In  a  sense,  it  was  an  admission,  and  his  smile  grew. </p>
<p>Shrugging slightly to himself, he decided to just go for it. </p>
<p>‘Your boobs grew, didn’t they?’</p>
<p>An agonising pause, then…</p>
<p>‘Yes! How did you do it? It’s impossible!’</p>
<p>He  chuckled  quietly  to  himself  in  the  cosy  warmth  of  his 
living room. On the opposite wall, a ﬁlm continued on his TV, 
though  he’d  turned  the  volume  down  when  she  had  ﬁrst 
messaged him. </p>
<p>‘I  don’t  know,’  he  replied.  ‘You  get  the  dreams  and  it  just 
happens.  If  you  want  to  ﬁx  it,  go  and  stand  in  the  shower. 
Don’t  touch  them,  just  slowly  turn  the  temperature  down  as 
cold as you can handle.’</p>
<p>He  hit  send  and  watched  as  the  ‘message  received’ </p>
<p>symbol changed to ‘message read’. He waited. </p>
<p>He wondered how much they had grown by. She had been 
a  solid  B-cup  when  they  had  dated,  and  none  of  her  photos 
on  Facebook  or  anything  he’d  seen  the  other  day  had 
suggested  otherwise.  Though  their  hug  had  been  brief,  he 
wondered whether they could have grown a whole cup size.  It 
would  have  had  to  have  been  signiﬁcant  enough  for  her  to 
message him. Though of course there were the dreams too.</p>
<p>If  he  closed  his  eyes,  he  could  almost  picture  her  now 
heading  into  her  bathroom,  removing  her  clothes  and  she 
turned on the tap. She hadn’t replied to his last message, and 
he was sure it was what she was doing.</p>
<p>Did  she  really  mind,  he  wondered.  He  was  fairly  certain 
they’d  had  the  odd  conversation  back  when  they’d  dated 
about things she wouldn’t mind changing about herself.</p>
<p>He saw her standing in the shower, the warm water running 
down  her  trim  body  as  she  reached  for  the  temperature 
control. Even as the ﬁngers on one hand reached out for the 
silver  dial  though,  her  other  hand  reached  up  to  cup  the 
swollen outline of her newly enlarged breast. Her whole body 
shuddered  slightly  as  her  ﬁngers  sunk  in  to  the  soft, 
voluminous  ﬂesh  that  had  spilled  out  of  her  bra  earlier  that 
morning.  Her  eyes  closed  as  her  thumb  and  index  ﬁnger 
surrounded  her  nipple  as  the  rest  of  her  hand  gently 
squeezed.</p>
<p>And that, he knew, would be it. </p>
<p>‘I think I deserve an explanation.’</p>
<p>His  Messenger  app  pinged,  and  the  images  from  his 
almost meditative daydream vanished as he opened his eyes.</p>
<p>‘You live over on the marina, right? Can I come round?’</p>
<p>He  glanced  at  the  clock  on  his  phone.  It  was  gone  ten. 
Thirty  minutes  or  so  was  a  long  time  to  stand  in  a  cold 
shower…</p>
<p>He  gave  her  his  address  and  glanced  around  his  living 
room.  Though  his  two-bedroom  house  wasn’t  exactly  large, 
it’s interior was spacious. Whilst the front door opened onto a 
small,  pedestrianised  boardwalk,  the  rear  patio  doors  beside 
him  opened  onto  a  small  balcony  overlooking  a  small  U-
shaped  bay  of  the  marina.  Across  the  short  distance  – 
currently  devoid  of  boats  thanks  to  the  winter  months  –  he 
could  see  a  handful  of  lights  on  in  the  houses  opposite. 
Preferring  to  admire  the  view  of  the  twinkling  lights,  he  often 
spent the evening with the curtains open, conﬁdent that, with 
only a lamp and his TV illuminating the room, the darkness of 
the night would hide him from view. </p>
<p>The doorbell rang, and he glanced, once again, at the time. </p>
<p>It hadn’t taken her long.</p>
<p>He stood up, walking somewhat excitedly down the dimly-
lit  hallway  toward  the  front  door.  Trying  hard,  he  forced  the 
smile oﬀ his face as he opened the door. </p>
<p>‘Hey,’  he  said  cheerfully,  stepping  quickly  aside  as  she 
didn’t  hesitate  before  brushing  past  him.  Closing  the  door 
behind  her,  he  followed  her  through  to  the  lounge.  From 
behind,  and  in  the  relative  darkness  of  the  hallway,  it  was 
diﬃcult to make out much beyond her silhouette. Her long hair 
was tied back in a ponytail, her upper body hidden by a black 
hoody. He could see her legs though, he noted as he followed 
her  into  the  lounge,  the  pale  skin  of  her  thighs,  then  calves, 
appearing from beneath the hem of a short grey skirt. </p>
<p>‘Can I get you a drink?’ he asked innocently as she came 
to a stop before him. Turning to face him, and lit from the side 
by the light of the lamp, he saw it. Despite the oversized, near-
shapeless  and  decidedly  far-too-large  hoody,  it  was  obvious, 
and  as  he  traced  the  faint  yet  undeniable  swell  beneath  the 
fabric down from her neck toward her navel, he knew exactly 
what had happened in the shower. </p>
<p>With  one  hand  ﬁrmly  grasping  the  shower  controls,  her 
other  had  begun  to  massage  the  larger,  rounder,  heavier 
shape of her swollen breast. Though she had done the exact 
same  thing  earlier  that  morning  when  she  had  awoken, 
soaking  wet,  once  again,  from  another  night  of  sex-ﬁlled 
dreams, it somehow felt diﬀerent, now, under the warm water 
of the shower. </p>
<p>She  closed  her  eyes  as  she  kneaded  and  squeezed  her 
chest,  the  taunt  skin  of  her  breast  spilling  out  between  her 
ﬁngers  as  her  breath  grew  shallow.  Without  any  sort  of 
conscious  decision,  her  other  hand  left  the  temperature 
control and, from her thigh, worked its way between her legs. 
She  gasped  faintly  as  she  began  to  play  with  herself,  her 
swollen  nipple  squeezed  gently  between  her  ﬁngers  as  she 
kneaded her breast.</p>
<p>It  wasn’t  long  before  she  convulsed,  gasped  involuntarily 
as she orgasmed. For the ﬁrst time, her hand left her breast as 
she steadied herself against the shower wall, her eyes closed 
tight  as  she  shuddered,  enjoying  the  sensation  of  the  hot 
water massaging her swollen body.</p>
<p>Eventually  though,  her  breathing  beginning  to  slow,  she 
opened  her  eyes,  and  choked  back  an  involuntary  stutter  of 
surprise. For the past two days she had been living with the all 
but explicable growth of her breasts from her usual size to at 
least  a  proud  C-cup.  Now,  however,  she  saw  as  she  looked 
down  in  shock,  they  had  grown  again  and  by  at  least  the 
same amount. </p>
<p>She watched as they rose and fell, swelling in tandem with 
her  shallow  breathing.  Both  nipples  stood  ﬁrmly  erect,  and 
she  watched  as  a  steady  stream  of  water  cascaded  down 
each, utterly perfect, breast. Curiously, she twisted her upper 
body  sharply,  and  watched,  transﬁxed,  as  they  jiggled  and 
swayed.  And  then,  once  again,  she  had  reached  up  and 
cupped them.</p>
<p>This  time,  her  moans  had  grown  a  little  louder,  and  her 
squeezing  and  kneading  a  little  more  frantic  as  her  hand 
returned,  once  again,  to  between  her  thighs.  She  had 
orgasmed faster too, and harder, and even as she had bucked 
and  gasped,  reaching  out  to  steady  herself,  she  had  opened 
her eyes to see her breasts larger once more. Staggered, she 
had  held  them  in  her  small  hands,  watching  as  only  the 
slightest  squeeze  formed  a  chasm  of  cleavage.  A  moment 
from  last  night’s  dream  pierced  her  body,  and,  as  she 
remembered  the  weight  of  his  body  atop  hers,  she  fought  to 
remain standing as her knees threatened to buckle. Gasping, 
and  spluttering  at  the  water  cascading  down  over  her,  she 
squeezed her swollen breasts and moaned.</p>
<p>He  couldn’t  help  but  stare  as  she  stood  deﬁantly  before 
him. Without speaking, she reached down, grasping the hem 
of  her  hoody  and  pulling  it  up.  Underneath,  he  saw  the  light 
grey material of a t-shirt begin to ride up as she lifted the top 
away. The elasticated band of her short grey skirt dug into her 
narrow hips, he noticed, the beginnings of a muﬃn top spilling 
out  above  it  from  a  surprisingly  soft  little  belly.  As  the  hoody 
continued its journey upward, he felt his heart skip a beat. </p>
<p>How many times had she orgasmed in the shower? 
Her  light  grey  t-shirt  would  normally,  he  suspected,  be  a 
size  too  big  for  her.  It’s  lower  half,  despite  her  tummy,  was<br />
loose, and as it returned to it’s natural position on her body, it </p>
<p>hid  the  ﬂare  of  her  slender  hips  from  view.  But  it  was  up  top 
that his attention was now ﬁxed. </p>
<p>His  ﬁrst  thought,  he  realised  as  he  saw  her  stiﬀ  nipples 
poking  prominently  through  the  taught  cotton,  was  that  she 
wasn’t wearing a bra. Which made sense, as none she owned 
would  surely  ﬁt  her.  As  had  none  of  her  t-shirts  either,  he 
suspected.  Had  they  had  room,  her  magniﬁcent  tits  would 
surely  have  hung  proudly  before  her,  free  to  sway  and  jiggle 
with each minuscule movement she made. In the conﬁnes of 
the only t-shirt she had clearly been able to squeeze them into 
however, he saw that they had simply run out of room.</p>
<p>Though  their  perfect  shape  was  obvious,  they  were  now 
pushed  so  tightly  together  they  could  barely  move,  a  insane 
cleavage  running  from  the  taught  mid-point  of  the  top’s  v-
neck almost all the way down to her navel – at which point the 
t-shirt hung loosely oﬀ her.</p>
<p>‘I, err…</p>
<p>He couldn’t help but chuckle as she threw the hoody to the </p>
<p>ﬂoor beside them.</p>
<p>‘I guess you didn’t turn the temperature down like I said?’</p>
<p>The  obvious  ﬂush  to  her  cheeks  as  he  tore  his  gaze  away 
from  her  sensationally  swollen  breasts  told  him  she  knew  he 
knew what she had done in the shower. </p>
<p>Taking a step forward, her boobs bulging as they jostled up 
and  down  within  her  t-shirt,  she  pressed  herself  against  him. 
Half  expecting  a  slap,  and  caught  somewhat  oﬀ-guard,  he 
opened  his  mouth  to  speak.  But,  before  he  could,  she  had 
leaned  in  and  kissed  him.  It  was  ﬁerce  and  unexpected,  and 
as he felt the incredible swell beneath her t-shirt press against 
him, he stumbled and fell backward. </p>
<p>Somewhat unceremoniously, he landed on his back on the 
elongated section of his sofa where he normally stretched out 
his legs. Looking up, and blinking in surprise, he watched as 
she climbed onto the soft fabric, her knees resting either side 
of  his  waist  as  she  lowered  her  body  towards  his.  First  to 
make  contact  were  her  tits,  squeezed  between  them  as  she 
pressed her crotch against his. Within his jeans, he felt himself 
grow impossibly harder as she grinded herself against him. As 
she  continued  to  kiss  him,  he  reached  up  and  placed  his 
hands  on  her  thighs,  running  them  blindly  upward,  brushing </p>
<p>past  the  hem  of  her  skirt  and  the  delicate  fabric  of  her 
underwear until he found her arse. </p>
<p>She  moaned  softly  and  her  hips  bucked  against  him. 
Moving her lips to his neck, she laid a trail of breathless kisses 
downward  until  she  reached  the  top  of  his  t-shirt.  With  her 
hands  around  his  waist,  she  lifted  it  up,  aﬀording  him  a 
momentary  view  of  her  incredible  cleavage  as  her  heaving 
breasts hung down in the gap between them, still constricted 
by the conﬁnes of her top. </p>
<p>Shimmying down a little until her tits were pressed against 
the  unmistakeable  bulge  in  his  jeans,  she  continued  to  kiss 
her  way  down  his  chest  until  she  reached  his  belt.  Almost 
frantically, her ﬁngers worked at the buckle and then at the zip 
of  his  jeans  until,  ﬁnally,  she  was  able  to  pull  them  oﬀ  him 
entirely  and  discard  them  onto  the  ﬂoor  beside  her  hoody. 
Running  her  hand  over  the  top  of  his  boxer  shorts,  her 
delicate ﬁngers caressed the bulge beneath the soft material, 
before reaching up and pulling them away too.</p>
<p>Free,  his  penis  stood  erect  above  his  muscular  abdomen, 
and even as his gaze was drawn in once again by the pair of 
enormous breasts before him, he couldn’t help but notice the 
slight look of surprise on his ex-girlfriend’s face. </p>
<p>He was bigger than she remembered. 
Her  tits  disappeared  from  view  as  she  lowered  her  head 
toward his waist, and he closed his eyes as her warm, wet lips 
closed  softly  around  his  aching  cock.  Already  shallow,  his 
breathing  grew  ragged  as  she  slowly  began  to  work  her  way 
up and down. His mind, on ﬁre, leapt back to the image of her 
in her shower, before fast-forwarding to the moment she had 
removed her hoody.</p>
<p>His  hips  bucked,  and  he  groaned  softly  as  he  came.  She 
had learnt some new tricks since they had split up, and that, 
couple  with  her  recent  growth  spurt,  meant  he  hadn’t  lasted 
long  at  all.  He  knew  that  she  had  been  expecting  it  though, 
and  he  had  felt  her  grasp  his  hips  ﬁrmly  as  she  swallowed 
over  and  over  again.  Ironically,  it  lasted  longer  than  normal, 
and  with  each  spasm  and  murmured  groan,  he  felt  her  grip 
tighten a little, and even as the throbbing began to dissipate, 
he pushed as hard as he could. </p>
<p>‘Oh, my god.’</p>
<p>She had more gasped it than spoken it.</p>
<p>He opened his eyes to see her resting before him, her arms 
propping  herself  up  at  the  end  of  the  sofa  between  his  legs. 
Immediately,  he  found  himself  staring  at  the  taught  fabric  of 
her t-shirt. It was unmistakable: her breasts had grown again. 
Filling  the  space  around  them  to  the  maximum,  they  had 
expanded  in  the  only  direction  they  could.  Downward.  Her 
nipples  continued  to  poke  angrily  through  the  fabric,  and,  as 
he  glanced  down,  he  saw  a  series  of  other  small  yet  still 
noticeable changes. Though the bulge of her breasts created 
an enormous overhang, he could now see the faint outline of 
her small, round belly pressing against the front of her t-shirt, 
and from where her engorged breasts were now causing it to 
ride  up  slightly  higher,  he  see  that  her  muﬃn  top  was  now 
spilling over the top of her skirt. Though he couldn’t be sure, 
he suspected that even her hips were a little wider.</p>
<p>‘I can’t believe how good that tast…’</p>
<p>She  trailed  oﬀ  as  she  opened  her  eyes,  her  gaze  darting </p>
<p>momentarily to his face before returning to his crotch. </p>
<p>She wasn’t the only one who had grown. </p>
<p>Whereas  he  was  normally  a  fairly  healthy  eight  or  so 
inches,  he  was  now  a  solid  nine  or  even  ten  –  and  still  rock 
hard. </p>
<p>‘But…’</p>
<p>Apparently  oblivious  to  the  changes  within  her  own  body, 
she glanced at him in breathless confusion. Reaching out, she 
wrapped an inquisitive hand ﬁrmly around his new girth.</p>
<p>‘When you do what you just did,’ he murmured with a slight 
shrug  and  a  shudder  as  she  began  to  move  her  hand  slowly 
back and forth, ‘I’ll get bigger and stay hard until we –,’</p>
<p>He gasped as she squeezed him playfully.</p>
<p>‘– until we do something else.’</p>
<p>Her  gaze  ﬁxed  largely  on  his  quivering  penis,  he  saw  her </p>
<p>cock an intrigued eyebrow.</p>
<p>‘Interesting,’  she  murmured,  lifting  herself  slowly  up,  her 
breasts  catching  on  the  end  of  the  sofa  as  she  moved 
upward. His eyes closed again as he felt her take him into her 
mouth,  and  though  he  suspected  that  she  was  struggling  a 
little  with  his  size,  it  was  clear  that  she  wasn’t  going  to  let  it 
get in her way.</p>
<p>Twisting and turning, she managed to tease him for several 
minutes, her hands pressing down ﬁrmly on his waist to stop 
him moving too much as she sucked. Before long, though, he 
felt himself begin to lose control, and as he groaned loudly, he 
felt his entire body go rigid. His hips bucked as he came, and 
through  his  own,  powerful  orgasm,  he  heard  her  moan  softly 
as  she  swallowed.  Pressing  him  down  into  the  sofa,  the 
sensation  of  her  lips  pressed  tightly  around  him  only 
intensiﬁed  it,  and  for  what  felt  like  more  than  a  minute  he 
came continuously into her mouth, her groans muﬄed as she 
tried to keep up.</p>
<p>Finally, the throbbing subsided, and even though he felt his </p>
<p>cock stiﬀen, he opened his eyes.</p>
<p>She was kneeling at the end of the sofa, her eyes closed as 
she panted heavily. Her tits had grown to the point where he 
doubted  they  could  possibly  move  even  an  inch  beneath  the 
furiously  taught  t-shirt;  the  material  cutting  sharply  into  her 
back  as  her  breasts  pulled  at  the  front.  With  her  top  now 
pulled  even  higher,  he  could  see  the  round  curve  of  her 
swollen belly poking out the bottom, the waistline of her skirt 
taught around her ﬂeshy waist.</p>
<p>‘That was amazing,’ she moaned, her open palms propping </p>
<p>herself up against the end of the sofa, ‘but I can’t breathe.’</p>
<p>She  gasped  a  dark  laugh,  and  he  watched,  almost 
hypnotised,  as  she  reached  up  and  grabbed  at  one  of  her 
enormous  boobs,  her  ﬁngernails  digging  in  to  the  stretched 
fabric  of  her  t-shirt.  She  moaned  loudly  and  swayed  as  she 
squeezed  the  mass  of  ﬂesh  beneath  her  hand,  her  face 
ﬂushed  as  she  eyes  never  broke  contact  with  his.  Then, 
reaching down, she pulled at the hem of the distorted garment 
and, with a little diﬃculty, pulled it up and over her head.</p>
<p>He took it all in as it was revealed: her ﬂared hips and the 
outpouring of ﬂesh around her waist pushed up and out into a 
muﬃn top by her waistband; the bulge of her belly as though 
she  had  spent  the  last  few  hours  stuﬃng  her  face;  her 
remarkably narrow waist and then…</p>
<p>Her fantastic breasts came free from the conﬁnes of the t-
shirt,  and  with  a  magniﬁcent  array  of  jiggling  and  bouncing </p>
<p>spread  out  to  take  their  proper  shape  and  size.  They  must 
have been at least J-cups, he thought to himself. Though still 
teardrop shaped, they had lost some of their perkiness, giving 
them  a  shape  that  looked  entirely  natural.  Which  was,  he 
knew, a side eﬀect of growing the way they had. When he got 
his hands on them he’d be able to change that.</p>
<p>Above him, he saw her expression change as her attention 
moved  away  from  herself  and  back  to  him  –  and  he  glanced 
down:  he  was  still  rock  hard,  and  well  past  10  inches.  Her 
ﬂushed face spread into a grin as she reached out and began 
to stroke his throbbing dick. Though her lower half was hidden 
from view as she kneeled at the end of the sofa, all he wanted 
was to rip her panties oﬀ and…</p>
<p>She leaned forward, her tits ﬂowing and bulging against the 
insides of his legs as she approached him from the third time.</p>
<p>‘Wait,’ he begun, ‘we can –,’</p>
<p>In front of him, her warm breath making his cock twitch, he </p>
<p>saw her shake her head.</p>
<p>‘Oh no,’ she said darkly. ‘We’re doing this my way.’</p>
<p>Her  grip  tightened  around  him  and  he  couldn’t  help  but </p>
<p>‘And when we do ‘do it’, I want you to be the biggest I can </p>
<p>moan.</p>
<p>take.’</p>
<p>She shot him a look that told him everything he needed to 
know, and as she pushed his hips forcefully into the sofa, she 
wrapped her lips around him once again.</p>
<p>Though  he  couldn’t  quite  tell  how  much  of  him  she  was 
able  to  take  into  her  mouth,  it  didn’t  matter.  Each  movement 
was  ecstasy,  and  he  found  himself  holding  his  breath  as  she 
rotated a little to the left and then right, moving up and down, 
her  enormous  tits  ﬁlling  the  gap  between  his  legs  and 
pressing against his balls.</p>
<p>Soon,  he  felt  his  orgasm  beginning  to  build,  and  as  he 
pictured her mischievous expression and expanding body, he 
found himself determined to give her exactly what she wanted 
–  and  perhaps  a  little  bit  more.  Summoning  everything  he 
could,  he  forced  as  much  as  he  could  into  making  his 
pulsating cock as big as possible, and as he began to come, 
he  pushed  as  much  cum  out  as  possible,  the  desperately 
needy moans coming from his midsection keeping him going </p>
<p>and  going.  How  she  kept  her  lips  wrapped  so  tightly  around 
him,  he  simply  couldn’t  fathom,  and  as  the  throbbing  ﬁnally 
began  to  subside,  he  found  himself  wondering  what  she 
would look like when he opened his eyes. Down below, he felt 
his cock twitch, and, for the ﬁrst time, he realised that though 
she had slowed, she hadn’t stopped her rhythmic movement. 
This  time,  and  though  mainly  by  the  sensation  of  her  mouth 
growing  smaller  around  him,  he  felt  himself  grow;  his  penis 
lengthening  as  it  grew  thicker  and  heavier.  Undeterred,  she 
was building speed, and as he found himself simply unable to 
do anything but lie on his back on the sofa, he found himself 
moaning almost uncontrollably.</p>
<p>She was mad! 
Unable to see it, this time he felt the growth of her breasts; 
the soft yet taught skin expanding outward against his legs as 
she  sucked  feverishly.  She  too  was  moaning,  he  was  sure, 
and as he felt her try to take him as deeply as she could, he 
felt  himself  start  to  come.  Without  warning,  and  so  violently 
that  he  almost  dislodged  her  hands  from  his  hips,  he 
exploded  into  her  mouth,  his  hips  bucking  and  his  moans 
drowning  out  her  whimpers  as  she  frantically  swallowed 
everything  he  gave  her.  By  the  time  he  stopped,  he  had  lost 
track  of  time;  his  head  was  spinning  and  his  whole  body  felt 
light. Had it not been for his desire to see what he had done to 
her body, he could easily have passed out.</p>
<p>Gasping  for  air,  sweat  glistening  oﬀ  her  body,  he  watched 
as  she  staggered  to  her  feet  at  the  end  of  the  sofa.  Her  tits 
were  fantastic;  swaying  and  wobbling  as  she  tried  to  stand. 
Not  only  had  they  grown  out  sideways,  they  had  bulged 
outward  as  well  as  down  as  gravity  took  its  toll  on  their 
incredible  size.  They  must  have  been  slightly  bigger  than 
basketballs, creating their own cleavage down from her neck 
to  her  stomach.  And  speaking  of  which.  Though,  somehow, 
her  waist was still,  relatively  speaking,  narrow, the waistband 
of her skirt was digging into her ﬂared hips to such an extent 
he  was  surprised  it  wasn’t  hurting  her.  And,  to  be  accurate, 
the small skirt was now almost just a waistband. Whilst, above 
it, her almost-pregnant looking belly extended out toward him 
– the lower half of her enormous breasts resting against it, the 
lower  half  had  been  pushed  upward  by  the  expansion  that </p>
<p>had  taken  place  there.  It  was  the  ﬁrst  time  he  had  seen  her 
lower  half  since  she  had  ﬁrst  dropped  to  her  knees,  and  he 
couldn’t  believe  the  changes  that  had  occurred  there.  Trying 
desperately to wiggle her ﬁngers through the band in order to 
remove  it,  he  watched  as  she  turned  slowly  on  the  spot,  her 
entire body jiggling as he took it in.</p>
<p>Her  slender  legs  had  doubled  in  size,  her  thigh  gap 
disappearing  to  be  replaced  by  her  two,  enormous, 
curvaceous  thighs  which  had,  in  expanding  outward,  pushed 
her  skirt  upward  and  over  her  bum  –  which  had  been  doing 
some  growing  of  it’s  own.  Perhaps  due  to  her  previous 
dedication  to  the  gym,  her  arse  had  somehow  retained  it’s 
incredible  shape  as  it  had  swollen  and  doubled  in  size,  her 
two  large  cheeks  taught  and  perfectly  shaped  as  they 
stretched  her  lacy  lingerie  to  it’s  limit.  Until,  ﬁnally,  she 
wrestled  the  last  of  her  clothing  away  –  her  enormous  tits 
blocking her elegant sweep of an arm as she tried to discard 
them onto the ﬂoor.</p>
<p>Finally  naked,  she  turned  to  face  him,  her  incredible 
hourglass  ﬁgure  swaying  before  him  as  his  cock  began  to 
throb  again.  As  though  drawn  to  it,  she  took  a  step  forward, 
her  eyes  taking  in  it’s  size  with  a  strange  expression  of 
eagerness  and  determination.  It  was  enormous,  and  as  he 
looked between it and her, he found himself consumed by the 
singular desire to push himself deep within her.</p>
<p>She  knelt  astride  him  as  she  had  done  before,  shimmying 
her  incredible  body  forward  until  his  enormous  dick  was 
resting  against  her  swollen  belly.  Then,  lifting  herself  slightly, 
she took it in her hand and positioned herself above it. With a 
look  of  gleeful  desire,  she  closed  her  eyes  and  slowly  began 
to lower herself.</p>
<p>He listened to her deep, drawn out moan as she began to 
take him inside her; her tight, wet, warmth surrounding him as 
his dick throbbed within her. Bit by by, she continued lowering 
herself  down,  and  he  saw  her  bite  her  bottom  lip  as  she 
gasped.  Slowly,  her  enormous  breasts  grew  closer  to  him, 
their magniﬁcent size and shape almost within his reach.</p>
<p>Oh, what he still had to do to them! To her! </p>
<p>And  then,  incredibly,  she  came  to  rest  against  him,  the 
entirety  of  him  taken  within  her,  her  incredible  body  angled 
slightly forward as she placed a hand beside his shoulder. Her 
soft, ﬂeshy belly pressed against his stomach, and her breasts 
hovered tantalising close to his face.</p>
<p>You have time, he told himself.</p>
<p>With  incredible  self  control,  he  placed  his  hands  on  her 
arse,  his  ﬁngers  sinking  into  her  soft  ﬂesh  as  he  heard  her 
moan in response; her body sinking into his as she quivered.</p>
<p>Slowly, yet forcefully, he used his hands to pull her forward </p>
<p>slightly, his enormous dick moving inside her.</p>
<p>She  gasped  loudly,  the  sound  transforming  into  another 
moan  as  she  pushed  back  against  him,  then  forward  again. 
With  a  soft,  almost  guttural  sound  escaping  her  lips  each 
time, she began to establish a slow and steady rhythm.</p>
<p>And with her distracted, he gently squeezed her arse, and 
concentrated. The sensation was the same as it had been two 
days  before,  though  now,  skin  to  skin,  it  was  stronger  and 
more intense. It was almost like an energy, and as she slowly 
gyrated  on  top  of  him,  he  felt  it  ﬂow  into  her  through  his 
ﬁngers. Though he couldn’t see it’s eﬀect, he could feel it, and 
as he channelled it as he wanted, he felt her begin to grow.</p>
<p>Her  hips  grew  wider,  her  thighs  rounder  as  he  channelled 
the muscle and fat into just the right areas to keep her ﬁgure 
nothing  but  stunning.  Though  by  no  means  ﬁnished,  he 
moved his hands up to her waist, keeping her hourglass ﬁgure 
intact as he rounded the top of the thighs. Gently, he ran his 
ﬁngers up her stomach, adding ﬂesh to make her soft, ﬂabby 
belly round and taught. </p>
<p>And then came something he did not expect.</p>
<p>‘My boobs,’ she gasped above him, her eyes closed as she </p>
<p>moved back and forth above him. ‘Please. Make them –,’</p>
<p>She whimpered as he forced himself to grow a little inside </p>
<p>her.</p>
<p>‘Make them bigger.’ 
He didn’t need to be told twice.</p>
<p>Removing his hands from her swollen stomach, he paused 
for a fraction of second, before taking her fantastic tits in his 
hands.  Above  him  she  let  out  a  helpless  cry  as  he  squeezed 
them  gently,  and  then,  with  an  incredible  amount  of  ﬂesh </p>
<p>pressing  through  his  ﬁngers,  he  lifted  them  up  as  though 
imitating  a  push-up  bra.  Even  as  he  did,  he  squeezed,  the 
energy ﬂowing through his ﬁngers into her tits. And incredibly, 
bulging upward in his hands, he felt them begin to change in 
order to stay that way. The eﬀect of gravity on their enormous 
size  reduced,  and  as  they  slowly  began  to  expand  between 
his  ﬁngers,  he  saw  them  take  on  a  new,  perfect  teardrop 
shape  as  they  hung  oﬀ  her  chest.  As  though,  now,  entirely 
unaﬀected by their incredible mass, they simply continued to 
grow as he channelled more and more energy into her.</p>
<p>Though this time, she was very much aware of it.</p>
<p>‘Yes!’  she  whispered  breathlessly,  whimpering  as  she </p>
<p>pushed herself backward and forward on top of him. </p>
<p>Unsteadily,  she  raised  a  hand  from  the  sofa,  and  as  he 
removed  his  own  hands,  she  grabbed  her  left  boob.  As  her 
ﬁngers settled into the soft ﬂesh, her small hand ridiculous in 
comparison, she cried out.</p>
<p>‘Oh my god,’ she breathed. ‘I’m going to come.’</p>
<p>She  shuddered,  her  hand  returning  to  the  sofa,  and  he 
found  her  enormous  tits  surging  toward  him  as  she  leaned 
forward, her head hovering above his chest.</p>
<p>‘Wait,’ he replied with a little urgency. ‘You need to wait for </p>
<p>me.’</p>
<p>kicked.</p>
<p>‘I…can’t…’</p>
<p>She  groaned,  her  mouth  remaining  open  as  her  hips </p>
<p>Fighting to bring himself to orgasm, he felt himself pulsate 
within  her  –  which  was  the  ﬁnal  straw  for  her.  He  felt  her 
spasm around him, and even as he felt himself rushing toward 
orgasm, he felt her go rigid. Inside her, he continued to twitch, 
the  motion  enough  to  make  her  whimper  slightly  each  time. 
As  her  own  orgasm  began  to  hit  her,  he  began  to  feel  it. 
Though  his  hands  rested  on  her  enormous  butt,  without  any 
intent  or  input  from  him,  he  felt  it  beginning  to  grow  once 
more.  As  she  shuddered  and  moaned  on  top  of  him,  her 
inﬂated body sinking into his, he felt everything else begin to 
grow  too.  Around  his  waist,  her  thighs  began  to  expand, 
whilst against his stomach, he felt her belly begin to balloon. 
All of which couldn’t come close to her breasts.</p>
<p>All of which, ﬁnally, pushed him over the edge.</p>
<p>Inside her, he felt himself erupt, his cum ﬂowing into her as 
he grunted helplessly – entirely unable to explain that this was 
why he should have come ﬁrst.</p>
<p>As  the  ﬁrst  of  his  spasms  hit  her,  he  felt  her  shudder,  a<br />
breath  escaping  her  lips  as  her  head  collapsed  onto  his 
shoulder.  With  each  enormous  release,  he  heard  her  gasp 
almost  silently  in  his  ear,  entirely  unable  to  move  as  another 
orgasm hit her.</p>
<p>And  it  wasn’t  just  his  writhing  dick  that  was  making  her 
quiver  uncontrollably.  As  his  cum  ﬂooded  through  her,  and 
entirely unable to do anything to stop it, he simply placed his 
hands  around  her  as  she  ballooned.  Her  thighs  began  to 
squash him as they grew, his hands struggling to encompass 
the  size  of  her  arse  as  it  too  expanded.  Between  them  he 
could  feel  her  belly  growing  in  every  direction  as  if  she  was 
overdue  to  give  birth.  And  her  breasts.  Pressed  between 
them,  resting  against  his  upper  chest,  he  felt  them  grow  in 
every  direction  until  the  force  of  their  expansion  began  to  lift 
her upward in order to generate more space. With each of her 
muted  cries  as  her  second,  or  perhaps  even  third,  orgasm 
ravaged her, he felt her grow. With each of his uncontrollable 
grunts, he felt her balloon a little more.</p>
<p>Finally though, her last orgasm subsiding alongside his, he 
felt  the  throbbing  began  to  subside.  And  suddenly  he 
remembered the look on her face from earlier.</p>
<p>Even as the last throes of his orgasm shot through him, he 
concentrated  hard  and,  one  last  time,  pushed  his  penis  as 
hard as he could.</p>
<p>He felt the last eruption surge into her; her slowing rate of 
expansion reversing momentarily as, all at once, every part of 
burgeoned  under  a  fresh  wave  of  ﬂesh.  Unsuspecting,  and 
ﬁnally  beginning  to  regain  her  breath  as  she  lay,  exhausted, 
against  him,  he  felt  her  tense  as  another  wave  of  pleasure 
rocked her body.</p>
<p>‘Ooh,’  he  heard  her  whimper,  before  suddenly,  to  his </p>
<p>immense surprise, he felt her pass out.</p>
<p>Standing in darkness at the window on the opposite side of 
the small marina bay, the woman stood motionless, her breath 
caught  in  her  throat.  Why  she  had  originally  come  from  her </p>
<p>kitchen  to  her  living  room  was  now  a  mystery;  she  had 
popped in to get something and, by chance, caught sight of a 
mystery  woman  standing  in  the  apartment  across  the  way  of 
the man she quite fancied. For how long she had stood there, 
utterly motionless, in the darkness, she did not know; her eyes 
wide as she had followed the events that had unfolded in the 
dimly-lit  apartment  just  close  enough  for  her  to  see  into 
across  the  way.  In  her  chest,  her  heart  pounded,  and  as  she 
took  in  the  sight  before  her,  realising  that  now  might  be  the 
time  to  ﬁnally  turn  away,  she  absentmindedly  raised  a  hand 
and somewhat wistfully cupped one of her small breasts.</p>
