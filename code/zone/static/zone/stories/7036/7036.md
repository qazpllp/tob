Thanks for reading! 

This wasn’t my first time in  Las Vegas, but it was my first time alone in Vegas. In the 

past, I had always gone with friends or family for a wedding, or a birthday, or a bachelor party; 

this time I was there for more professional reasons. I would be finishing grad school in a couple 

months,  and  this  weekend  there  was  going  to  be  a  conference  with  a  lot of  recruiters,  and  our 

school had strongly suggested that going would be good for our future careers. 

I  decided  to  arrive  a  day  early  so  that  I  could  enjoy  the  city,  but  I  was  a  little  nervous 

about  being  here  on  my  own.  My  flight  had  landed;  I  had  checked  into  my  room,  and  I  was 

wandering around the second floor of the Luxor when I bumped into Celina. 

Celina and I were in the same class; we weren’t  friends, but we knew each other fairly 

well,  having  taken  numerous  courses  together  and  even  been  part  of  the  same  study  group  or 

partnered  up  for  a  lab  project  on  occasion.  She  was  also  cute.  She  wasn’t  gorgeous  by  most 

standards, but she was exactly my type. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

She  was  in  her early thirties with  pale and lightly  freckled skin,  dark eyes, and straight 

black hair. Her features were pretty and somewhat unique; she was obviously biracial, but it was 

impossible to tell from her looks whether she was part Asian, Hispanic, Native American, Pacific 

Islander, or perhaps all of them at once. 

She was short, needing to stand on her toes to reach five feet, and with a curvy figure. I 

wouldn’t quite call her chubby, but she was close to it. She had large, pill shaped breasts, which I 

estimated were probably a healthy D cup; although they seemed even bigger on her short frame. 

She had a slight potbelly, which stuck out nearly as far as her breasts, with broad hips, chubby 

thighs, and a cute bubble butt which she was embarrassed about but which I knew the other girls 

envied. 

casual ponytail. 

She  never  dressed  to  show  off  her  figure,  and  even  in  Vegas  that  trend  continued.  She 

was currently wearing modest boots, faux leather pants, and a dark blue t-shirt with the logo of 

some  band  I  didn’t  recognize  stretched  tight  across  her  bosom.  No  jewelry,  and  if  she  was 

wearing any makeup it was subtle enough that I couldn’t tell. Her dark hair was pulled back in a 

Now, I know what you are thinking. No, she wasn’t my ex or my secret crush or anything 

like that. We were both single, and she was nice enough, didn’t seem crazy and was more than 

smart  enough  to  have  a  conversation  with,  but  I  had  never  shown  any  romantic  inclination 

towards her. Mostly it was that I was still broken up over my last relationship, but also because I 

was just plain shy around women and didn’t want to make our classes weird.  

So I had never asked her out. In hindsight I probably should have. It certainly would have 

made the small talk on the casino floor less awkward. 

Celina was, obviously, there for the same reason I was. Still, it was extremely lucky that 

we had run into one another. At least, that is what I thought at the time; now I am not so sure. 

She had never been in a real casino before, and was looking to forward to giving it a try, but was 

also anxious. I told her that I was an expert at Blackjack, a bit of an exaggeration, and offered to 

teach her how to play. She looked pensive for a moment, but then agreed.  

I offered to buy her a drink, but was then informed that they were free. Oops. 

 

We then went looking for a table. I made sure to let Celina lead the way, mostly so that I 

could see what those leather pants were doing for her behind. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It wasn’t easy. The casino was packed, and it seemed that the only blackjack tables which 

had open seats were those with a twenty dollar minimum bet or more. We weren’t wealthy, few 

grad-students  are, and  I  was  hoping to  find a five or ten dollar table so that we could  actually 

play  for  a  bit  before  running  out  of  money.  But  it  wasn’t  happening;  I  was  starting  to  get 

frustrated and afraid that Celina was just going to tell me to forget the whole idea. 

 Then,  I  looked  through  a  glass  pane  into  a  side  room;  dimly  lit  and  with  a  large  card 

table in the center. It looked like a high rollers room, or maybe a baccarat table, but it had the 

standard six deck auto-shuffler set up and the outlines of  cards printed upon the felt.  I stepped 

inside, and Celina followed. 

The dealer was a middle aged woman with lots of curly red hair spilling down her back. 

Her  uniform  didn’t  match  any  of  the  others,  it  was  a  frilly  dress  that  almost  seemed  like 

something out of the old west, but I didn’t really think anything of it at the time. I asked her what 

the table minimum was, and she told me that there was none. 

Celina and I sat down next to one another, neither really knowing what to say. The dealer 

pulled out a single deck of cards and began to shuffle by hand, and I realized what was going on. 

This was one of those “old timey” side games made to take advantage of people who think they 

can count cards, where they only use one deck but also don’t pay out extra on blackjack and let 

the dealer hit on a soft seventeen. 

We pulled out our wallets, and I considered covering for Celina, but I thought that might 

be coming on too strong.  The dealer looked at them and said: 

“First hand is free, as long as you agree to keep what you win. That ok?” 

Celina looked at me apprehensively, and honestly I was just as baffled as she was, but I 

didn’t  let  it  show,  and  I  decided  to  simply  push  on  ahead,  heedless  of  the  consequences.  I 

nodded, and told Celina to just say yes, which she trustingly did. 

Having agreed, the dealer asked which of us wanted to play first. I pointed to Celina and 

said “Ladies first,” in a voice that I hoped was smooth rather than creepy. 

“But, I don’t know what to do…” She asked. 

“Don’t worry, it’s simple, and I’ll help.” 

  

The dealer pulled the top card from the deck. It was larger than most playing cards, and 

well worn, with an unfamiliar design on its back. 

The  front  was  like  no  card  I  had  ever  seen;  it  vaguely  resembled  a  tarot  card,  but  not 

quite. The design was like an eighteenth century woodcut, depicting an image of a woman sitting 

in  a dark room, her back to  a seaside window, looking anxiously at  a man sleeping in  the bed 

before her and the long knife which lay on the nightstand. The Blade, it read. 

  

I had no idea what this meant. This obviously wasn’t Blackjack, and I didn’t know what 

it was. I was steeling myself to admit as much, to apologize to the dealer and call the whole thing 

off, when I was distracted by a curious clicking sound coming from the table to my left. 

I saw Celina eagerly tapping at the leather band around the table with bright red nails that 

must have been several inches long. They were obviously fake, and I was amazed that I hadn’t 

noticed them yet, but I just chalked it up to nerves and my usual oblivious nature. 

“Woah,” I said. 

“What?” Celina asked, impatiently. 

“Nothing, I just noticed your nails.” 

“Yeah.” 

“Oh, you like them?” She asked as she held them up to the light for me to see. 

“Thanks. They took me years to grow, but I think it was worth it.” 

I  nodded.  I  was  pretty  sure  she  was  teasing  me,  but  I  played  along.  There’s  no  way  I 

wouldn’t  have  noticed  those  talons  at  some  point  in  the  last  three  years,  and  they  would  have 

made  lab-work  awfully  difficult  for  her.  Hell,  just  putting  on  a  rubber  glove  would  be  all  but 

impossible. 

As I was pondering this, the dealer had grown impatient and handed Celina the next card. 

This one depicted a Viking shield maiden, perhaps a Valkyrie, wearing stereotypical opera garb 

and offering a large stein of foaming ale to the viewer. It was titled The Horns of Heidrun. 

I still no idea what it meant or how the game was going. The dealer seemed not to notice, 

and again I was distracted, this time by Celina trying to subtly adjust her clothes. I looked down 

and saw a pair of prominent nipples pressing into the fabric of her shirt; so erect that they seemed 

almost the size of campfire marshmallows. I realized that this must be the first time I had seen 

her without a bra, and  gave a silent  thank  you to  whoever had decided to spend the electricity 

required to keep the casino at sixty-five degrees despite it being April in Nevada. 

The  dealer  waited  for  Celina  to  meet  her  eyes,  and  then  dealt  the  next  card.  It  was 

labelled The Sailors and showed a man on the deck of an old fashioned clipper ship, staring in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

horror at something just out of sight in the waves below. Celina squirmed slightly in her seat, but 

didn’t say anything. 

 

The next  card showed a group of birds with  the heads and breasts of beautiful women, 

perched atop a cliff face and staring down with hungry eyes as an ancient trireme hurtled towards 

the jagged rocks below. The Siren. 

noncommittally. 

“This  game  is  weird,”  Celina  said,  in  a  high  pitched  voice.  “Yeah,  it  is,”  I  said 

“Am I ahead?” She asked, continuing her falsetto. 

“Looks like,” I responded. 

“So, what do I do?” She continued in her forced baby-doll voice.  

“Just, tell the dealer when you don’t want any more cards.” 

“That’s easy!” Celina squeaked. 

“Told you.” 

“But,  you’ll  tell  me  when,  right?”  She  asked,  her  voice  never  lowering  to  its  normal 

register.  I don’t know why she was trying to  sound like bimbo, but  I hoped it was her way of 

flirting, and I rather liked it. 

I  looked  her  in  the  eyes  and  nodded,  stealing  another  peek  at  her  straining  nipples  as  I 

did. 

 

 

 

elongated nails. 

labelled Ambrosia. 

“More?” the dealer asked. Celina squeaked an affirmative and tapped the table with her 

The  dealer  flipped  her  card,  which  showed  a  golden  chalice  full  of  blood  red  wine 

Nothing happened for a moment, but then I noticed two dark circles beginning to form on 

the front of Celina’s shirt. They continued to spread; the dark stains moving downward over the 

curve of her stomach, until it was impossible not to see what was happening. I tried not to stare, 

but I just couldn’t help myself. She of course noticed me looking, and immediately followed my 

gaze to the milk leaking down the front of her shirt.  

“Oh my god, I’m so sorry,” she said, her voice so high pitched it bordered on painful. She 

pulled the sodden fabric away from her chest, and then did her best to squeeze the moisture from 

it, smoothed it out, and then gasped  at the sensation when it once again stuck to her rock-hard 

nipples. 

Her cheeks turned bright red, and she continued in a slightly more normal tone “Sorry. I 

normally pump my breasts before I leave the house, but today with the trip and all I just forgot. 

I’m so embarrassed.” 

“It’s  ok,”  I  stuttered,  pretty  embarrassed  myself,  “I  didn’t  even  know  you  were 

expecting,” I said, trying to hide the note of disappointment in my voice. 

“Oh, I’m not,” Celina chirped, “the doctors gave me some pills after I hurt my back a few 

years ago, and one of the side effects was lactation.” 

That was weird, but I remembered hearing about similar things in my physiology class. 

Rare,  but  not  unheard  of,  and  I  remembered  Celina  having  to  leave  class  in  the  past  for 

chiropractic  appointments;  so  it  all  made  sense.  Not  a  lot  of  sense,  and  even  then  I  knew 

something weird was going on, but I was nervous and trying to act confident, and so I was in full 

rationalization mode. There was no rationalizing what happened next. 

The dealer ignored Celina, quietly and professionally, wiped a few drops of milk from the 

table  and  moved  the  cards  away  protectively,  then,  once  she  had  our  attention,  waved  away 

Celina’s  apology  and  added  another  card  to  the  pile.  It  showed  ancient  ruins,  with  a  bottom-

heavy Greek vase sitting on a pedestal, a number of long white feathers resting about its base. 

The Amphora. 

What  happened  next  was  impossible  to  miss;  indeed  I  will  remember  it  vividly  for  the 

rest of my life. Celina adjusted her clothes again, and then rose to her feet, bouncing slightly as 

she pulled her pants up. There was a sharp crack; which a second later I realized came from her 

pelvis, and I watched her hips surge outward between one blink and the next, each seeming to be 

suddenly wider by the width of her palm. 

As I tried to understand what I was seeing, Celina’s butt began to expand before my eyes. 

Slowly  but  surely,  her  cheeks  grew  both  larger  and  rounder,  like  underinflated  volleyballs 

hooked up to a bicycle pump. Celina didn’t really seem to notice, aside from plucking at what 

must have been a serious wedgie.  

Her  rear  grew  larger  and  shapelier,  her  already  prodigious  booty  soon  surpassing 

anything you would see in the mainstream media and reaching the size you would typically only 

find on augmented Instagram models, but from the way it jiggled as she bounced I could tell that 

it was all natural. Or, at least, all flesh, nothing about this was natural. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Finally  the  growth  stopped,  leaving  the  diminutive  brunette  looking  like  someone  had 

stuffed  a  pair  of  squat  pumpkins  down  the  back  of  her  pants  when  she  wasn’t  looking.  She 

seemed to finally get comfortable; her pants must have somehow changed to accommodate her 

new curves, and sat back down. Awkwardly at first, as if she wasn’t used to  the sensation, but 

she soon seemed to get comfortable, although she appeared to be resting several inches higher in 

the chair than before. 

going on here. 

Celina might be comfortable, but I wasn’t. As soon as the shock, and arousal, faded from 

the front of my mind, I started to stand, and barked at the dealer, demanding to know what was 

“Calm down,” she commanded, and I acquiesced. I settled in my chair, and asked what 

was happening; feeling suddenly very protective of the woman sitting next to me. 

“Don’t you like what is happening?” She asked. 

I stuttered. 

“Do you want to stop?” 

“Are you ok?” 

I didn’t, I really didn’t. But I knew it wasn’t right. So I turned to Celina. 

“Yeah. Do I have enough cards?” She asked in her high voice 

“Are you feeling ok about what’s happening?” 

“The game? Its fine,” she responded giggling slightly as if going along with a joke she 

didn’t understand. 

“To keep going,” I clarified. 

“Yes,” she said, starting to get a little irritated. It was dawning on me that she was totally 

oblivious to what was happening to her, but I wanted to see what came next. 

“Continue,” I told the dealer as I shook my head in resignation. 

The next card was called The Matron and it showed a voluptuous woman surrounded by 

young  children,  many  of  whom  sat  cradled  on  her  lap  or  rested  their  head  on  her  prodigious 

chest. 

The reaction was immediate and familiar. Celina’s breasts swelled, slowly and subtlety, 

in time with her breathing so that they rose with her chest as she inhaled but declined to fall with 

it as she exhaled. They kept their shape, growing both longer and broader as she filled  out. As 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

her bosom slid down her torso, her shirt was pulled up, exposing the swell of her belly and the 

indentation of her navel.  

escaped her lips nonetheless. 

She bit her lip and moaned at the sensation of the moist cotton being dragged against her 

sensitive nipples; she was obviously trying to keep quiet, but a high pitched whine of pleasure 

When the growth had finished, her tits had more than doubled in size. Each resembled a 

football, resting upon her belly and proudly extending a good four inches beyond it. 

Her nipples had grown slightly, but not quite so much as the rest of her breasts, leaving 

her monstrous teats looking almost proportional to the well stacked chest upon which they rode. 

Both the dealer and I stared at her, smiling softly at her obvious pleasure. Celina’s eyes 

fluttered closed, and after a moment I gently nudged her shoulder and told her we were waiting. 

“Sorry,” she squeaked. “Hit me!” 

The next card showed a wizened philosopher, perhaps Socrates himself, teaching a group 

of bright young pupils in the town square; while a beautiful young girl ignored him, staring at her 

reflection  in  a  nearby  pond  and  daydreaming.  The  Empty  Book  was  written  upon  the  card, 

although no book was visible on its face. 

Again, nothing seemed to happen at first, although I started to suspect what it did as the 

game went on. In hindsight, it seems that this card turned Celina into an airhead. A stereotypical 

dumb blonde trapped in a brunette’s body. She wasn’t stupid, not exactly, but she didn’t act like 

a prospective PhD in biochemistry either. Mostly it was just a short attention span that made her 

forgetful and easily distracted, and a habit of saying the first thing that came to her mind without 

thinking it through. I found it adorable, if sometimes irritating, but I am getting ahead of myself. 

Anyway, the next card to be dealt was  Homogeny,  and it depicted a group of identical 

young  women,  all  fashionable  dressed,  with  long  blonde  hair,  slender  figures,  and  flawless 

features; like human Barbie dolls on a shelf. 

The changes which this brought about in Celina were  subtle, but the end result was  the 

most drastic  yet.  Her face slowly resulted itself, growing more slender  and taking on a perfect 

oval  shape.  Her  nose  shrank  slightly  and  the  tip  rounded,  her  eyes  took  on  an  exaggerated 

almond shape that further obscured her ethnic background. Her eyebrows grew thinner, while her 

lashes lengthened. Her complexion cleared, the small blemishes across her cheeks and forehead 

disappeared, as did the slight scarring left over from teenage acne. 

The  most  drastic  change  was  her  mouth;  her  already  feminine  lips  filled  out  until  they 

were  extremely  full  and  shapely,  the  top  and  bottom  lips  each  perfectly  proportioned  to 

complement the other. 

All in all, Celina’s face was now the ideal of perfect feminine beauty.   

“Nice!” I said out loud. 

“Did I do good?” Celina asked, smiling up at me as I nodded. 

She  took  another  card,  which  showed  a  veiled  woman  standing  in  the  cemetery  by 

moonlight, her face obscured by shadows. The Mourner. 

Suddenly,  Celina’s  expression  darkened  and  her  face  took  on  an  edgy  look  as  makeup 

was smeared across her features with an invisible brush. Heavy eyeliner, thick mascara, dark red 

lipstick, and a pallid foundation that left her with skin like living ivory. 

Her clothes slowly morphed; her blue t-shirt darkened to black and the logo of the band 

into  her  t-shirt  changed  into  that  of  a  different  group,  something  edgier  that  I  had  also  never 

heard of. Her neckline dropped lower and lower, and her sleeves shrank, turning her shirt  first 

into a tank top and then into some sort of lacy black  bodice which simultaneously cinched her 

waist  and  thrust  her  tits  up  and  outward,  presenting  a  long  inviting  line  of  pale  cleavage  that 

jiggled with every breath. 

Likewise,  Celina’s  pants  shrank,  inching  their  way  up  her  legs  and  showing  more  and 

more of her thick thighs with every second, until they finally they were little more than a leather 

thong; so tight you could clearly see the outline of her pubic mound when she parted her legs. I 

had little doubt that they left her ass almost completely exposed, and the view from behind when 

she stood up would be undoubtably breathtaking.  

It didn’t last long though; black fishnet stocking materialized on her bare legs, and soon 

they were joined by a short frilly skirt, which flared outwards and was wrapped in gauzy black 

lace. 

Finally,  her  sensible  shoes  changed  into  a  pair  of  heavy  leather  boots,  with  platform 

soles, six inch spiked heels, and shiny silver buckles running almost all the way up to her knees.  

Her new look was amazing, a style that I would come to learn was called “Gothic Lolita”, 

and I thought it was sexy as hell, but it didn’t really fit with the Celina I knew. It certainly would 

have made her stand out in the lab, like a real life Abby Sciuto. 

“Keep going!” I urged her. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Celina didn’t have a clue what was going on, but she picked up on the fact that she was 

doing good and smiled enthusiastically, hitting the table. 

The next card showed a man slaving away at an easel,  a naked woman standing before 

him with a look of abject boredom on her face. It was, not surprisingly, called The Artist. 

Nothing happened at first, then Celina gave a small startled gasp. 

“What’s the matter?” I asked” 

“I can be such a ditz sometimes,” she squealed in annoyance as she dug through her purse 

and pulled out an expensive looking phone in a glittery case, “ I can’t believe I forgot to check in 

with  my  followers!” She straightened her hair, pursed her lips, held  out  her phone, and took a 

half dozen selfies. Then she selected the best one, and uploaded it to her Instagram before typing 

an  accompanying  caption,  quite  a  feat  given  her  nails,  which  said  “In  Vegas!  More  later! 

Kisses!” 

She  then  proceeded  to  open  her  Twitter,  Facebook,  Onlyfans,  and  several  other  apps  I 

had never heard of before the dealer cleared her throat. Celina didn’t hear her, so I leaned over 

and asked her if she could do that later. We had a game to get back to. 

“Huh?” She sighed. Then she looked up from her phone, took in her surroundings, and 

remembered where she was. 

“Oh. Sorry. Next card?” 

It  was  a  picture  of  a  pale  woman  with  blazing  green  eyes,  who  looked  not  all  that 

different from Celina. “Envy;” the dealer intoned flatly, “the next card’s value is doubled.” 

Said  card  showed  a  lonely  tower  in  an  isolated  forest.  A  saddled  horse  grazed  at  the 

tower’s base, but nobody else was around. The Prisoner. 

Suddenly, Celina’s hair began to grow rapidly, bursting out of the plain ponytail that tried 

to  hold  it  back.  It  became  thick  and  lustrous,  her  silky  black  locks  sliding  down  across  her 

shoulders and over the back of her chair, descended past her waist, and didn’t stop until it was 

pooling  on  the  floor  behind  her;  I  imagined  that  it  was  now  as  long  as  she  was  tall.  It  was 

gorgeous. 

 

“Keep going?” She asked. 

“Of course!”  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corks. 

The  dealer  turned  over  another  card  and  laid  it  before  Celina.  It  depicted  a  sprawling 

marketplace, tables loaded down with vibrantly colored produce, although most of the fruit was 

strange and of a species unknown to me. The Market. 

Celina’s  breasts  began  to  expand  again,  although  not  nearly  so  dramatically  this  time. 

Instead,  they  rode  higher  on  her  chest,  sticking  out  further  and  expanding,  taking  on  a 

pronounced melon shape. When they were finished, each of the grad student’s breasts was nearly 

as large as hear head, and to me they looked quite a bit like those that had once belonged to the 

legendary Pandora Peaks. Her thick nipples stood out clearly, roughly the size and shape of wine 

Celina saw me looking at her lustfully, and asked if that was good. 

“Very good,” I responded, to which she smiled and let out an exaggerated “Yay!” as she 

playfully  drummed  upon  her  new  cleavage  with  the  palms  of  her  hands,  which  started  her 

bouncing again. 

The dealer took the motion as her cue to draw another card. This one showed a girl in a 

school  uniform  being  followed  by  a  group  as  strange  old  men,  lust  obvious  in  their  eyes.  The 

letters written upon it spelled out The Maiden. 

The effect on Celina was subtle, and it was hard to put my finger on any one change. As 

best  as  I  could  tell,  her  face  grew  more  delicate,  and  the  small  wrinkles  around  her  eyes  and 

mouth faded away. Her cheeks became slightly fuller, and the freckles upon them and across the 

bridge of her nose and forehead grew more prominent even as those on her shoulders and chest 

faded  somewhat.  Her  breasts  grew  visibly  firmer  and  higher,  while  all  across  her  body  skin 

tightened and flesh grew toned.  

When the process was finished, she looked dramatically younger, like she was a teenager 

again. And, like a teenager, she had better things to do. 

“Are we almost done? This game’s boring.” She said in an exaggerated singsong voice. 

“Almost.” 

surface. 

amount.” 

Celina sighed and checked her phone, as she absent mindedly tapped on the table’s felt 

 

The next card depicted a man walking through the desert, straining under the weight of a 

bulging  sack  of  coins.  “Greed,”  the  dealer  said.  “The  next  card  is  worth  ten  times  the  normal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That got her attention again, and Celina and I both watched intently as the next card was 

dealt. It was called Cupid’s Arrow, and the illustration was of a young man kneeling at the feet of 

an indifferent woman, suicidal desperation filling his eyes. 

Suddenly, Celina was clutching my arm, her long nails digging painfully into flesh. She 

looked  up  at  me,  her  eyes  large  and  shinning,  and  then  she  moved  closer,  pressing  her  body 

against mine. She placed my hand over her engorged nipples and sighed as I reflexively grasped 

it, then leaned close, resting her forehead against my shoulder while gently running her lips over 

my bicep and leaving a trail of shallow butterfly kisses in her wake. 

I  awkwardly  moved  my  right  hand  over  to  her  and  timidly  ran  my  fingers  thought  her 

luxurious mane of midnight hair. 

The dealer didn’t wait for Celina to look up, and instead dealt the final card unbidden. It 

depicted a scene out of the Iliad, with a golden apple being presented to the fairest of the Greek 

goddesses. It read only The Apple. 

The dealer looked me in the eyes and told me that it looks like I won. 

“I didn’t realize I was playing.” 

She shrugged indifferently, and gestured toward Celina. 

“Choose her prize.” 

A  whirlwind  of  ideas  blew  through  my  head.  I  could  turn  her  back  to  normal.  I  could 

make her the prettiest girl in the world. I could give her true love. I could give her perfect health. 

I could make her smart again, maybe even smarter than before. I could make her rich. All good 

ideas, but instead, I decided to go for bust. 

“I want Celina to have the biggest boobs in the world which, despite their size, never sag 

The  dealer  nodded,  and  a  moment  later  Celina’s  breasts  began  to  expand,  until  my  lap 

was completely filled with soft, quivering, slightly freckled flesh. She moaned in pleasure, and 

rubbed against me, and for a moment I thought Celina was going to mount me right there, when 

or hurt her back.” 

the dealer interrupted. 

“Games over.”  

Once again,  I felt compelled to  obey.  I helped Celina to  her feet,  not  an easy task with 

breasts  that  had  to  weigh  close  to  fifty  pounds  each,  and  she  tottered  toward  the  door;  still 

lacking the muscle memory to walk in such high heels, especially with her new center of gravity. 

She steadied herself by clinging tightly to me for balance. 

 

Celina and I walked back out onto the main casino floor, her cleavage preceding her by a 

good  two  feet.  Her  breasts  were  now  roughly  the  size  and  shape  of  large  picnic  watermelons, 

each capped with an areola like a poker chip and with thick nipples like ripe strawberries. 

Her top had again expanded to accommodate her new figure, but it was all but impossible 

to support such a chest; flesh spilled out on all sides, and the thin straps which ran from the hem 

up to her shoulders was held taut, resting several inches above her flesh like the chains used to 

raise a drawbridge. 

to make my move. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Each step set her boobs jiggling, and made my heart flutter. I decided now was the time 

“So, I was thinking, you want to get dinner and maybe catch a show? Then afterwards, I 

was thinking, if you brought your swimsuit, you could come up and we could try out the hot tub, 

supposedly they have saunas in every room here.” 

“I  have  a  better  idea,”  Celina  said  in  her  girlish  voice,  and  then  she  did  her  best  to 

whisper in my ear, although she was still a good six inches too short. “Why don’t we go up to 

your room now, and then you can fuck me in the ass.” 

I  was  stunned  by  the  forwardness  of  her  offer,  and  I  glanced  around  nervously,  as  if 

afraid to be too eager. I looked at the glass behind us, and saw only an empty room, the dealer 

and her strange deck were gone. Oddly enough, the only thing I could think about was whether 

or not I should have tipped her. 

distinct memories of Celina. 

Suddenly,  I was  hit with  an odd sensation;  I  realized  I had two very  different and very 

In one, she was a cute, if not quite gorgeous, girl whom I had gone to school with for the 

past three years and always found an excuse not to ask out on a date, until a chance meeting in 

Las Vegas led to the crazy adventure you just read. 

In the other one, I had never seen her before today. I had come to the Luxor alone, and as 

I wandered around looking for something to do, I had seen a crowd gathering around one of the 

side rooms. At the center was a young multiracial girl in goth attire, sexy as all hell and showing 

about a mile of cleavage. As far as I could tell, she was some sort of Instagram model doing a 

meet and greet, and as I conspicuously moved around the crowd trying to get a better look at her, 

our eyes locked and she waved me over. 

 

I nervously walked up, and she motioned for me to come around to her side of the table 

and sit next to her. I obliged. She immediately grasped my hand under the table, and told me that 

her name was Salina, with a S and a heart above the i. I was my usual self, nervous and tongue 

tied around strangers, but she did enough talking for both of us, her high-pitched voice cutting 

through the murmur of the crowd. As the afternoon went on, she moved closer and closer to me, 

and paid less and less attention to the adoring fans who came seeking her autograph or a picture 

with  her.  By  the  end,  she  was  actually  sitting  in  my  lap,  resting  her  head  on  my  shoulder  and 

staring daggers at any woman who so much looked in my direction. 

After  the  event,  she  clung  to  me,  refusing  to  let  me  out  of  her  reach,  and  walked 

alongside me. We got some odds looks, a guy in his thirties with a girl who appeared to be about 

half his age, but this was Vegas, where such things were not out of the ordinary. 

As  we  discussed  our  plans  for  the  evening,  my  memories  again  converged,  with  the 

previous reality seeming hazy, like a well remembered dream.  

Just then, Salina looked me in the eye and in a girlish voice said “I just had a crazy idea.” 

“Huh?” I asked. 

“Well, seeing as we are already in Las Vegas, why don’t we get married? That way we 

can be together forever, until we are both dead.” 

I was taken aback. Then, for the second time that day, I found myself in a situation where 

I  had  no  idea  what  I  was  about  to  get  into,  but  still  decided  to  push  on  heedless  of  the 

consequences.
