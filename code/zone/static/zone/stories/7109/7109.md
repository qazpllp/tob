The Valentine�s Special


By: Kodos


 


����������� �Why do we
have to celebrate Valentine's Day *tonight*?� I asked Penny, squinting
through the windshield and wishing the defroster would hurry up, �Can't we just
go out next weekend when everything isn't overpriced and overcrowded and maybe
it's more than twenty degrees outside?�


 


����������� �Don't
worry, love, I know you hate crowds,� Penny said with a smile, tugging at the
long ponytail that kept her dark hair from getting too unruly, �That's why I
made our reservations well ahead of time.�
I promise; it'll be fun; they're not even filling up every table; the
owner said she likes to keep things cozy and intimate for evenings like
this.� Trust me; you're going to have an incredibletime.�


 


����������� �Okay, if
you say so,� I conceded as we passed over the river, the truck finally beginning
to warm up, �So were exactly *are* we going?� You still haven't told me where to find this
place.�


 


����������� �Here, take
a right onto Cary,� Penny said, pointing to an approaching exit ramp, �Well, I
hate to spoil the surprise, so let's just say it's a place we've never been
before but I'm suspect you're very familiar with.�


 


����������� �Well, okay
then,� I said as we merged onto the crowded city street, where it seemed like
every last cafe and restaurant was absolutely packed for the night with happy
couples and the lovelorn looking to drown their sorrows in good company, �Just
tell me when we're getting close, okay?�


 


����������� �Thanks,
hon; I know you're going to love it once we get there,� Penny said as she gave
my arm a squeeze, �It's just that we're only going to have one first
Valentine's together since we got married, and I want it to be special; I
promise, it's going to be a night to remember.�


 


����������� Unsure what
to make of my wife's enigmatic words, I drove on in silence; inching forwards
in a glacial stream of cars searching for a free space to park, stopping at
every crosswalk as couples passed in front of us, most bundled up tight against
the February cold, though a few women here and there dressed as if they dared
the cold keep them from showing as much skin as they wished.� At last Penny pointed to a vacant spot.


 


����������� �There, pull
in right there!� she urged before I missed my opening.


 


����������� �I don't
think that's a legal spot,� I protested, �There's cones and stuff; they must be
unloading something there.�


 


����������� �That's
where they're unloading *us*!� Come
on, you're going to miss it!� Penny insisted, almost grabbing the wheel to get
us over, �This is the place; trust me.�


 


����������� �Really, The
Muffin Top?� I asked, pulling doubtfully into the reserved spot, �I thought
this place was a bakery or a candy store or something.�


 


����������� �Oh, so
you've heard of it, then?� Penny asked, smiling conspiratorially.


 


����������� �What?� I
asked, caught off guard as I pulled the brake and cut the lights, �Penny, I
drive this way to work every day, and their front window is always full of
cakes and stuff; I don't think it's a huge secret what goes on in there.�


 


����������� �Well, I
don't know about that,� she answered coyly, �There might be a lot about this
place you don't know, but you're right, maybe I'm wrong.� Either way, let's head inside before we
freeze out here.�


 


����������� As we
climbed out of the car, a young woman opened the shop door to meet us.� She was definitely on the plump side of
things, and wearing a very fetching feminine version of a bellhop's uniform,
her red hat perched atop her head at a jaunty angle, and her brass buttons
straining to contain her ample bosom.


 


����������� �Welcome to
the Muffin Top, I'm Amy; do you have a reservation with us this evening?� She
asked cheerfully.


 


����������� �Yes, Amy,
right here,� Penny said, producing a printout from her purse that apparently
confirmed her claim, �How are you doing tonight?�


 


����������� �Other than
being frozen in a few places, I've never been better,� the bellhop chirped,
doffing her hat respectfully, �But just because I'm getting paid to stand out
in the cold tonight doesn't mean you two should have to.� Here, if you'll be so kind as to lend me your
keys, I'll go ahead and park your truck out back so you won't have to go
walking eight blocks down to the parking deck when you're ready to go home.�


 


����������� �It's okay;
we really don't mind finding a spot on the street,� I averred, as Penny shot me
a sharp look over the tops of her black-rimmed glasses, �I don't want to put
you to any trouble.�


 


����������� �Oh it's no
trouble at all; we've reserved plenty of space behind the building tonight,�
Amy said, politely taking my keys, �Besides, if we do our job right, by the
time you leave you'll appreciate a little privacy on your way out.�


 


����������� And without
another word, she climbed into the truck, started it up, and seamless merged
into the slow-flowing river of traffic behind us.


 


����������� �Well then,
if you're done arguing with the valet,� Penny said wryly as she took my hand,
�Shall we go on inside?�


 


����������� Pushing
through the front door, which seemed curiously wide for a shop as small as this
one, we found ourselves in a dimly lit room.�
I could tell there were other people there; there was the faint murmur
of conversation, the clink of silver on china, but despite the fact that the
place couldn't have been but so large, everyone else seemed comfortably
shrouded in shadow.


 


����������� �Welcome!�
boomed a voice to our right, dripping like honey with Southern hospitality,
�Welcome to the Muffin Top; may I show you to your table?�


 


����������� I looked to
my right, and was struck speechless at what I saw.� There, standing behind a small table was the
most enormous woman I had ever seen.� I
couldn't even begin to take her all in; there was simply too much of her.� Her hips were breathtaking, so full and broad
that I wondered if she could actually be wider than she was tall, while the
waistband of her purple dress, elegantly cut, bulged out to contain a belly so
opulent I was amazed she was even able to stand upright with its weight pulling
her forward.� Even it, however, was overshadowed
by a bosom more lusciously fat than I had laid eyes on.� Her low-cut outfit barely seemed to contain
her bosom, which swelled out nearly as wide as her hips, and hung all the way
to her well-padded waist.� Supported by
some miracle of tailoring, the tops of her massive globes lay just a few inches
below her shoulders, rising and falling as she breathed, and wobbling like
gelatin whenever she moved in the slightest, not that she seemed to be a woman
accustomed to doing anything in a small way.�
Her round face bore a warm, heartfelt smile, like an aunt who always
welcomed you home with something fresh from the oven, and though she looked
very stylish with her dark hair worn up in a slightly old-fashioned way, I got
the impression she was used to dressing a bit more informally, though no less
carefully.� I couldn't really tell how
old she was; everything about her dress seem carefully crafted to make her look
genteelly out of date, but looking at her face (and a few other rather obvious
places) I couldn't be positive whether she was much over thirty, or just if
being utterly massive just really agreed with her.


 


����������� �Yes,
please,� Penny broke in, noticing I was too blinded by the expanse of cleavage
on display to say anything intelligent just now, �Thank you so much for saving
a spot for us tonight.�


 


����������� �Oh, not at
all, thank you for coming to spend such a special evening with us here at the
Muffin Top,� the huge woman smiled, �I'm Mara, the proprietor and ma�tre d' for
the evening; it's a pleasure to have you here.�
Amy already took your car around back, did she?�


 


����������� �Yes ma'am,
she did,� Penny said with a polite nod, �And thank you so much for working us
in tonight; I know you didn't have a lot of spaces available to begin with, and
it means a lot to me that you were willing to make an exception for us.�


 


����������� �Oh, so
that's you, is it?� Mara said with an indulgent smile, glancing knowingly at
Penny and then giving me a disconcerting saucy wink, �Well, after everything
you told me, how could I possibly leave you two out in the cold on Valentine's
Day?� Besides, we weren't planning on
seating anyone right outside the kitchen anyway, gets in the way of the
ambiance for most folks, having Chrissie and me running back and forth all
evening you know, and since you said it wasn't a problem, well, it's just nice
to have another couple here who really want that special Valentine's
experience.� But just listen to me
chattering on; you must be so very eager to get started; here, follow me.�


 


����������� Mara turned,
stepping away from her station and Penny and I both stared in awe.� As staggeringly voluptuous as she was in
front, Mara was even more breathtaking from behind.� Her ass was simply gigantic, so wide that it
made even her lavish waist seem narrow, unbelievably full and round, wobbling
and swaying hypnotically each time the heels of her shoes struck the hard
floor.� With that same knowing smile, she
looked back over one plump shoulder and gently admonished us.


 


����������� �Come along
now; I can't be away from my post for too long,� she reminded us, �Besides,
you'll see plenty more to whet your appetites tonight, I promise you that.�


 


����������� And so we
followed Mara towards the back of the shop, her opulent rump fairly glistening
as the dim light played across the silvery strands woven into her purple
dress.� It was hard to look away from her
winsome figure as she traipsed along before us, but as we passed a few of the
occupied tables, I did steal a glance at their occupants.� 


 


����������� At one a man
and a woman sat happily, each with a wine glass in hand, the suntanned woman
giggling as she leaned forwards, her breasts threatening to spill out of her
red dress.� Had I not just been
introduced to the living marvel that was Mara I would have been spellbound; you
rarely see a woman so brazenly wearing something so completely inadequate to
contain her figure; her dress would have been snug on a very slender girl, and
here she had managed, just barely, to stuff a pair of what were surely G-cups
into it.


 


����������� A little
further we passed near to another couple, two women this time.� One was the very soul of elegance, decked out
in an elegant gown that hugged her curves without revealing too much, while the
other, her blonde hair cut like a pixie, wore a leather jacket that could never
have been big enough to zip up with the figure like hers.� She wore a white crop top, the entire front
of it stretched tight over her huge hangers, the lower edge of it about half an
inch away from revealing a truly stunning amount of underboob.� Her belly was lusciously round, as if she was
pregnant and well overdue, though something about the softness of her figure
told me that her condition had nothing to do with fertility and everything to
do with indulging in other pleasures.� As
we drew near, her companion passed her some sort of a pastry so rich I could
almost taste it from several feet away.�
The busty girl took it lustfully, while her stylish friend shot me the
same kind of conspiratorial look as Mara had.


 


����������� �Here we are
then,� Mara said, pointing to our table, a discreet distance from the others,
with two glasses of water and a large basket of cookies set in the middle, �Why
don't you two have a seat and your server will be with you shortly.�


 


����������� �Of course,�
Penny answered, �Thank you, ma'am.�
Aren't these tables a little big just for couples?�


 


����������� �Well, we
want to make it easy for you to order as much off the menu as you want to,�
Mara explained happily, �So we have ones that are big enough to hold plenty of
food, and maybe a couple other things if you find everything here to your
liking.�


 


����������� After Mara
had shimmered off into the shadows, her every step a marvel to behold, I
realized that Penny had to have seen me staring and tried to think of something
to say.


 


����������� �So, what *is*
the deal with this place?� I asked, �It's like everyone here knows something
that we don't.�


 


����������� �Really? Are
you sure about that?� Penny replied, taking a sip from her glass of water, �I
thought you said you passed by here every day on your way to work?�


 


����������� �Well, yeah,
but I've never actually stopped in,� I said, �You know I don't have much of a sweet
tooth.�


 


����������� �Well, maybe
not, but that doesn't mean you don't have a taste for something else,� Penny
said with the same enigmatic smile, �But you've at least heard of what the
Muffin Top is really all about, haven't you?�


 


����������� �Honey, for
all the completely unproductive ways I spend my free time, puzzling out the
secret meanings of local bakeries is not among them,� I insisted.


 


����������� �Okay, if
you insist,� Penny allowed, draining her glass and glancing about the room as
she selected a cookie and took a thoughtful bite, �Oh look, here's Chrissie
now!�


 


����������� From out of
the shadows came a girl who was, if such a thing were possible, even more
magnificently buxom than Mara.� She wore
her long blonde hair tied back in pigtails that made her look as if she'd have
cut quite a figure in a dirndl, assuming they make them in whatever size she
actually was, and was dressed in an outfit that was sort of a suggestion of a
tuxedo, with appropriate changes made to contain, and highlight, her ravishing
figure.� Where Mara had a sort of
matronly heaviness about her, Chrissie's shape was almost pneumatic.� Her breasts were stupendously massive,
straining to pop the buttons off her taut, low-cut white shirt, her black
jacket cut very artfully to frame their expansive curves.� Her shirt was stretched so tight I could see
the outline of a truly epic lace bra hugging their lower hemispheres.� They rested just atop her luscious belly,
itself so round that I found myself seized by a sudden urge to reach out and
touch it.� I could see the faint outline
of her bellybutton just above the waist of her dark skirt; which was pushed out
so far in front that I could tell her skirt held just as much of her belly as
her top did.� I found myself idly
wondering what she looked like naked; whether her belly would hang lower
without her clothes to keep it bound up, or whether it was every bit as
curvaceous and inviting when Chrissie laid herself bare.� Her hips were scarcely less broad-spreading
than Mara's, though they jiggled less as she walked, as if she had once been
very trim and athletic, and even at her present size, her body retained an echo
of that firmness, unlike Mara, who quivered as if she had been filled to the
brim with jelly.


 


����������� �Hi
there!� I'm Chrissie and I'll be your
server tonight,� she announced brightly, before a canny looked passed across
her face, �Oh- I wasn't expecting it to be *you*; well now, I know you
won't be sorry you came tonight.� So
then, can I get you anything to start while you're looking over the menu?�


 


����������� I knew I
should stop staring as she leaned forwards and plopped a couple menus down in
front of me and Penny, but I just couldn't help myself as Chrissie bent over to
put a straw in my drink and I was suddenly treated to a very close-up view of
infinitely more cleavage than I'd ever seen on one woman before.� Even after she stood back up, waiting
cheerfully for us to speak up, pen poised over her ticket pad, her hands
resting atop her spectacular bust, I was almost too afraid to glance back at
Penny, sure that I had already sunk myself for the evening.� I was amazed to see that far from staring
daggers at me, she was watching Chrissie with a good-humored grin, one eyebrow
arched as if she found my predicament boundlessly entertaining.


 


����������� �Hi
Chrissie, thank you so much for having us tonight,� Penny replied, glancing
down at her menu, �I'm just feeling absolutely famished, so could I start out
with a large pineapple margarita and a strawberry cupcake?�


 


����������� �Ooh, well *someone*
knows what she wants for Valentine's Day,� Chrissie said approvingly, �I'll get
right on that, Ma'am.� And will you be
having anything to start out, sir?�


 


����������� �Oh, um,
give me a second to look at the menu, this is my first time here,� I stammered,
�Or, you know, don't wait for me; I'll just start with a glass of red, please.�


 


����������� �Coming
right up,� our waitress beamed, scribbling our order down on her pad before
bounding off toward the kitchen, the black fabric of her skirt stretched so
tight it almost shone as it struggled to cover her colossal behind.


 


����������� �So, what do
you think so far?� Penny playfully put it to me now that we were alone.


 


����������� �I'm- I'm
not sure what to think,� I said hesitantly, positive that any enthusing about
the proportions of the staff here would land me in even more serious trouble,
�They certainly have a lot of, um, really nice people here.�


 


����������� �Mmm, don't
they, though?� Penny said, picking up another cookie and setting into it
avidly, �Gosh, I can see why it's so hard to get reservations when they do
this; these are amazing!�


 


����������� �So, um, how
exactly did you find out about this place, anyway?� I asked Penny, still
confused that my wife, who was always counting calories, would even know how to
find this place on the map.


 


����������� �Well, you
know, it's right in the heart of Carytown; all us hip young twenty-somethings
know about quirky little spots like this,� Penny explained breezily, �Also, a
girlfriend of mine works at the diner across the street and, full disclosure,
sees you come in at least once a week, order lunch, and then spend the next
hour at one of the tables outside staring at every single girl who walks into
this bakery so hard she says it looks like you're trying to tear their clothes
off with the power of your mind alone.�


 


����������� �Okay,
guilty as charged,� I admitted, realizing that this was something I would be
hearing about for a very, very long time, �I just- I didn't think you'd understand-
I didn't want you to be jealous or mad because I've always been drawn to bigger
girls- I didn't want you to think I didn't love you like you are.�


 


����������� �Here we
are!� Chrissie announced as she flounced over to our table, setting down a
glass of wine in front of me, and proudly thumping down a drink held by an
entire hollowed-out pineapple in front of Penny, topped off by a small paper
parasol, of course, along with a cupcake so large it could have nearly deserved
its name even without the 'cup' part, �Are you two lovebirds ready to order
then?�


 


����������� �Why yes,�
Penny said, �I'll have a key lime pie, one of those delicious looking apple
strudels in the display case over there, and your Valentine's Special, extra-large,
if you please.�


 


����������� �And for you
sir?� Chrissie asked, turning to me inquiringly.


 


����������� �Um, can you
come back to me in a few more minutes,� I said, surprised at how much food
Penny had just ordered for herself and more than a little terrified that
whatever was going on, since she only ate like this when she was really upset
about something.


 


����������� �Right, I'll
get all that on its way in a flash,� Chrissie announced before bouncing off to
her next stop.


 


����������� �Okay, back
to our little talk,� Penny said, taking a long pull from her drink and licking
a generous dollop of pink frosting off her cupcake, �So, where do we go from
here?�


 


����������� �I dunno; I
know I should have been honest with you,� I admitted, noticing her eyes fixed
upon me as she set to attacking her huge dessert with all the vigor of a
starving woman, �Or maybe I should have just been strong enough to not let
temptation get the best of me.� I'll be
better; you can tell your friend across the street to watch for me; I'll never
stop this way again, I promise.�


 


����������� �Well now,
that's quite an apology,� Penny said, licking the last remnants frosting off
her fingers, having all but inhaled the cupcake, �But it would be cruel for me
to leave you hanging like this any longer, and truthfully, I've got a
confession of my own to make.�


 


����������� �What is
it?� I asked, dreading what could be so bad that she was willing to let my own
transgressions slide if it kept the scales balanced between us.


 


����������� �I didn't
find out about this place from my friend, just because you were always stopping
by to enjoy the scenery,� Penny confided, looking subtly relieved, �I've known
about the Muffin Top for a couple of years now, since before we were even
engaged.�


 


����������� �Okay,� I
said, becoming less worried and more confused by her admission, �I don't see
how that's something you need to apologize to me for.�


 


����������� �Well, it's
like this,� Penny explained, fortifying herself with another long draught from
her pineapple, �You may have been lusting after the women who come through this
place every day, but I've been envying them for longer.�


 


����������� �Wait.� Are you serious?� I asked doubtfully.


 


����������� �Oh, I have
never been more serious,� Penny sighed, pausing to collect the remaining
frosting on her plate with a cookie before blissfully devouring it, �All those
hours I spent at the gym to make sure I'd look fabulous in my wedding dress,
all those times I saw you looking at that one really huge girl who lives just
down the block and is always working out in her yard in a tank top and jorts
and I was sure you were staring at her in absolute disgust, all the times I've
been stressed out by work and life and everything; I can't begin to tell you
how hard it was to keep myself from coming in here and just stuffing myself
until the world felt soft and warm around and inside me, to just be set free
from having to be thin and fit and perfect and just be able to indulge myself
and not fret about becoming the fat girl in my yoga class.�


 


����������� �Hang on,� I
said, watching as Penny polished off the rest of her drink, �Are you honestly
telling me you actually want to get fat?�


 


����������� �How about
if instead of giving you an answer,� Penny said, polishing off another cookie
and rising to her feet,� I ask you another one?�
How am I doing?�


 


����������� For a moment
I was confused; this was all just too strange to believe and I didn't know what
Penny was talking about.� And then I saw
it, what I'd been too distracted to notice the whole time we'd been sitting
down, the whole time Penny had been having her fun with me while stuffing down
about five pounds of sweets and a mixed drink the size of a Big Gulp: Penny was
bigger.� Her body had wasted to time in
turning all the calories into fat, and storing it in all the best of places.� Her black sweater strained gently outwards,
now compelled to hold a pair of breasts at least a couple sizes larger than
they had been when we sat down.� The
pleats of her slacks lay less easily as Penny's narrow hips had expanded
outwards by at least a few inches, giving her the beginnings of a very pleasing
hourglass figure.� And her belly, well,
it wasn't that she had gotten fat, not exactly, but instead of hanging loosely
from below her bust to her waist, the fabric of her sweater now clung to a
tummy that, while modest, was still invitingly sensual.� 


 


����������� Penny's eyes
glinted as she soaked up my breathless amazement, and slowly, deliciously, she
gave herself a turn, letting me see how enchantingly her breasts bulged out
from her profile, giving her hips a wiggle as she faced away from me, her now-shapely
behind wobbling invitingly within the tightening confines of her pants, her
panties already pressed into sharp relief against the gray fabric.


 


����������� �No way-
what are you doing- how can you even-� I stammered, so many questions swirling
in my head I didn't know where to begin, �It doesn't hurt, does it?� Is it permanent?�


 


����������� �Well, now,
I guess I don't need to ask if you like your new wife or not, now do I?� Penny
beamed, pausing to dispatch another cookie, plainly delighted that her efforts
were having their intended effect, both on her figure and on her husband, �It's
all in the food of course, well, at least all the sweet stuff, the coffee here
won't add an inch to a girl's figure and it is quite good, I hear.� And don't worry about yourself; it only works
on women, not that you were probably planning on ordering an entire peach
cobbler for yourself.� As for the rest,
if I keep going at this rate I suppose things may start to get a little
uncomfortable as my clothes get too tight, but I did my best to dress for
excess tonight, and as for me, I feel *incredible*.� I wish I'd known you liked big girls back
when we were dating, but then again, I bet it's hard to find a good wedding
dress when your boobs are the size of beach balls, so maybe it's best we waited
until now to uncover each other�s proclivities.�


 


����������� �Beach
balls?� I echoed, as Penny scarfed down another cookie and took another long
pull from her drink.� What she had
already done to herself was already more than I could quite wrap my head
around, but beach balls, just how big was she planning to get?


 


����������� �Oh, am I
not thinking big enough for you, my love?� Penny asked with feigned dismay,
�Well, I suppose if you really want me even *bigger*, you might be able to
talk me into it.� And yes, it is
permanent, though I suppose if you really didn't like me this way, all curvy
and round, I guess a few months of hitting the gym might give me that
rail-thin, waifish figure that all the girls seem so eager to have, but you
don't want that, do you?�


 


����������� �No no,
never, please, do continue,� I assured her fervently, �Like you said, I'm
having a great time; you just go ahead and indulge yourself there, and I'll be
more than content to enjoy the show.� Oh
look, here comes your entree.�


 


����������� �Here we
are; I hope I didn't keep you too waiting too long,� Chrissie said as she set
down a trio of overladen platters in front of Penny, her body jiggling
fetchingly as she set them down heavily, �Oh, and you're almost done with your
drink here, aren't you now?� Don't worry;
I'll be back with another in a jiffy.�
Were you ready to order yet, sir, or should I come back in a few
minutes?�


 


����������� �Oh, no
worries, take your time,� I assured her, far more interested in the way Penny
was salivating over the spread laid before her than I was in ordering my own
supper.


 


����������� �Okay then,
just give me a shout if you need anything,� Chrissie called cheerfully,
bouncing off towards the next table, �I'll check back in a little bit to see if
anyone is ready for seconds.�


 


����������� �That is a
lot of dessert,� I said, an observation that did not exactly illuminate any
secrets.


 


����������� �Mmm, isn't
it though?� Penny asked as she ran a finger along one of the arrayed
confections before licking a healthy dollop of red and pink frosting off of it,
�Ooh, that one tastes so fattening I'd better save it for last so we'll both
have something to look forward to.� You
know, if you think this is a lot, you have no idea just how much I'm planning
on overindulging this evening.� But
enough talking, I'm absolutely famished.�


����������� 


����������� She was a
marvel to behold as Penny took up her fork and set to work on the apple
strudel.� It was so long it hung over
both ends of the platter, dusted with a small mountain of white sugar, the
dough worked so thin it looked like Mara had stuffed it with as much filling as
it could safely hold without bursting and then a little more for good
measure.� As soon as Penny cut into it a
sweet m�lange of apples and spices flowed out onto her plate and dripped over
the edge onto the tablecloth.� As the
first bite passed her lips, she let out a more sensual moan than I'd ever heard
her make outside of the bedroom, and rarely even there.


 


����������� �Mmm, I hope
you're serious about liking *really* big girls,� Penny murmured around a
heaping mouthful of pastry, �Because this is so heavenly, you'll be lucky to
have a wife that can still squeeze through the bedroom door by the time I have
enough of *this*.�


 


����������� �Well now,
I'm not so sure about that,� I told her with a grin, �I'd count myself even
luckier to wind up with a wife too big to stuff her luscious curves through
such a tight place; I'm sure we could make the living room comfortable enough
for you.�


 


����������� �Ohh, okay
then, as long as you're committed,� Penny sighed, stuffing down another huge
chunk of strudel, oblivious to how in her hunger for more several fat drops had
fallen from her fork and landed on the increasingly tight front of her sweater,
�Because I have a feeling I'm not going to be able to stop myself from eating
until I feel like I'm about half a bite away from bursting.�


 


����������� �Well, just
let me know if you start to feel uncomfortable,� I reassured her, �Though if
you do happen to indulge yourself too much, I'd be happy to massage anything
that feels too tight once we get home, no matter how many of those things you
stuff yourself with.�


 


����������� �Oh, don't
encourage me,� Penny gasped, so desperate to glut herself with more of the
sumptuous sweetness on her plate that she could barely spare a moment to
breathe, �I'm already so hooked I'd be enormous by the time I was done here
even if you got up right now and left me alone with my appetite.� If you keep egging me on like this I'm liable
to wind up so fat we'll be able to get rid of our bed and you can just sleep on
top of me.�


 


����������� �What? I
wouldn't dream of that,� I told her, �If we got rid of the bed how would I get
to enjoy the sound of the bed-springs groaning beneath you while I made all
those luscious pounds of yours bounce and jiggle until you were ready to lose
your mind?�


 


����������� �Oh, stop
it,� Penny shot back playfully, �It's hard enough trying to keep myself decent
for a public place like this without you putting ideas in my head when every
bite I take is like the nectar of the gods.�
I can feel my clothes getting tighter by the second; you don't need to
torture me by getting me all turned on too.�


 


����������� She was
right.� As Penny pushed another overladen
forkful of pastry into her mouth, her entire body seemed to bulge outwards slightly;
the way a balloon does when you push down the handle on the air pump.� And thanks to the way she was gorging
herself, Penny's figure was starting to look very well-pumped indeed.� She had to be at least an F cup by now; as
the fabric of her modest top stretched to hold her expanding breasts, I could
clearly see her bra pressed tight between her expanding bust and her top, as
well as the distinct line where her increasingly full boobs bulged out over its
cups.� 


 


����������� �Oh, here,
let me stand up so you can see I've got more than just a fat pair of tits going
on,� Penny smiled as she swallowed the last bite of her apple pastry, �Besides,
I feel like this belt is going to cut me in two if I don't let it out a couple
of notches.�


 


����������� As she
stood, the truth of her words was immediately made manifest.� Her belly, now quite full and round indeed,
bulged out both under and above her belt, overfilling her sweater to the point
that I could see a couple inches of her soft, smooth skin laid bare, while
below it was swiftly expanding to fill the front of her pants.� Her hips had gained another couple of inches;
they swayed hypnotically as she wrestled with her belt buckle, and from the way
her entire lower body jiggled as she struggled, I hardly needed her to turn
around again to know that Penny had fattened up just as much behind as she had
in front.� Her clothes were at war with
themselves, Penny's slacks desperate to slide lower so that they would have to
carry less of her increasingly well-filled figure, while her belt tried to
retreat higher, away from her delightfully broadening hips, with Penny's belly
fat bulging through the gaps where her belt had worked its way higher than the
waist of her pants, looking as if she ate much more it would tear right out of
its loops.


 


����������� She pulled,
almost panting for breath as she sucked in her well-deserved tummy and tried to
undo the tight-drawn buckle, and when she finally succeeded I was rewarded by
the sight of her belly, taking advantage of its new freedom, ballooning out
fully another three inches in front of her, with only the considerable
elasticity of her waistband keeping her pants in one piece.


 


����������� �Oh, ouch,
come on; I wore my longest one,� Penny muttered as she tried to refasten her
belt at the last hole, �There's no way I've put on this much weight already.�


 


����������� �Mmm, you
just stop fighting and enjoy it, sweetie,� Mara said approvingly, as she waddled
up to our table and plunked down another pineapple full of liquor, before
giving Penny an enthusiastic slap on the rump and making her emit a small
shriek of surprise, �Don't even bother about the belt, I've been there before.� The best you'll manage to do is cinch it down
so tight you can hardly breathe, and then as soon as you sit back down again
and have another bite or ten, it'll just snap right off you like the crack of a
whip, and if it catches you someplace tender as it goes, it can leave a nasty
bruise.� Here, you just sit down, enjoy
your meal, and don't leave that key lime pie sitting there looking all alone
and neglected now, okay?�


 


����������� �Oh, it's
all just happening so much faster than I expected,� Penny sighed, sinking into
the chair as Mara pulled it out a few inches further from the table, with a
certain grace that suggested she was very well acquainted indeed with putting
women at ease as their measurements spiraled upwards towards three digits,
�You're right, Mara, I'm even more famished that when we sat down, and that pie
does look absolutely delicious.�


 


����������� �Well then,
I'll leave you kids to it,� Mara said as she turned ponderously and bustled off
to see to her other customers, �You know, I bet Chrissie that by the time
you're done tonight you'll be the biggest woman in the shop by a hundred pounds
or more, not counting the staff of course, and I'm not the kind of woman who
enjoys losing.�


 


����������� As Penny
drew the pie tin towards herself, eyeing it lustfully, I couldn't help but
steal a quick look around to see just how the other diners were faring.� The wine-drinking woman we had passed by the
on way in had certainly not been wasting her time; her breasts had swollen from
G-cups to something well into the latter half of the alphabet, her radiant tan
giving way to a broad swath of far paler flesh as she ballooned out of her
dress, and she looked as if she were about ten seconds from bursting her seams
entirely.� She swayed in her seat
tipsily, and while her date sat with his back to me I could only imagine the
look on his face as she put down her glass just long enough to grab something
dangerously chocolatey-looking and begin the lick the frosting from it as
provocatively as she possibly could.


 


����������� At another
table nearby, one that I had somehow missed on the way in, two college-aged
women giggled as they took turns shoving frosting-laden pastries into each
other�s mouths.� They'd clearly been at
it for some time too, for their clothes were stretched taut over their bloated
breasts and lush bellies, fattened to the point that neither was able to reach
the other by simply leaning forwards across the table.� Rather each had been forced to rise from her
seat, her ample rear stuck out proudly behind her as she fought to reach her
companion, her belly pressing down upon the table, bare skin sticky with the
remnants of a dozen kinds of desserts, breasts barely contained by their almost
transparent tops, hanging lower and fuller as they managed to each deliver a
heaping handful of something dripping with sweetness into the others mouth.


 


����������� �Hey now,
you're supposed to be watching *me* inflate like a balloon,� Penny teased,
pausing with a spoon spilling over with lime filling and cream, �Well, they are
hard to ignore over there; I don't suppose I can be too angry at you for
staring.� I guess there's no help for it
but to gorge myself until I'm even bigger.�
Would you like that, love?� Just
sitting there watching me become fatter and fatter, stuffing myself until my
tits fill my lap, eating until I'm so huge that my slacks are in tatters, the
table digging in against my bloated belly, my sleek, creamy thighs glistening
in the dim light, and every eye in this place fixed on me, mesmerized as I
stuff myself with more and more, silently wondering just how much more I can
possibly take, and with every bite, every second that passes, envying you more
for being the lucky guy who gets to take me home and delight in my voluptuous
charms?� Is that what I have to do to
keep your attention?�


 


����������� �Well, I-� I
stammered, worried that I had offended Penny again.


 


����������� �Don't say
another word,� she insisted, taking another drink and winking coyly, �I
understand completely.� Challenge
accepted.�


 


����������� As I watched
in awe, Penny set about glutting herself with key lime pie faster than I would
have thought humanly possible.� Forkful
upon forkful vanished past her lips; I was amazed she even had time to swallow
it all, much less time to breathe.� And
yet, my wonder at watching her give in to her insatiable hunger faded as I
found my attention drawn to the effects that this binge was having on her body.


 


����������� With every
drop she forced down, Penny grew more tantalizingly well-endowed.� Her breasts, like melons left on the vine
until they grew dangerously ripe, drank up all that richness eagerly, swelling
to ever larger proportions as I watched.�
They were already wider than Penny's chest, which was also far from as
narrow as it had been when we came in, and they seemed to have spilled out of
Penny's bra entirely, overwhelming its small cups beneath their steadily
accruing fullness.� As the black fabric
of her sweater stretched tighter and tighter across them, I could see her
nipples, plump and erect, pressing, almost throbbing within their confinement,
Penny moaning softly to herself as the ribbed weave chafed against her turgid
peaks.� As large as they were becoming,
Penny's breasts still remained seductively round, as if her skin had barely
yielded enough to hold such abundance as she was engorging them with, or perhaps
because even without a bra to lend them support, her sweater was hugging them
against her plump body.� Either way, I
couldn't wait to see their natural shape once she grew too large for her
top.� Penny was barely a third of the way
through the pie, and already they bulged out from her body seductively, their
undersides advancing lower and lower along the crescent of her ever more ample
belly.


 


����������� It was so
easy for me to get lost staring at Penny's breasts I was startled to see how
impressively her boundless appetite was enlarging the rest of her figure.� Her arms, had already plumped up to the point
that they completely filled her sleeves, and were straining her seams them even
further as they fattened.� As Penny shoveled
the pie into her mouth I saw her upper arms wobbling slightly, the effect
growing more irresistible with each bite she took.� 


 


����������� Her sweater
had slipped up high enough in the front now to expose her indecently
fertile-looking belly; she was already beginning to lap out over the waistband
of her overfilled slacks.� She glanced at
me as I rose from my seat, but then realized I was just trying to get a better
view and ardently returned to her dessert.�
As I stepped around the table I could see her hips had grown wider than
her chair, and chairs at the Muffin Top were anything but narrow.� The waist of her slacks was starting to dig
into her bountiful belly just as her belt had, and as I stepped around behind
her I was stunned at how gigantic Penny's ass was becoming.� When she'd showed me her progress the first
time, she had merely gone from flat to agreeably curvy, but this was something
else entirely.� Her slacks clung to her
surfeited behind like a second skin; I could hear them creaking as she loaded
herself with more.� Though the way she
was leaning forward to eat doubtless amplified the effect, her butt now spilled
out several inches behind her, bulging against the bars of the chair back.� Just as in front, Penny's clothes were in
full retreat; a two inch gap already lay bare between the edge of her
over-matched sweater and the waist of her straining pants.� Her skin was temptingly exposed; it was all I
could do to restrain myself from stroking her there, at that place where the
small of her back suddenly bloomed into the fullness of her ballooning
behind.� As she ate, as she grew, I could
even see her panties pulled tight across the breadth of her hips, the pink and
red hearts that covered them now stretched out fully twice as wide as they were
high.


 


����������� Glancing
higher, I saw that her bra, defeated as it was, still clinging tight around
Penny's chest, like a ridiculously narrow corset just below her arms and above
the collection of rolls developing along her sides.� Looking over her shoulders, I was astounded
to see how much bigger her breasts had gotten while I had been admiring the
view from behind.� They were bigger than
her head now, and beginning to press against the edge of the table so that each
bite Penny cut from the pie had to travel farther to reach her lips.� Every time she swallowed, they jiggled
enticingly; I could only imagine how soft and heavy they had to be, and found
myself bewitched by the idea of leading my voluptuous little wife home, Penny
nearly helpless and drunk with excess, and hearing her plead to get some
scissors and cut open her sweater so that her breasts wouldn't be so painfully
constricted.� I could almost hear the
sound of the material splitting all the way up her front as I made the first
cut, and the sight of her huge, pale, quivering melons hanging free and just
begging for attention-


 


����������� �Well now,
how's the view back there?� Penny asked playfully, giving her rump a little
shake as she raised her thick arms above her head and arched her back until I
heard seams popping open, �That takes care of the key lime pie; so am I big
enough for you yet, or should I just keep going until they run out of food
here?�


 


����������� �I wouldn't
dream of getting in your way,� I said as Penny looked back towards me,
shamelessly pleased at how luscious she was becoming, her buxom figure
quivering as she turned halfway in her seat, �Here, give me a second before I
start my next course; my hands seem to have gotten all sticky somehow.�


 


����������� �Don't
worry, I wouldn't miss the next act for a million dollars,� I admitted as Penny
walked by me, rubbing her hand down my chest as she passed, her hips swaying
hypnotically as she walked, her ass wobbling as if she had pumped it full of
jelly.


 


����������� �Good,� she
called back over her plump shoulder, �Half the fun of this is watching you
drool over how fat and sexy I'm getting; I'm just imagining what you're going
to do to me once I've *really* gained a few curves and I can get you to
somewhere a little more private.�


 


����������� As Penny
walked back to the washroom, she walked by the counter where Mara was hard at
work preparing some kind of �clair.� As
Penny approached, Mara took up the free end of a hose attached to a large piece
of kitchen equipment, stuck it into one end of the pastry and squeezed the
release.� There was a soft hissing noise
and in the space of a few seconds the �clair inflated from the size of an apple
to that of a ripe honeydew melon.� Penny
was clearly fascinated by the sight, the sharp rhythm of her heels on the tile
floor growing slow and uneven.� Smiling, Mara
looked up, laying the hose back on the counter and showing the �clair, which
was now leaking glistening white cream from both ends, to Penny.


 


����������� �You know,
these are kind of my specialty,� Mara enthused, holding the �clair closer for
Penny, who seemed practically intoxicated by richness of its aroma, �If you've
saved room for dessert, I could certainly whip another one up for you, provided
you're not already too full by the time you finish your next course there, and
assuming your hubby doesn't mind you getting so splendidly full-figured that
the only two rooms of the house you'll be any use in at all are the kitchen and
the bedroom; the cream in these is *very* fattening.�


 


����������� �Ha, he's
probably over there listening to every word of that and imagining me putting
away a half dozen of them already, � Penny said with a puckish grin, �I'll be
lucky to get back to the table and see he's only ordered two of them for me.�


 


����������� As Penny
closed the door behind her to wash up, Mara bustled behind at the bakery
counter, laying out serving dishes and loading them down with the most
succulent morsels her art could create.�
A minute later when Penny stepped back out again, her hands now free of
whipped cream and pie filling and the upper part of her sweater no longer quite
so liberally adorned with sugar and crumbs, she looked for a moment like she
was going to say something to Mara, but was interrupted by a snap, a plop, a
surprised shriek, and the sound of several dishes clattering to the floor.� The wine-loving woman had finally burst out
of her dress, her huge breasts flopping out onto her table and knocking aside
several mostly empty platters, their tan skin almost demanding an admiring
caress, while each bore a triangle of alabaster white around her areolae, a
souvenir from a bikini now hopelessly too small to accommodate her endowments.� Mara immediately rushed off to attend to her,
though it was clear that the woman and her date were far from alarmed at this
development.


 


����������� As Penny
walked by the now unattended cream machine, she looked at it intently.� She glanced around the dimly lit bakery; Mara
was busy with the wine-woman, whose bared breasts had to be at least three
times as big as Penny's, and Chrissie was nowhere in sight.� With just a moment's hesitation, Penny
grabbed the hose and raised it to her mouth.�
I stared.� Everything in this place
was insanely fattening; if this cream was so rich that even Mara was warning
Penny about it, I could only imagine the effects that pumping it directly down
her throat would have on my wife's body.�
I envisioned Penny just exploding out of her clothes in an instant, her
breasts inflating as if she were filling them from a fire hose, swelling fuller
and heavier until they hung to her waist, as enormous in seconds as the woman
at the other table and then swiftly ballooning to double her size.� I imagined them being lifted up as her belly
billowed out in front of her, fattening until it swelled out just as far as her
vast bosom and hung as low as her knees.�
I thought about her hips blossoming wider and wider, seductively fertile
and inviting, her ass expanding at such a spectacular rate that by the time she
realized how immense she had become Penny would already be too huge to stuff
herself into any chair in the house.


 


����������� �Excuse me,
Ma'am; I'm afraid this area of the bakery is staff only,� Chrissie said, playfully
poking Penny in the small of her back, having appeared seemingly from nowhere.


 


����������� �Oh, I-uh,
of course,� Penny stammered as she dropped the hose and spun around so fast
that her own bust smacked into Chrissie's far more overdeveloped bosom, setting
both women delightfully aquiver, which only got Penny all the more flustered,
�I was just heading back to our table, and I guess I got turned around and
then- I don't know- and you-�


 


����������� �Still
getting used to being a big girl, are we then?� Chrissie said knowingly, �I
remember how that is.� You'll be knocking
things over with your boobs and your butt for the next few weeks until you get
used to having a pair of melons that can knock a man to the floor and hold him
there; and since you've already got a man, he probably wouldn't mind if you did
just that now and then.� Take my word for
it, if you you keep gaining like you have been tonight, you're going to find
there's so much stuff you can do in bed that wasn't even on the menu before,
and *so* much more of your body to explore and enjoy.� Believe me, the first time you have sex after
you hit five hundred pounds is the most mind blowing experience of your entire
life.� At least until you get to six
hundred, and then seven, but you get the idea.�


 


����������� �Thanks,�
Penny sighed, her bosom rising and falling with relief, �I guess I'd better get
back to my table, my husband, and my mission for the evening.�


 


����������� �Hey, don't
worry,� Chrissie said encouragingly, �It's good that you're so eager to grow
tonight, but take my word for it, if you sucked down that stuff for even a few
minutes you'd be riding home tonight on the back of a flatbed truck.� Don't feel like you have to rush yourself;
savor every new pound, every extra inch and every new place that jiggles where
it didn't jiggle before.�


 


����������� �Whew, that
was close,� Penny said as she sank back into her chair across from me and took
a fortifying gulp from her pineapple,� I was afraid she was going to kick us
out or something.�


 


����������� �I don't
know,� I said, �I'm pretty sure they wouldn't leave something like that just
laying out if they didn't ever want anyone to take advantage of it ever.� I wouldn't be surprised if Chrissie or Mara
hadn't spent at least a few minutes alone with that hose; there's no way they
got as huge as they are just overdoing it at the buffet.�


 


����������� �Darling, I
admit nothing,� Mara chuckled as she suddenly appeared at Penny's side, �though
you'd be surprised how far an appetite for sweets and a ready supply of them
can carry a girl.�


 


����������� �Oh, Mara,�
Penny said, �I'm sorry; Chrissie must have told you, I didn't mean to do
anything wrong.� I just couldn't resist.�


 


����������� �Don't give
it another thought, sweetie,� Mara reassured her, patting her on the shoulder
warmly, �This place wouldn't be in business if it weren't for temptation, and
there's nothing wrong with letting yourself surrender to it now and then.�


 


����������� �Thanks,
Mara,� Penny said, looking up at her brightly, �You know, even if I wasn't
hell-bent on getting enormous so my hubby here will stop camping out across the
street to ogle your customers, I think I might just start coming in because
everyone here is so nice and understanding.�


 


����������� �Well now,
that's awful kind of you,� Mara beamed, �Say, if you don't mind me being a
little forward, am I correct in thinking that you mean to walk out of here
tonight with a pair of tits big enough to burst out of that sweater of yours
several times over?�


 


����������� �I-um,
well,� Penny stammered again, blushing a little, �Well, I guess that is kind of
what I was- what he- what we were hoping for.�


 


����������� �Good, here
you go then,� Mara said, as she plunged her arm elbow-deep in her cleavage and
drew out a can of something, �I noticed you've still got the Valentine's Day
Special in front of you, and I can tell you from *extensive* personal
experience that it is ever so much better with a little whipped cream on
it.� It's my own special recipe; the
richest, most decadent mix I know how to make; lighter than air, and so full of
heavy cream you might as just dip your dessert in butter.� Sorry if it's a touch warm, a girl my size
tends to get a little overheated bustling around on nights like this and
keeping a cold can or two of it tucked in between my girls here helps keep me
cool.� Why don't you just hang on to it
for now; I've got plenty more stashed away if anyone else wants some, and that
way you can just have as much as you like.�


 


����������� �Oh, thank
you,� Penny enthused, receiving it gratefully;� I promise I'll make good use of
it.�


 


����������� �I'm sure
you'll take the fullest advantage of it,� Mara replied, before glancing down at
Penny and frowning a little, �Oh no, dear, are you still wearing your bra?� Honey, if you get much bigger you're not
going to be able to breathe with that thing squeezing the life out of you.� Here, let me lend you a hand.�


 


����������� Without
waiting for an answer, Mara pressed her plump fingers against the middle of
Penny's back and snapped them, unleashing a wobbling avalanche as she expertly
unhooked Penny's bra.� Then, as if it
were something she'd done a thousand times before, she leaned forwards, almost enveloping
Penny in her cleavage, and reached down the collar of her turtleneck, fishing
out the offending undergarment with ease.�
As big as Penny had already gotten, seeing my wife pressed so deeply
into Mara's bosom showed just how far she still had to go if she wanted to be
the biggest woman in this bakery.


 


����������� �There you
go, sugar,� Mara said cheerfully, as if removing her customers' intimates was
all in a day's work for her, �Now I'll leave you two to enjoy your supper.�


 


����������� �Well then,
what are you waiting for?� I asked Penny, who still looked kind of blissfully
stunned from her close encounter with Mara's billowing curves.


 


����������� �Mmm, you're
right,� Penny agreed, a look of insatiable resolve glinting in her eye, �Before
I let temptation have its way with me any more than I already have; you're sure
that I'm not getting too big for you, right?�


 


����������� �Actually, I
think I'd like to see you keep eating until your boobs are even bigger than our
gracious hostess's over there.�


 


����������� �What?
Mara's?� She's huge!� Penny said
doubtfully, �I think my tits would be ready to burst before I fattened myself
up to *half* her size.�


 


����������� �Come on,
hon,� I pushed, �It's Valentine's Day, why not push yourself a little?� You might be surprised at just how much you
can handle.�


 


����������� �Well then,
if that's the way you want it, I guess I'd better get started,� Penny said with
an eager smile, draining the rest of her drink before she set to work.


 


����������� She tipped
up the can and with a hiss, sprayed a generous dollop of whipped cream onto the
confection in front of her, which already looked like it weighed at least ten
pounds, not counting frosting, the amount of which it supported might best have
been measured in gallons.� A cloying
aroma immediately filled the air.� It was
too ridiculously sweet for my tastes, but as soon as it hit Penny she closed
her eyes and sighed as if she were breathing in distilled pleasure.� She took up a liberal dollop of it on one
finger and popped it into her mouth, sighing contentedly as she slowly drew her
finger from her lips, as if reluctant to let a single molecule of the stuff go
unsavored.� I swear I could see her
figure expanding just from that single taste.


 


����������� �Oh my gosh,
this stuff is like heaven in my mouth,� Penny gushed, a flush of delight
warming her face, �If I put as much of this as I want on this thing, the table
is going to be under half a foot of whipped cream before I empty the can.�


 


����������� �Well now,�
I observed, nodding towards the nozzle pointing towards her face, �If you're
just desperate to get all that inside of you, why make it any more complicated
than you have to?�


 


����������� �Are you
serious?� Penny asked as she took in my suggestion, �I mean, could I really
just put it in my mouth and...�


 


����������� �Mara did
say she had plenty more stashed away in her hiding place there,� I pointed out,
�and when you were standing back there by the Hose of Infinite Fattening you
didn't seem to have any qualms about pumping this kind of stuff right down your
throat.�


 


����������� �Okay,
you've got me sold,� Penny smiled as she raised the nozzle to her lips, �I just
hope you're up to taking care of all the woman your little wife is going to be
by the time she waddles into the bedroom tonight.�


 


����������� Penny pushed
the nozzle into her mouth until the cool metal of the can pressed against her
lips, and pulled it down sharply.� There
was a hiss as whipped cream sprayed into her mouth; her cheeks puffed out as it
came faster than she could swallow.� Over
the next few seconds, as she found her rhythm, sucking down the incoming flood,
the tension in her face melted away, replaced by a look of sheer rapture.� When I glanced down at her body, I was
stunned at just how potent this stuff actually was.


 


����������� Her sweater
was so desperately stretched out that it no longer covered her belly at all,
its edge now pulled tight against the underside of Penny's breasts, making them
look even more buoyantly round than before.�
Each one was easily a foot across now, her confining top squashing them
together awkwardly, so big that even her turtleneck collar was starting to pull
down in the front and reveal the deep, tight cleft between them.� Penny swallowed down the whipped cream
eagerly, her eyes screwed shut with delight, her free hand exploring her
expanding bosom, appreciatively squeezing here, tentatively hefting there,
teasing the growing bulges where her nipples, plump and hard, were doing their
best to pierce the material that imprisoned them, enjoying them before she
became so large that they had swollen beyond her reach.


 


����������� As I
watched, Penny's breasts grew faster; as if whatever miraculous substance the
whipped cream contained had finally saturated her body, soaking her through
from within and leaving her flesh so very supple and submissive, her breasts
primed for growth and desperately thirsty for nourishment.� Indeed, as Penny sucked, the can still
hissing as it pumped its contents into her, her breasts were fairly inflating
with fat.� As they swelled over the edge
of the table, pushing a few emptied dishes out of the way and flecking her top
with frosting and crumbs, I could hear her sweater straining, seams popping one
by one as it grew more overburdened with the entrancing pounds that each
passing second loaded her with.� I
noticed Penny had left off exploring her new assets and that her unoccupied
hand was now pushing its way underneath her huge boobs, not supporting them,
but working its way lower still.� Her
slacks were far too tight for her to slip inside their waistband though, and as
lush as her belly had become, I doubted that she could have reached her mark in
her present position anyway.� She seemed
untroubled by this setback, sighing heavily as she swallowed, rocking her hips
and rubbing the lowest part of her belly she could reach, and all the while
growing more and more provocatively enlarged.


 


����������� With Penny's
breasts piling up on the table in front of her, her sweater stretched almost to
transparency, it finally happened.� With
a loud rip, in the blink of an eye her top was split from neck to navel.� A half second later, Penny's luscious
breasts, now naked, pale and glistening in the dim light, finally free of
support or restraint, fell into her lap with a slap, quaking beguilingly as
they struck.� They filled her lap
completely, and all the space between her body and the table, no longer lapping
over the top quite so dramatically as a moment before, but still very lavishly
indeed.� Though Penny gave a jolt and a
stifled a moan as her burdensome melons fell against her full belly, she didn't
pause for a second, with her head still thrown back in ecstasy, whipped cream
still gushing into her.


 


����������� Though she
was nowhere near as massive as Mara or Chrissie, the sight of my wife sitting
there, her breasts so utterly exposed and so spectacularly overfilled was
indescribable.� As Penny expectantly
caressed one huge breast, nudging it towards a more comfortable position, I
tried to imagine how much each one of them had to weigh now.� It had to be at least sixty pounds, and for
all I knew, considerably more, though their full and gentle curves made them
appear far less of a burden then such numbers would suggest.� I watched as, like twin rising suns, the
borders of Penny's rosy areolae slipped into view above the table as the mass
of breast flesh below them accumulated.�
Each one had to be at least three inches across, seductively
overdeveloped compared to the small cherry-hued halos I was so familiar
with.� At last, as Penny gave a shudder
that set her bloated breasts trembling alluringly, the sound of whipped cream
coursing into her body ebbed until, with one last wistful swallow, Penny drew
the nozzle from her lips, and looked down at the tremulous panorama of flesh
spread out before her.


 


����������� �Oh my-� she
gasped, dropping the empty can and stroking her bosom as if she doubted what
she saw could be real, �I- I could feel myself getting huge, filling up my lap,
getting heavier and heavier, but these- just look at me; my tits are massive!�


 


����������� �I haven't
taken my eyes off you since you started,� I insisted, Penny's expression of
utter shock and wonder making the whole scene even more enjoyable.


 


����������� �Okay, I've-
I need to get a better look at these monsters,� Penny said, still staring in
awe at her enormously fattened breasts, �Here, help me lift them onto the
table; my nipples are rubbing against the edge and they're so sensitive right now
I feel like I'm going to explode if I don't get some relief.�


 


����������� �You want me
to help lift your boobs onto the table?� I asked numbly, too overwhelmed to
really even process her command.


 


����������� �Well, I'm
sure you'll be handling them plenty once we get home, so no time like the
present,� Penny replied with a willing smile, �I'll need help, of course,
stuffing them into my top when we're going out somewhere, squeezing them into
the car enough that you can close the door without pinching anything tender,
not to mention that you're going to have to take care of pretty much all my
buttoning and unbuttoning from now on, as well as helping me soap these up in
the shower and of course, you might be tempted now and then to feel me up
purely for for our mutual enjoyment.�
Besides, I'm just starving for more and there's no way I'll be able to
keep stuffing myself with half a ton of boobs between me and my dessert.�


 


����������� �Yes ma'am,�
I agreed, mirroring her smile as I rose from my seat, came to Penny's side of
the table and, after a moment of gratitude that this should be my lot in life,
I reached, as delicately as I could, under Penny's bust and trying not to throw
my back out, hefted her swollen breasts onto the table, first one, and then the
other.


 


����������� She was a
vision, a veritable angel of opulence, her mammoth melons resting level with
her chin, covering a goodly portion of the table, and quaking gently as she
breathed, every little movement of her body tugging at their mass in the most
seductive way.


 


����������� �Oh, I'm
even bigger than I thought,� Penny sighed in awe, petting her overladen globes
with naked delight, �No wonder I don't feel like I gained much weight anywhere
else; every last ounce of that whipped cream went straight to my tits!�


 


����������� �Well now,
what were you expecting?� Mara said as she came gliding over, a proud look of
satisfaction illuminating her round face face, �It is cream after all, and all
that milk, especially so rich as I like to make it, well, it's only natural
that it should stimulate a girl's mammary development.�


 


����������� �Mara!�
Penny answered in playful accusation, �you *knew* I was going to swallow
it all, didn't you?�


 


����������� �What, how
would I have guessed after that trick you nearly pulled back with the pastry
pump?� Mara said innocently, �The moment you two walked in the door I knew you
had your heart set on fattening yourself up to the zenith of excess.� Besides, I've got that bet with Chrissie
going on, you know, and if you end up as our biggest customer tonight, she has
to take a turn with the filling machine.�


 


����������� �Really?�
Both Penny and I asked at the same moment, though our interest may not have
sprung from quite the same place.


 


����������� �Oh yes,
it's just a friendly little competition we have every year,� Mara said warmly,
�I can hardly wait to see her burst out of that little tuxedo of hers after we
close down, those hypertrophied tits of hers gaining another hundred pounds or
so in the first minute.� If I'm feeling
generous, I'll let her stop after than, if she gives me that sassy look she did
after our wager at the picnic- well, she'll be in no condition to resist by the
time I finally tell her she's allowed to stop swallowing.� Not that it would be the end of the world if
I lost, mind you, and not just because Chrissie can be such delightful fun when
I'm the one begging for mercy while I feel my poor belly straining to hold
gallon after gallon of the stuff.� I'm
far from opposed to overindulging, as you probably noticed, but I've only just
gotten rid of the stretchmarks from last year when Chrissie won, and as much as
I like having a rump almost as wide as I am tall, I'm in no rush to pay for
widening all the doors in the bakery *again*, and I'm just as happy not to
have my girls aching with fullness like they're ready to burst for the next few
weeks while I get used to being even more sinfully voluptuous than I already
am.� They're already so distractingly tender;
sometimes it's already hard to keep my mind on my business when I have to
squeeze myself behind the counter there.��
Here then, let me get you out of those rags, my dear.�


 


����������� Once more,
without waiting for an answer, to say nothing of permission, Mara produced a
pair of scissors from somewhere about herself and set about liberating Penny
from the remains of her sweater.� As Mara
confidently cut away, it was thrilling to see even more of Penny's luscious
body exposed; how plump and thick her arms had grown, how full and soft her
shoulders had become, the way the well-padded softness of her chest gave way to
her gigantic breasts a few inches below her collarbone, which was now hidden
beneath a generous layer of fat.


 


����������� �There we
are, much better,� Mara said, giving one of Penny's tumescent breasts an
approving pat on its side as she surveyed her work, �Just look at how you're
coming along, dear; if you keep this up you'll be as big in front as my head
waitress and as well-blessed behind as I am in no time.� Oh, and here, let me get you some extra
napkins for that before I toddle off.�


 


����������� �For what?�
Penny asked, glancing about to see if she had caused any spills.


 


����������� �Why for
your milk, of course,� Mara answered matter of factly, �Unless you like leaking
all over the tablecloth like that, and far be it for me to judge what a girl
prefers to do with her own body, however much of it there might be.�


 


����������� �Holy cow,
she's right,� I said with a start: each of Penny's nipples had a small but
steady stream of milk dribbling from it, moistening the skin of her breasts as
the creamy rivulets found their way to the table, a small puddle already
collecting where they met beneath each swollen peak.


 


����������� �Wait, my
tits are full of milk?� Penny exclaimed, grabbing her lush bosom with both
hands and pulling them back warm and slippery, �I mean, how is this happening?�


 


����������� �Well now,
like I said, �Mara explained, giving one of Penny's breasts a playful squeeze
that caused a gout of milk to spurt several inches from her nipple, �You just
swallowed more whipped cream in one sitting than most of my customers do in a
month, and as organic as we try to be here, that's still an awful lot of very
powerful hormones being pumped into your breasts when they're already in such a
suggestible state, and well, it's hardly a surprise, now is it?�


 


����������� �Is it
permanent?� Penny asked, seeming far less distraught at the idea than I would
have expected, �Are my boobs going to keep filling up with milk from now
on?� How often am I going to have to, you
know, relieve the pressure?�


 


����������� �Well, that
depends,� Mara said with a knowing glance in my direction, �If you'd prefer not
to have to milk yourself every morning and just enjoy having an enormous pair
of breasts without all the work of being your own dairy, you can just leave
them be; they're probably start to get pretty uncomfortable over the next few
days as your breasts grow fuller and fuller; it's not at all unusual to hear it
sloshing around inside you after the third day or so, but sooner or later your
body will get the message and you'll stop producing, though forcing your
breasts to stretch out enough to hold a week's worth of milk will probably
leave you a good bit bigger up top than you already are.� On the other hand, you could make your peace
the idea of milking yourself.�


 


����������� �Meaning
what exactly?� Penny asked, looking more and more intrigued as the puddles
beneath her nipples grew steadily larger.


 


����������� �Oh, interested
in that, are we, dear?� Mara said with feigned surprise, �Well, if you
encourage your body to produce more, milking yourself whenever your breasts
start feeling full, maybe even sucking on them when they're not aching for
relief, you'll just start to make more and more.� If you really work at it and eat a rich
enough diet, you'd be amazed how much milk a blooming young woman like you can
produce.�


 


����������� �Just how
much are we talking about?� Penny asked, now hanging on Mara's every word.


 


����������� �For
example, there's one of our regulars, Emily, you rather remind me of her, come
to think of it, and about year ago now, she did the same thing you just did,
downed a whole can of whipped cream all in�
one sitting, and well, she went and bought the most powerful breast pump
she could find.� She had to go searching
for a doctor who would prescribe one for her, actually, I understand they
usually only give them to women who who are lactating so much its making it
hard for them to get on with their lives, and she went home and just slapped
those cups on and let it run a good twelve hours a day, pumping away at her
whether she had any milk to give or not, sitting around the house, playing
video games, and eating the most fattening stuff imaginable.� We do deliver, if you're curious, and by the
time the month was out she was producing five gallons a day.�


 


����������� �A day?� I
asked, shocked that such a thing was even possible, and only too eager to learn
more.


 


����������� �Oh, but
that was just the beginning,� Mara continued, with a practiced storyteller's
ease, �Emily just never let up, wearing the pump to bed, taking all sorts of
supplements to increase her production.�
Why, she was in here just last week and mentioned that she's up to
twenty gallons a day now.�


 


����������� �That's
crazy,� I breathed, looking at Penny and just imagining her breasts filling up
that much milk every day, a thought she was evidently sharing as she stared
down at her milky globes, her face alight with potential.


 


����������� �I won't lie
to you, she's certainly got her share of challenges to deal with,� Mara
admitted, �Emily's told me she's come to the point where if she doesn't get a
thorough milking every six hours at least, her breasts swell up awfully, so
uncomfortably taut she says feels ready to explode, with so much pressure built
up inside that even with her breasts leaking like spigots it doesn't relieve
the strain because she just fills herself up to capacity so quickly
anymore.� So yes, you do have to make
certain sacrifices if that's the life you decide to choose, but on the other
hand, there are a few perks, and she's made the most of them.�


 


����������� �What do you
mean?� Penny asked curiously.


 


����������� �Not to
mince words,� Mara stated, �but once a woman gets to be a certain size, it gets
hard for her to keep a normal job.� Not
that my cooking takes a toll on your health; I only make the best stuff for my
customers, but it's difficult to hold down an office job when you don't fit in
a cubicle anymore, so unless you just happen to be wealthy, or have a husband
who doesn't mind working all day while you stay home stuffing yourself and
wallowing in your body's own bounteous pleasures, it's nice to be bringing in
at least a little cash, and it turns out that the market for breast milk is
very lucrative indeed.� In fact, on her
last visit Emily confided to me that if she keeps going at this rate for
another six months, she'll be able to live quite comfortably on what she's
packed away for the rest of her life, even with her grocery bills being towards
the high side of astronomical and the fact that she's been needing to buy a new
bed every three months or so as they keep giving out under her, though from
what I've heard of how she likes to spend her evenings, I can't say that's much
of a surprise.�


 


����������� �Is she
planning on letting her milk run out then?� Penny asked, spellbound, �After
she's got enough to live on, I mean.�


 


����������� �Oh no,�
Mara said with a chuckle that set her matronly figure aquiver, �She loves it so
much I don't think she could quit it if she wanted to now, the way it feels
having all that warm milk pulsing through her plumped up peaks as she empties
herself, the way she can feel it sloshing around inside her breasts when she
rolls over in the middle of the night, and the sensation of the pressure
building and building inside of her when she decides to go a little longer than
usual between her sessions with the pump is apparently quite stimulating as
well, she has mentioned.� It probably
doesn't hurt that Emily's beau is very much a fan sharing the bed with a woman
who could serve as wet nurse for a decent-sized city with plenty to spare, so
it's not just the pump that's sucking it out of her either.� So yes, if that's where your desires lie, you
might want to heave those udders up into the kitchen sink and squeeze out every
last drop before you go to bed tonight, though I've heard it's a lot more fun
to pour yourself a nice glass of wine, light a candle or two and retire to the
bathtub with someone who doesn't mind helping giving you a hand or two.� Honestly, a milk bath is the best thing in
the world for your complexion; Emily does it all the time and even though she's
almost as big as I am, at least around milking time, her skin is so perfect I
could just scream, while my girls are so overstuffed I can just take my bra off
in front of the mirror and watch myself developing new stretchmarks.� But some girls have all the luck, so I won't
bother you with *my* troubles.�
Anyways, I think I see another table getting ready to leave and I need
to send them off properly, so I'd best be attending to my other customers;
besides, it looks like you've still got a whole platter of something to finish
off before you're done, not that I can tell what it is under all that whipped
cream.�


 


����������� �Well, it
looks like my fat, milky boobs are too big for me to reach past, and I feel
like trying to balance that platter in my cleavage would end up getting messy
in a hurry,� Penny said as Mara shimmered off into the shadows, �I don't
suppose you'd mind doing the honors and feeding this last one to me?�


 


����������� �How are you
still hungry after all this?� I asked, not so much as a reproach but out of
simple amazement.


 


����������� �I don't
even know,� Penny laughed, �I know I should be stuffed to the gills after
having as much as I've eaten tonight, laying on the floor, clutching my belly
and trying not to move, but somehow I'm not.�
I mean, I'm full, but it's an 'Oh, I know I know I should to stop now,
but everything just looks so good and after all, what harm could a little more
do?' sort of full.� Now that you mention
it though, the thought of feeling myself stuffed to the absolute limit, my
belly creaking with every bite I take, so full I can hardly breathe does sound
rather tempting.�


 


����������� �I'm not
sure that mountain of sugar, frosting and whipped cream there counts as 'a
little more',� I averred, poking at the confection and trying to find something
solid beneath the ample layer of cream Penny had loaded it with, �but if you've
still got room, I suppose I wouldn't mind helping you out.�


 


����������� Before Penny
could agree, there was a groan and a sigh from the table nearest to us.� She and I both glanced over as the
wine-loving woman rose unsteadily to her feet.�
Her breasts were massive and pendulous, hanging past her waist though
quite full and broad-swelling all the same, and it was obvious that between all
their extra weight and having put away something more than one bottle of wine
over the last couple of hours, she was having a very hard time keeping her
balance.� Her companion seemed to be
struggling to find a dignified way to grab her low-hanging melons in the middle
of a restaurant without looking too brazen, and finally, with the help of Amy
the valet, her cheeks rosy from an evening parking cars in the cold, they
managed to prop her up between themselves as they practically dragged her to the
back door of the bakery, her swollen breasts swaying and jiggling
unrestrainedly as she staggered through the door.


 


����������� �Put your
eyes back in your head, mister, and pick up that fork� Penny told me with a
smile, �By the time you're done with me, a pair of boobs like hers is going to
be nothing compared to what you'll have to help *me* haul around.�


 


����������� I'd always
liked how Penny knows what she wants and goes right for it.� I grabbed the fork, dripping with frosting,
and brought it to her waiting mouth.


 


����������� �Mmm, that *is*
rich,� Penny murmured as she swallowed, the confection being so soft it barely
called for chewing, �Oh, I can feel my slacks getting tighter already.� Come on then, hurry, there's still so much to
go.�


 


����������� I could
hardly refuse, so I fed Penny bite after bite of dessert, her sighs of pleasure
punctuated by the creak of her pants straining as her body grew more divinely
overladen.� While the whipped cream had
nourished only Penny's bust, this new dish was rapidly making up the difference
for the rest of her figure.� With her
breasts resting on the table, I could see Penny's belly growing larger and
larger as I fed her, lapping out over the waist of her overtaxed pants and
filling every last inch of them below it, until the material was stretched so
tight it gleamed.� Her hips inched out
wider and wider as she gorged, sumptuously spilling over the sides of her
chair, while her fattening ass forced Penny to drag herself nearer and nearer
to the edge of her seat as the space behind her overflowed with her ballooning
cheeks.� All the whipped cream she had
loaded this platter down with was having an effect as well; with Penny's
milk-laden breasts grew more tumescent as she ate, laid out fat and trembling
on the table in front of her as her nipples, each one now fully as thick as her
thumb and half as long, leaked a steady flow of milk, which had finally begun
to drip off the table and puddle on the floor.


 


����������� �Oh, I'm
just getting so tight all over,� Penny gasped as I raised a particularly
generous bite to her lips, �I can hardly breathe.�


 


����������� As if on
cue, her slacks finally ruptured, their waistband giving way with a snap, and
the rest of their over-strained material ripping apart easily as Penny exploded
out of them.� Penny's fulsome figure
surged outwards, her hips and butt bulging out several inches wider, leaving
Penny sitting a little lower in her chair than before, while her belly rolled
out onto her sleek, juicy thighs, its weight and fullness forcing them sharply
apart.� I noticed that she had kicked her
shoes off already; even Penny's ankles were thicker than her thighs had been
when we came in, the only thing she still wore apart from her wedding band
(which was growing rather snug) and her dark-rimmed glasses were her
scandalously overstretched panties, now forced to cover such a stupendous
expanse of jigglesome flesh that if I hadn't known they were covered in hearts
I wouldn't have been able to tell what those faded red and pink blotches were,
stippled across the white material that strained across the small of Penny's
back just above where her body went from voluptuous to salaciously pear-shaped.


 


����������� �Mmm, that's
better,� Penny sighed contentedly, giving herself a satisfied smack on the rump
that sent lazy ripples coursing through its bulk, �Now then, back to work; I
want you to fill me up to the brim.� I
want you to cram it into my mouth so fast I couldn't cry stop even if I wanted
to.� I want to feel my belly stretching
while you stuff me so exquisitely full I'm ready to lose my mind; I don't want
you to stop until every last bite of that cake is inside me, until I'm so
unbearably engorged with excess that I can barely waddle out the door.�


 


����������� �Well then,
I guess I'd be rude to refuse my wife's wishes on Valentine's Day,� I answered
cheerfully, giving one of Penny's glistening nipples a pinch that sent a thick
gout of milk spurting across the table, �You know, I am really looking forward
to helping you with these tonight.�


 


����������� �Not nearly
as much as I'm looking forward to you helping me pump them dry,� Penny replied,
massaging her breasts tenderly, �All this pressure inside my boobs is getting
awfully distracting, not that it isn't more than a little stimulating.� Come on, keep going.� I'm can't tell you how eager to see just how
big I'll be by the time you force the last bite of that down my throat.�


 


����������� Penny
continued to plow her way through dessert as I fairly shoveled it into
her.� By the time she'd finished half of
it, her hips were nearly as wide as her bosom, the seat of her chair completely
overcome by the lushness of her figure.�
Her ass was practically inflating with fat, now just a few inches below
the top edge of the back of her chair, wobbling as if she was pumped full of
every drop of� jelly as her tender skin
could endure.� Her thighs now rubbed against
the underside of the table, and where her breasts had once pressed against its
edge, now her ballooning belly did, fattened to the point where even with her
breasts resting on the table, it was beginning to push up against them from
below.� An hour ago the idea of Penny
sporting a pair of breasts the size of beachballs had seemed impossibly
excessive, as if seeing her grown to such an abnormal degree was more than I
should dream of, much less expect to see, but she had easily grown beyond such
dimensions now, and while being loaded with milk was making her breasts grow
firmer it was clear that bulk of their added weight stemmed from being glutted
with flesh instead of cream.� They were
spread out on the table, so very soft and inviting; her cleavage swiftly
becoming the sort of place a fellow could get quite pleasantly lost in.� The sole obstacle to her overfilled figure's
freedom was her panties, now stretched to translucence and all but overwhelmed
by the lavishness of her body.� In the
front, their straining waistband was buried under the magnificence of Penny's
gorgeous belly, while at her sides, it was dug in between her billowing hips
and the ample rolls that spilled out over them.�
Even in the back, her ass had become so tremendously fat that soon all I
could see of was a single, overdrawn triangle of fabric, pulled impossibly
tight, just above and between Penny's extravagantly overfed cheeks.


 


����������� �Oh my gosh;
I'm in heaven,� Penny gasped as I paused for a moment to let her catch her
breath, her entire body quivering seductively as she inhaled, �I'm just getting
so *huge*; I had no idea how much of a turn-on this would be for me.� Maybe it's because I've had about half a
gallon of pineapple-flavored booze, or maybe it's because these panties are
starting to get *awfully* tight down in front, I'm afraid you're going to
have to have to take drastic measures if you don't want me to keep gaining
weight after tonight.�


 


����������� �Well, if by
drastic measures you mean bringing you here a couple times a week, telling you
not to worry about the bill, and then sitting back and watching as you fatten
yourself into even more of a goddess than you already are, I suppose I might be
willing,� I answered with a smile, and another mouthful of pastry, �But for
right now, why don't you be a good girl and eat the rest of your dessert?�


 


����������� �Mmm,
anything you say,� Penny purred, her face, though rounder and fuller-cheeked
than before still every bit as comely as before, though she was starting to
show the beginnings of a double chin, �You just keep filling your little wife
up until she's fit to burst.�


 


����������� And so I
did.� Every bite rendered Penny's figure
more luscious, every opulent pound, every heavy-swelling roll of her belly
exciting her more.� Though she still had
a ways to go before she was the size of Mara or Chrissie, Penny had definitely
surpassed any other woman I'd ever seen before, especially with her
already-enormous breasts forswollen with who knows how many gallons of
milk.� As she stuffed down the last
quarter of the pan, I could hear her chair creaking under her burgeoning
weight.� Her belly was lifting her
breasts more and more; rising up beneath them and softly but inexorably
spreading them apart, which was just as well, because they had grown to the
point where they rose higher than Penny's shoulders and were starting to press
against her neck.� If it weren't for the
table, her belly would have spilled past her knees by now, her breasts having
passed that point some time before.�
Penny's titanic ass, becoming more replete with fat with each bite she
took, had grown to the point where it had all but pushed her off the front edge
of her seat; I could see her plump legs held tense and trembling as she
struggled to keep herself balanced, the effort causing her to softer regions to
wobble bewitchingly.


 


����������� As the last
bite passed her lips, I gazed in awe at how breathtaking Penny had become.� Even in my search for the biggest of BBWs, I
had never seen such a gorgeous expanse of naked womanliness as I now saw seated
next to me.� Penny moaned with
satisfaction, her breasts distended to the point that they covered more than
half the table, her belly spreading desperately in every direction it could
expand, out to her sides, rising up beneath her massive bosom, forcing its way
down between her sumptuous thighs, while her ass was so tantalizingly
overstuffed that it threatened to spill over the top of her chair, its glorious
excess piling up to kiss the small of her back until the only sign I had that
her panties had somehow held out against such an onslaught was the fact that I
hadn't heard anything tearing lately, and the way that Penny's breath came in
short, ragged bursts suggested that their maddening tightness had only grown
more acute while I filled her with more.�
Her breasts each measured fully two feet across and rose from the table
nearly as high; with her areolae drawn out as wide as tea saucers and her
nipples throbbing as they swelled to the size of wine corks.� She was leaking milk at such a rate I
imagined a drinking glass placed beneath one of her turgid peaks would be full
to overflowing in minutes, and the floor around our table was becoming so
slippery with milk that I half expected Mara or Chrissie to show up with a
�Caution, Wet Floor� sign.� Savoring her
last bite, Penny smiled at me.


 


����������� �This,� she
began breathlessly, �has been the best Valentine's Day of my life.� I came here to become your dream woman, and
indulge myself a little, but I have to admit, somewhere along the way I seem to
have become mine.� Remind me not to be so
doubtful next time I stumble across some kinky thing you're into to.�


 


����������� �Don't
worry, I'll be more forthcoming in the future,� I agreed, still trying to wrap
my head around just how massive Penny had grown.


 


����������� �Well then,
it looks like you just joined the Clean Plate club,� Chrissie observed as she
glided over to our table, �I'd ask if you wanted to order dessert, and I'd be
sorely tempted to stay here and watch you while you ate every last bite of it,
but I'm afraid we're getting ready to close up for the night; everyone else has
already paid their tab and checked out.�
If there's anything else I can get for you though, I'm all too happy to
oblige, and don't forget we open up tomorrow morning at eight o'clock sharp, if
you're feeling a bit hungry after whatever you happen to spend tonight doing
together.�


 


����������� �Oh, it's
just as well,� Penny admitted, �I'm too full for my own good already, and if
you were open for another hour I don't think I'd be able to stop myself from
ordering one of those eclairs that Mara warned me about.� I'd love to find out just how much more my
body could hold before I had to admit defeat.�
Here, let me just get my- hmm- ooh- honey, would you get my purse and
hand this lovely young woman my credit card?�


 


����������� I reached
down and grabbed Penny's purse from under her chair.� It had been so easy for her to place it there
when we first sat down at the table, and now it lay hopelessly beyond her
reach, the shore of a growing pool of milk beginning to lick at its base.� I fumbled inside of it for a moment, trying
to find her wallet, and upon meeting with success, retrieved her card and
passed it to Chrissie, who received it politely, leaning forward in the process
to display enough cleavage to make me wish that the bakery were open for a few
hours more so that I could try to build Penny up to our waitress's spectacular
proportions.


 


����������� �Here we
go-,� Chrissie chirped as she slid the card through her phone, printing off a
receipt and passing it to Penny, along with a pen and her order pad, �Just sign
here and you're all good to go.�


 


����������� Bearing down
on the pad Chrissie had handed her, Penny laid the receipt on top of her right
breast and signed it, as I wondered just how many everyday tasks in her life
would now be so enticingly challenging for her.


 


����������� �Here, and
thank you ever so much for your hospitality,� Penny effused as she handed it
back, �Everything was simply delicious.�
We will definitely be coming back again and I'll be sure to tell all my
friends, well at least all the ones who I think might appreciate your singular
offerings, about this establishment.�


 


����������� �Thank you,
ma'am,� Chrissie said with a smile, folding up the receipt and pad around the
pen and stashing them in the depths of her bosom, �We are only too pleased to
serve any desires you may have.�


 


����������� Penny moved
to stand up, something she hadn't attempted since she was several hundred
pounds lighter.� Getting off her seat was
easy enough; it was only with effort that she had managed to stay balanced on
top of her quaking derriere in the first place, but as she stood up, her legs
now forced for the first time to hold up her ponderously sensual form, her
knees trembled as she struggled to meet the challenge of supporting her
newly-earned curves.� Her belly dropped
with a smack against her thighs, hanging almost down to her knees, while
bulging out in front of her even more impressively.� Her breasts, protesting as she dragged them
off the table, fell hard, slapping against her belly like a pair of Mara's most
overstuffed eclairs, dangerously overfilled with cream as two fountains of milk
sprayed from them as they stuck her soft, yielding body.� As she turned, her ass wobbled as if beholden
to its own laws of motion, quaking and rippling fully five seconds after the
rest of her body moved, drawing out the aftershocks of Penny's slightest
movement alluringly.


 


����������� �Well now,
it seems I've won the night's wager,� Mara said as she sauntered over, shooting
a concupiscent glance towards Chrissie, �Here now, Amy's brought your truck
around to the back so you'll have a bit of privacy instead of stepping out onto
the street in quite such an exposed condition.�
Oh, and it's so very cold out tonight; I hate to send a girl, even one
so very well insulated as yourself out into the cold if only for a minute.� I've laid out some of Chrissie's old workout
clothes in the washroom; why don't you pop in and try them on?� They won't do much to protect your modesty,
what little of it remains now that our work is done, but if you happen to get
pulled over on the way home for speeding, not that I would dare to guess you
might be in a hurry to get back to the privacy of your own home, they should at
least keep you from arousing too much curiosity.�


 


����������� �Oh, thank
you, Mara,� Penny gushed as she swayed through the door, �I'll have to think of
a way to pay back your generosity.�


 


����������� �Oh, don't
worry about that, dear,� Mara chuckled as Penny closed the door, positively
leering at her tuxedoed waitress before turning to address me, �I'll have more
than enough reward when Chrissie here receives her wages for the night.� So then, I hope tonight hasn't been too
disappointing for you?�


 


����������� �Oh, no, not
all all,� I stammered, still fighting to look Mara in the eye and now allow my
gaze to wander to any number of other interesting views a woman of her size had
to offer, �Believe me, I'm done with hanging out across the street; next time
you see me it'll be as a paying customer, with my better half right beside me.�


 


����������� �Marvelous!�
Mara smiled, clapping her plump hands together atop her gigantic bosom, �If
you're really feeling adventurous, next time order an eclair, but only if your
better half is really serious about that whole breast milk for fun and profit
thing.�


 


����������� �Okay, I'm
decent enough for the ride home, at least,� Penny declared as she stepped out
of the washroom, �These are awfully tight though love, so you might want to
hurry before I burst of of them too.�


 


����������� Penny was
wearing a pair of yoga pants stretched taut across her skin, their waistband
coming in just above her massive ass, and straining to contain the lower
portion of her belly, while above she wore a Muffin Top T-shirt, pulled so
tight I could barely read the writing on it, two dark spots already developing
where her fat nipples rebelled against its constraint.


 


����������� �Well, I think
you'd better get home before you explode out of those too,� Mara warned Penny
admiringly, �But once you're back at your place, you might enjoy a few of
these.�


 


����������� What's
this?� Penny asked, hesitantly taking the bulging white paper bag Mara offered
her.


 


����������� �Oh, just a
bit of a parting gift,� Mara demurred, �Something that the woman who wins
Valentine's Day at the Muffin Top gets every year, though I have to admit,
since I like you so very much, and Chrissie tells me you're a very generous
tipper, I may have put a little bit extra in there for you to enjoy.� Just be mindful, the chocolates are harmless
enough, just a few thousand calories each, but the others in there- well, some
of them have the most deliciously naughty effects on a girl.�


 


����������� �Like what?�
Penny asked, clutching the bag as if it were filled with wishes just waiting to
be granted.


 


����������� �Come now,
where's the fun in me just telling you?� Mara laughed, as she waved us out the
door into the small parking lot behind the bakery, where our truck was already
parked and running, �You're a smart girl; I bet you can figure it out if you
try.� And if you're really feeling that
impatient, I suppose you'll just have to try a few and see what happens.� You two have a lovely evening, alright?� Get on home and do something to keep you warm
on such a cold night.� I do hope it won't
take until next year before you darken our door again!�


 


����������� �Thank you
for everything, Mara,� Penny called back, waving enthusiastically as her
engorged melons swayed and wobbled with abandon, �I promise we'll be back
soon!�


 


����������� The wedge of
light from the kitchen shrinking as the bakery door swung closed, I came around
and opened the passenger side up for Penny.�
Though she had no trouble hefting herself up into the cab, getting all
of her assets to fit inside well enough for me to close the door without
pinching of her more delicate parts was a bit more of a challenge and called
for no small amount of squeezing and lifting.�
Finally getting the door shut, I came around to my side and once again
found myself in awe of just how immense Penny had become.� She filled her side of the cab completely,
and her body seemed in danger of spilling over into mine at the slightest
provocation.� Her hips were so wide now
that even pushing herself tight against her door, they still pressed
irresistibly against me as I settled in.�
Her ass was so tremendously overstuffed that the top of her head brushed
the roof, while even with the seat pushed all the way back, the space between
her body and the console was completely filled by her belly, leaving her
massive breasts piled up on top of the dash, squashed against the windshield,
with only an overstretched shirt to keep any oncoming traffic from catching a
real eyeful.� Only halfway watching the
alley, I put the truck in reverse.


 


����������� �Well, stop
staring at my fat boobs and turn the heat on; my nipples already feel hard
enough to cut glass, and freezing them against the windshield isn't helping,�
Penny chided me gently as she fondled the white bag expectantly, �Then again,
maybe they just don't have enough insulation yet.�


 


����������� And with a
teasing glance, she pulled a few golf ball-sized chocolates from the bag and
tossed them into her mouth.� Even before
she finished swallowing, Penny was growing again.� Her spreading hips blossomed a few inches
broader, pushing me softly but forcefully against the door.� I heard the sound of skin rubbing against
plastic as her belly fattened against the front of the dash, driving Penny's
lush thighs apart to give it growing room.�
Her bosom soaked it up like a sponge, her breasts swelling as they each
gained a good twenty five pounds in as many seconds.� There was a rip as her shirt split open, an
avalanche of mammary flesh spilling outwards, while a second after the engine
roared and the truck slowed as Penny's left thigh pushed the shifter out of
reverse.


 


����������� �Mmm, there
we go, all nice and jiggly,� Penny sighed, patting the side of one distended
breast appreciatively as she looked down at me from her amply-padded seat, �You
know, I think I'm actually starting to get full.� In fact, by the time I go through this whole
bag I may just be positively filled to the brim.� Come on, take me home.�


 


����������� �Sure thing,
hon, just don't have any more of those until we get there,� I cautioned her,
�If you push the shifter any further over we'll be cruising all the way there
at about fifteen miles an hour.�


 


����������� �Okay, I'll
be good,� Penny said with a little pout, looking at me over the tops of her
glasses, �Come on and get moving then so we can have a bit more fun.� By the way, I burst out of my panties while I
was changing into these, so once you get me out of these yoga pants, there'll
be nothing between you and the gates of paradise.� Mmm, they're just so tight I can hardly stand
it.� I bet if I ate just one more of
those chocolates, two of them *tops*, I'll just explode right out of
them.�


 


����������� She winked
at me, biting her lip.� I got the
message; as soon as we reached the main road, I stomped it.


 


����������� And off we
went, me fighting to keep my mind on the road ahead, pinned to the door by my
wife's lavish behind, the bulk of her lusciously milk-heavy bosom pressing soft
and heavy against my arm, every bump and dip in the road transmitted faithfully
through Penny's body as her swollen form wobbled.� She smiled over at me and gave a little
shimmy that set her quivering like a mountain of jello in an earthquake.


 


����������� �Drive a
little faster; I'm eager to get home, and we've got the whole weekend ahead of
us, just you, me, my huge, wet tits, and this little bag of treats,� Penny
breathed, �besides, the road is kind of rough here, and I'm enjoying the
bumps.�
