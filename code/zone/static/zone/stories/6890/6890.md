Day Three. Hunting for food.

	Jill was swiftly realizing that either things were worse than she thought, or she’d drawn a very unlucky stick in the world of post-apocalyptic survival. On the third day in Johnson City after the outbreak, Jill found herself still completely alone, and without stable shelter nor many tools to call her own. All that’d kept the big men, the so-coined studs by the media, away from her for this long was her personal Beretta 9mm handgun, which she’d kept on her person at all times since turning 18. 

	She remembered the day the world fell into chaos, with men turning into hulking, sex-crazed monsters. Children and the elderly had been sort of spared, the virus overwhelming the body of anyone below the age of 20 or so, and any above the age of 70, causing them to enter an odd comatose sort of state. One could only hope that someday a cure is found, society is stabilized, and these people are brought back to the world of the living. On that day, Jill’s husband, the two recently having wed, attacked her, tearing off her shirt before she could get distance between them. She couldn’t bring herself to shoot him directly, even in the state he was, but drawing the gun made him visibly flinch, and then stop advancing. It seemed even in their addled state, the studs knew to fear firearms. Testing one step further, she fired a shot, intentionally missing by a foot or so near his leg. This sent him running in the opposite direction fearfully, and she saw other studs outside fleeing homes and getting as far from the gunfire as possible. She’d probably saved a lot of women that day, and taught many more how they might defend themselves. 

	Unfortunately, she hadn’t managed to meet any, or at least no sane ones. She’d heard telltale feminine moaning coming from some interiors she passed by, no doubt the sounds of women who were already lost to the virus. She’d been moving quickly from place-to-place and hadn’t managed to actually sight any girls at all in all the madness. Just more and more of the studs and their distended, jet-black cocks waiting to seed her. She’d probably need to check buildings for enclaves of women, but she was afraid of enclosed interiors. Any women at this point would likely be a challenge to find unless she caught a scout, which was unlikely. Going into a residential building would be equivalent to throwing her work away and sitting directly on the studs’ waiting dicks. It’d been over 50 hours and she hadn’t found a safe place to sleep, nor much in the way of food or drink, so she’d need to go inside somewhere and scavenge for something

	Jill had already had to fire her gun three times, leaving 12 in the mag, just to clear out thick stud presence in certain areas so she had some breathing room. Unfortunately, she’d noticed studs also tended to come back to the site in greater numbers later, so she couldn’t stay for long. Presumably they were interested since there was evidence of females like herself passing through the area, or something. Regardless, she was becoming reluctant to use it up, conscious that it was the only thing standing between her and them, really. 

	She’d considered going to a Sorority house or something to maybe find some pizza in a fridge safely, but quickly realized a college campus would probably be pretty high-activity, and where there were Sororities, there were Frat houses. Besides, more than one of them probably had boyfriends or other sex-pals around at the time of the outbreak. It’d be foolish. Jill settled for a little gas station she walked by on the edge of town. Miraculously, there wasn’t a stud in sight on this whole street, huge buildings stretching behind her and the long road ahead, petering out into suburbs as it went. She wasn’t ready to abandon the city and its potential resources just yet, but she might be after a quick look inside this establishment. 

	Creaking the door of the inevitable convenience store open, gun held firmly in front of her, pointed towards the ground, Jill explored. After a cursory check of the premises, including stops into the bathrooms, she was satisfied the location was abandoned and breathed a sigh of relief. Maybe she could just set up here? It was certainly a stockpile, seemingly untouched. Probably the only person had been a man behind the counter, who had no use for all the goodies now that he was a stud, probably stumbling out in the city somewhere by now. She smiled for the first time since the outbreak as she bit into a Kit-Kat bar, enjoying the sweet taste and burst of energy. It was all junk, but also wasn’t particularly perishable. Unfortunately, she’d pretty much have to hole up here, since she didn’t have a pack either, and would need one to take an appreciable stockpile of food and supplies with her away from this place. Guess it was a base of operations for now, at least. 

	After a couple frustrating hours of searching around the counters and a back office, she found a hidden key taped to the underside of a drawer she’d had to take out of a desk entirely. Mercifully, the key went to both the front and back doors of the building, and as she locked them shut she got a thrill from the feeling of security she’d missed so much. Maybe she could do the solo-survivor thing just fine. She was a resourceful, strong, intelligent woman and had happened on her first bit of luck in what felt like forever. It was taking a little while, but finally her nerves were dulling with a feeling of rest. She could sleep here, maybe even in that nice office chair, munch on some potato chips or jerky or whatever, maybe there would even be something to read back there. Life was good, for at least a moment. 

	Well, there hadn’t been anything but porn magazines back there, but they’d helped her get to sleep regardless. Letting off some steam felt great and relaxing after all the sexual tension surrounding recent events. She’d managed to avoid making so much as a squeak even through her orgasm, fearing just a bit that she might be heard by some stud outside that would start banging on the doors. Luckily, nothing of the sort happened for the full 10 hours she fell unconscious afterwards, finally getting a proper rest and catching up on some missed sleep, even. Jill sprung into action, being a fairly active morning person, and planned her day during some morning exercises and basic gun care. 

	Highest priority was keeping an eye out for any women, any at all. Even if it was some huge mega-slut, she might be able to talk with her. She’d yet to hear about any women totally losing their minds like the men do. Second priority was securing a backpack and ammo. She was lumping these two together as she’d likely find them in the same place, like a sporting goods store. Third priority was some spare clothing, which she might need in case of close encounters with studs, who seemed particularly eager to rip girls’ clothes off. Final priority was a nice, thick, good-quality vibe and plenty of batteries for it. She had a feeling sexual tension was going to become a big problem in the coming weeks, months, or even years, so may as well embrace it. Might help to have some around for other girls she meets, too, particularly if they’d been fuckin’ the studs. 

	Using a map and a book full of business addresses in the office’s desk, Jill pinpointed a sporting goods store, named Redfield’s Stock-Up. Certainly sounded like the sort of place she might find what she needed, and it was only a couple blocks away. After a breakfast consisting of Little Debbie cinnamon rolls and a can of Red Bull, Jill was off, using the key to exit, and upon some deliberation, left the back door unlocked. Maybe some other girl would happen upon the place needing food and shelter too, and she wanted to maximize the chances of meeting up if so. 

	The streets were quiet today. She spied some studs jacking themselves in alleyways occasionally, but they tended not to care much so long as you kept your distance. She hadn’t had to reroute even once along the way, which she was almost disappointed about after having planned several contingency routes, but supposed it was a good sign for today as well. Here she was, at the entrance to the place without having met virtually any resistance. Hopefully it’d be a quick in-and-out for what she needed, then she could be on her way. 

	She was still wary of enclosed spaces and pointed her gun around the room, eyeing every inch carefully and trying not to announce her presence too obviously. Seeing nothing in the immediate area, she quickly walked over the racks of backpacks and picked out a nice red-and-grey one she liked. The price tag was over $80 so she figured it’d be built to last. Looking around more, she spied the guns and ammo in back, behind the counter. Unfortunately, as expected, it was behind reinforced glass. She didn’t expect she’d be able to shoot it out, and wouldn’t have tried even if she wanted to. Hell, she might’ve ended up letting the ammo cook off and that’d have been a disaster. She also wasn’t keen on potentially setting off an alarm. 

	That was when she heard the moaning. 

	Steeling herself, Jill pinpointed the sound of feminine moans and the slap of flesh-against-flesh, muffled through a nearby doorway. That must be the proper owner’s office, and it sounds like somebody is having a good time back there. Unfortunately, whatever key or lock-releasing mechanism she needs is probably back there. Thinking it over, Jill is overcome with a sense that she’s gonna be a damn heroine and save this lady. They might be able to make headway together, especially if she’s the type to be coming into a sporting goods store, post-apocalyptic or not. 

	Creaking the door open, she saw what she mostly expected, but it was still surprising. There were actually two studs in here. One was laying unconscious on the floor, the other was bent over a naked woman lying atop the desk, bare legs wrapped about his midsection, head thrown back in utter bliss as he pounded into her like a car piston. Neither had noticed her entry into the room, caught up in coitus as they were. Before Jill could decide what to do properly, the moaning reached crescendo and telltale cum leaked from their joined hips, the woman clearly being filled beyond capacity as the stud’s balls emptied their contents inside her womb. She cursed herself for not taking more initiative, but figured late was better than never, and stepped forward. 

	The stud crashed to the ground, unconscious as expected after ejaculating. She’d noticed that studs seemed to have dramatically increased refractory periods compared to even normal men, a key weakness causing them to remain inactive for hours after fucking. Jill approached the naked woman, surprisingly little cum leaking from her vagina at this point, leading Jill to believe it’d been siphoned up by her body somehow. She only reached this conclusion knowing what was about to happen to this woman. While she was still recovering from the orgasmic high, Jill stood over her, gazing at her relatively normal-looking body, particularly the C-cups on her chest, not too dissimilar from Jill’s own. This woman would definitely make a good ally. 

	Mmm More? wavered the woman’s voice, eyes taking time to adjust. Jill looked at her with a perplexed expression, extended a hand to help her stand up. 

	More? More what? asked Jill as the woman got to her feet. She seemed to properly come-to upon hearing Jill’s voice. 

	Oh Oh! You’re a a girl! I thought you were another one of the studs! She hugged Jill in excitement, who got kinda uncomfortable with a naked, sweaty woman up against her like this. With a hint of embarrassment, the woman noticed Jill’s discomfort and backed off, realizing she should find some clothes. My my name is Ash, by the way.

	Jill. Jill responded. Let’s go out into the main area and get you something to wear. I’ll keep watch, and we can talk after. Unfortunately, there wouldn’t be time for that at the moment. A strange look overcome Ash’s face and her eyes closed. 

	Uhh wait a minute, I’m feeling kinda strange kinda good. Ash’s hands flew to her breasts as they tingled hotly. S shit, right! The changes! Jill watched in awe as Ash’s body started rippling. Her once-modest C-cups bulged insistently against her hands, flesh manifesting from seemingly nowhere and being added to her chest. It was just enough extra mass for Jill to call them D-cups now, based on what she remembered from magazine models. Her ass and hips weren’t being left behind, visibly widening and burgeoning outwards. Her hair started to grow dramatically, quickly undoing her ponytail and letting the mass flow uninhibited, and her pubic hair experienced a change too, growing and taking on a consistency not dissimilar from the brown hair on her head, which Jill found strange. As the changes concluded, Ash moaned loudly and visibly orgasmed, her pussy contracting and producing lubricant it hadn’t before, making her inner thighs wet with girl-cum. 

	F fuck. Said Ash, coming down from the experience. That’s gotta be my, what, fifth one in about fifteen minutes? Talk about overwhelming she gazed at her chest, not seeming to know what to think about it, then looked up to Jill, suddenly embarrassed. They both could clearly smell Ash’s pussy scent, it having grown much stronger with the changes as well. Jill gave an understanding nod and showed her the door, which she exited through quickly. Jill looked back over the studs, content they weren’t going to be a threat for now, and then went through the door as well, closing it behind them. 

	Ash managed to find plenty of camo gear to wear, lots of orange hunting stuff too, all of which she managed to cobble together an outfit from. Unfortunately there wasn’t any underwear. 

	Hey uh, Jill? I found something to wear but, do you have any spare underwear, by any chance? asked Ash. 

	Uhh, sorry, I don’t. Guess you wouldn’t be able to find something like that here, huh. You can live without it for now, right? replied Jill. 

	Well, sorta. Ash was shifted around and seemed like she was having trouble saying something. You see, uh, after the changes, I’m really wet now 

	Oh! Oh, yeah, that. Shit. I guess you’ll just have to do your best to manage for now. I don’t really know what to say, sorry Ash. 

	It’s okay, it’s okay, I know it’s kinda awkward Jill wanted to cheer the girl up after letting her embarrass herself so much since they’d met. 

	Hey I’ve got a place, actually, and a gun. We can set up there and have a safe space, doesn’t that sound good? Ash immediately perked up.

	Oooh, a gun? Lemme see!

	The pair quickly bonded over a love of firearms. Jill was happy to have found not only an ally, but a friend as they talked about their favorite guns, custom mods, range practices, and all manner of other things. It turns out, Ash was the Redfield and owner of the store, and she unlocked the guns and ammo cabinets for them, taking a custom M1911 out of a safe for herself with the associated .45 rounds, and stuffing all the ammo they could carry into packs before setting out. 

	Jill was so happy to have found a girl almost just like her. Pretty much the same body shape, similar interests and attitudes even if Ash was a bit more girlish, both were even brunettes. She wished they’d met as kids. Eventually, as they got back to Jill’s place and locked the place up, conversation turned towards their meeting. 

	So, I guess you wanted some sporting goods? asked Ash. 

Yeah, yeah. I figured a backpack would be useful to have, and wanted to have some extra ammo just in case. You know the studs are properly like, afraid of guns and gunfire? Sends them running.

Damn wish I knew that this morning. Ash frowned. I was afraid at first, you know, when they’d found me. I’d come back to my store to grab some things and, well, turns out my employees were still there, now studs, and they cornered me in my office by surprise. Though Ash’s gaze drifted. When it started, it felt really good Ash caught herself about to reach a hand down her pants, which Jill noticed but wrote off. She knew what the virus did, in broad strokes, and was expecting a bit of this from her.

Anyways, uhh, looks like you’ve done well for yourself, managing to avoid them? 

Yeah. Said Jill. I’ve managed to stay away, mostly with the gun trick, and now with this shelter things seem to be smooth sailing. I’m planning on going out almost every day and looking for more girls though. Either we find an enclave or form one of our own eventually, but we need to stick together if we’re gonna make it through this and come out with a functioning society on the other end. Ash nodded her head in agreement. 

The pair chatted the evening away, munching on potato chips and talking about their interests and their plans and their hopes and their fears, before eventually it came time to rest. Ash rolled out a sleeping bag from the sporting goods store in the office, and Jill took up her usual spot in the big comfy chair. At one point, before either had managed to get to sleep, Ash got up and Jill heard the sounds of some doors opening and closing. Was she going into the bathrooms for some reason? Soon, she heard muffled moans and squeaks through the walls, and understood what was going on. She had a girl who’d had her first encounter with studs on board, and was gonna have to deal with that now. It would be an issue more often than not with most girls they found, she rationalized, and this was just the new normal. 

	The next few days were spent on scouting expeditions. The pair of Jill and Ash made a great team, watching one-another’s backs and helping navigate the winding city streets, looking for any signs of feminine habitation. They found nothing, only yet more men with huge erections beckoning for them. Ash had confided in Jill in one night that she still thought of her first encounter sometimes, had even dreamed of it once. Dicks in the field didn’t mess with her too much, but, her body felt sexed-up in ways she couldn’t exactly describe, and she was clearly a plain hornier person now. Jill got the memo, that she’d need to be extra vigilant for Ash’s sake out here. 

	The pair were starting to get worried, that maybe the other women had already been lost to mysterious sex dungeons in the various apartments, or they’d long-since fled the city, by now hundreds of miles away from what was clearly an unsalvageable disaster. These thoughts weighed heavily upon them as they did today’s exploring, this time towards a dense business district in the heart of the city. It’d be dangerous, but they needed to branch out their search more if they were going to find anyone. High-population meant potentially a lot more girls as much as it meant more guys, so they had to find somebody, right? 

	The streets were thick with stud activity, even moreso than Jill had expected. They’d needed to use more than a couple fallback routes and were currently taking an impromptu jaunt through some alleyways to avoid a group that’d rounded a corner and they’d gotten dangerously close to. Luckily, they’d gone by unnoticed and managed to sneak into their current location for a breather. It was surprisingly well-kept for an alleyway, looked like the kind of place children of upscale families had probably played a lot before the outbreak, judging by the various sports paraphernalia and chalk drawings. 

	The heard a door swing open behind them. 

	Whirling about, weapons drawn, the two women spied one of the studs stumbling out of a doorway. He must’ve been one of the original residents and was coming out to get something to eat, or perhaps looking for girls such as them. This wasn’t an uncommon predicament, they’d spent plenty of rounds scaring studs off over the past several days, but this situation was a little different. With stud activity this high, would the resulting chaos truly be advantageous for them? Jill glanced at Ash and was sure they were both thinking the same thing, but had no choice as the stud lunged at them despite having guns pointed in his direction. Their guns rang loudly, the dry crack echoing against the enormous buildings surrounding them. 

	They heard a harrowing groaning as likely thousands of studs stirred into activity. 

	Fuck! said Jill and Ash in unison. 

	Come on, this way! Jill grabbed Ash by the hand, pulling her out of the alley before it filled up. They were just in time, as doors everywhere slammed open and various studs filtered out. Sure, lots of them were heading away, but the large proportion indoors would need to exit those interiors to get an appreciable distance away, and in so doing might cross paths with the girls. They made their way towards one of the big office buildings, being their initial target to search around. It didn’t seem to have any studs coming out of it at the moment, and probably had plenty of places to hide while this whole situation blew over, Jill rationalized. 

	They stormed up a few stairs and started opening doors, looking for closets or something. Luckily hadn’t seen any studs yet in the spacious offices, though cubicles might be hiding anything. Jill opened one door frantically, and found herself face-to-face, or rather face-to-chest, with one of the studs.

	Looks like my luck’s running out

	Jill was a tall girl, taking pride in how she was taller even than many boys at her full six feet, but that wasn’t the case anymore. Studs were huge, at minimum about seven feet tall, and this specimen was perhaps half a foot taller than that. His rippling musculature was intimidating to say the least, particularly well-within arm’s reach like this. Before Jill knew it, one of his hands had grasped her simple T-shirt, tearing it off with ease. She used this opportunity to create distance between her and the stud, modesty retained by her bra and pants of course. She looked around for Ash, wondering why she wasn’t helping, and was surprised to see another two studs. Ash was facing them down, but didn’t seem to want to fire again, and Jill couldn’t blame her. Things were getting out of hand. Another setback befell Jill as it turned out the initial stud was quicker than expected, grabbing her gun-arm this time and forcing her to drop the weapon. She couldn’t fight against his insane, mutated strength in a significant-enough way despite probably being stronger than more than half of men before the outbreak, and he used his other hand to reach for her remaining clothing. First her bra, then her pants and panties all in one go, she was exposed before the hulking masculine figure. 

	Ash looked over with surprise and fear as Jill was swiftly overcome, and in her indecision, she was beset by the two studs in front of her. The pair made short work of her clothes, particularly with the continued lack of underwear, and she was relieved of her firearm, leaving the pair with just two pairs of tennis shoes between them for clothes. 

	Jill felt some fear, but was also surprisingly calm given the circumstances. Her mind recalled the state she’d found Ash, the friendship they’d formed, her accounts of that stud encounter Jill would probably be okay still, after this one. She was more just disappointed at her own carelessness. The stud turned her around and pushed her to her knees. She had a moment of fight in her, scrambling forwards, but was easily caught by her feet and yanked back into position. The stud also seemed to notice her shoes as clothes and pulled them off while he was at it, leaving her cold and bare in the sterile office. Caught now at the ankles, she looked over her shoulder and her lips parted a bit in surprise at the stud’s massive member, the huge, black horsecock rising with arousal. That was going inside her? It was definitely going to be a tight fit, though she couldn’t deny a hint of thrill. She’d always been a bit of a size queen, that’s why her husband had had eleven inches. 

	This was much larger than she’d ever experienced though, even more than that huge guy at the frat party in college. Her pussy was positively filled by the stud’s girth as he shoved it all in with one stroke, making Jill moan unabashedly in the same moment his grapefruit-sized balls slapped against her thighs. She realized now she was in full view of what was going on with Ash. She was getting railed doggystyle in much the same way, and if anything seemed to be getting even more out of it than Jill. She guessed that’s just what the changes did to you. The third stud, curiously, stood by, merely stroking his cock without acting on either of the girls.

The stud behind her started moving, pulling his length out of her twitching canal and then slamming it right back in with long, smooth movements. It was like having your pussy shaped, like it was turning to putty or clay and being molded into the shape of this stud’s penis, growing better at receiving it even as he picked up the pace. Jill had never felt so much sheer pressure in all her sexual encounters. There was such an intense feeling of fulfillment from inside that she’d never gotten before with any of her previous paramours. She found herself moaning, mouth hanging open and even drooling a bit. She must look like a total slut right now, almost as much as Ash looked. She started using her arms and hips to move her body, meeting the stud’s thrusts and enhancing their speed and intensity. Her nipples tingled hotly and she reached up to tweak one, and in that moment came for the first time in almost a week. Her orgasming pussy’s rapid contractions seemed to please the stud, and he picked up the pace even more, moving at what looked like an almost impossible speed. She quickly came a second time, and then a third, before she felt his prick widen even more inside her. He was close. 

The stud grunted as his balls audibly churned and burbled, cum welling its way up through his thick pipe and jetting inside Jill’s body. She was amazed at the sheer quantity, and the heat, feeling it drip along her thighs as it overflowed and gushed through the near-airtight seal where their bodies met. Her virus was activated now, she thought, as the stud’s meaty pole pumped out rope after rope of viral semen. After ten, or twelve, or however many, he was finished. She felt his cock already softening as he slumped backwards, pulling his dick out and leaving her feeling sort of empty. She shuddered with sensation, feeling cum dripping between her thighs, holding her ass up in the air. Unfortunately for her, the spare stud in the room was still there, and she looked like an awfully appealing target right now. 

Jill gasped in surprise as she was suddenly penetrated again, not even noticing the stud’s approach in her post-sexual haze. 

A.. again?! Can I handle another one? I guess Ash did

This one was just as perfect a specimen as the last, his powerful body and cock pushing into her feminine folds with wild abandon. A strange sensation befell her in the midst of this second penetration, almost removing her from the experience with a zen-like calm. She felt attuned with her body, particularly her sexual attributes, and then felt them, in some way, take up more space in her mind, like they were more apparent. She felt her chest tingling, and then soon enough it swung just that slight bit more heavily beneath her. Her butt felt a bit more plush as the stud’s hips impacted it repeatedly. Most of all, she felt and heard wetness as her vagina lubed itself, which it had never done before even while she was extremely aroused. Guess she was a wet girl, now. 

Coming back to reality, Jill noted the stud’s girth still felt divine, plowing her wide open, making her feel like a total slut as she couldn’t deny how pleased this was making her feel. It was such a size that, while not too big to fit, she didn’t think it’d ever be possible to get properly used to it, like it’d always be surprising and exciting to get plowed by these cocks over and over

She’d get to put that thought to the test, it turns out. She noticed four new studs standing about the area. When had they arrived? They had to have been attracted by their rampant girly moans or something. Her pussy started contracting involuntarily and getting even wetter at the sight of their cocks, which were steadily rising with arousal. Even more big, black horsemeat for her body to play with soon. She couldn’t tell anymore if she was upset or thrilled. 

Ash’s stud finally finished inside her, and she was unceremoniously handed off to another stud, this time lifted up and dropped onto his dick, kicking her shoes off and wrapping her legs around his waist. Jill could see that Ash was properly smiling at this turn of events, and her body had grown curvier once again. Soon that would be Jill herself, too, she thought as the stud inside her blasted her womb with yet more of the studs’ transformative cocktail. As the next stud flipped her and put her back on a desk, railing into her without a moment of foreplay, she felt that sensation wash over her again. Her assets swelled, becoming similar to Ash’s, her hair grew voluminously, both on her head and between her thighs, and her vagina lubed up even more. Additionally, her cunt felt almost elastic. Any discomfort from before was eliminated, but none of that delicious pressure and friction seemed to go away. She was getting better at taking their cocks. This one was bigger than the last two, so she appreciated the enhancement, moaning yet more as he penetrated her depths oh-so effectively. 

Her cunt was so pliant now, yielding around the stud’s every movement, rippling wildly as it contracted to squeeze and please his meat from every conceivable angle. It was like its own force of nature, trying to extract more fluids and continue to improve itself so it could do the same thing over and over, better than before, faster than before, hotter than before. The stud lasted however, not cumming any faster than the last ones, which Jill was fine with all the same. That meant experiencing more of that delicious friction, more of that fulfilling sensation of having cock lodged firmly in her depths, stroking every sensitive nerve at a fever pitch. 

She swung her head back and gave a low howl of pleasure as this third stud ejaculated inside her. She was already stuffed so full of cum, he seemed to give up trying to put more into her halfway through and pulled out, spraying rope after rope of thick, goopy semen across her body. She found herself appreciating the warmth in some debauched way, with how cold and sterile this room was by comparison. She watched his cum-tube dilate head on with the powerful ejaculations, every part of the stud’s body working as hard as possible to deliver as much semen as possible to her. Even just half of his full orgasm was enough to make her body drip with the stuff, runnels from her face dripping to her cleavage, down between her thighs. She watched her cum-soaked chest heave in the aftermath, and beyond, a fourth stud ready to fuck. He seemed to be the last, Ash having burned through the others. What was that, like four for her and three for Ash? 

Changes were washing over her again as this last stud pumped her seemingly-tireless cunt for all it was worth. Her titties bulged and fattened, rounding out into a gravity-defying shape. She felt her ass bubbling and cushioning even more beneath her, even as her hip bones groaned, visibly widening, thighs thickening alongside. She’d been pretty before, but was gonna look like a classy pornstar by the end of all this, she imagined. Something else was happening too, thoughts of cocks worming their way into her mind. Obviously she was thinking about them a lot at the moment, being four dicks deep into a veritable orgy, but their perfect, gleaming horsemeat seemed to take up residence in her brain. A part of her that wasn’t used before now felt dedicated to thinking of dicks. And balls, their heavy cum-packed balls were hot as hell too. Her pussy practically sang with delight as it got its fourth cock of the day. Jill almost felt spoiled. The insides of her thighs were painted almost entirely white, cum spattering as the stud mindlessly ground his hips into hers. She held her legs wide, grabbing them at the ankles so he’d be able to plow her as easily as possible, curling her toes in a display of absolute pleasure, cooing with delight. She found herself adopting that pleasant smile Ash had worn. 

Somewhere in all this, her cunt had emptied of stud-cum. How this happened was beyond her understanding, but she had an instinctive feeling that it’d all been absorbed by her inner walls. She looked past her newly-enlarged breasts, still at least able to see her crotch, mesmerized by the sight of her pussy being pounded so relentlessly by so much penis. She only wished she could see his heavy masculine orbs more clearly, fantasizing about the payload they bore just for her. Maybe next time, she could please them with another part of her body, like her face

The stud ejaculated without warning, pumping her full of creamy white batter once again. This time she definitely felt her cunt sucking all of it up, more evident now that it was doing so much faster. She could even feel how it was fulfilling her... nutritionally? She didn’t feel like she needed to eat or even drink, at this point, despite the hefty workout she was going through. Mercifully, the last stud fell with a thud full of finality. 

Hazily, Jill looked around, seeing a sweat-covered Ash sitting in chair, marveling at her tits. There didn’t seem to be anymore studs, and with that realization, Jill’s breathing slowed down, finally able to rest for a moment after all that excitement. Ash’s eyes locked with Jill’s when she realized they’d both come to. 

They were changed now. Things were going to be a lot different. They’d need to talk about it later though. Needed to find a way home first. 

Before even that however, the pair had one last batch of changes to run through, from their final studs. The girls moaned in unison, surprised they were even able to still do so with how much they’d done already. Their tits swelled, broaching DD-cup size, looking even bigger than they were because of how highly they sit on their chests, rounding out like hemispheres, thick nipples pointing insistently. The other changes manifested soon after, including that last curious one. Cock made itself apparent in their minds once again, even if only for a brief moment, holding their attentions before letting go. 

Jill stood, feeling slightly self-conscious due to her nudity, but desiring to test her balance with her new assets. Surprisingly, her body seemed already acclimated to the changes, even allowing her to stand on one foot as usual. Satisfied with the results, the two nodded to each other, retrieved their guns, and set out quickly before more studs arrived. They were operating mostly on autopilot, still with the presence of mind to ignore what happened. They’d process that when they got back home. In a daze, they wound their way through city streets, which were thankfully much clearer at the least, after the sounds of gunfire. One small blessing. They hadn’t managed to find any women, or anything of value really other than a lot of stud semen, but regardless their lives were very likely to be more interesting from here-on-out. 

	We’re total sluts. Ash cleared the air very directly when they sat down to talk, safely locked down at night in their convenience store. 

	Not total sluts well, sort of. Jill’s belief in her statement faltered as her mind turned to dicks. Was she really still hungry for them? Sure enough, her bared pussy was juicing itself up openly. They didn’t have clothes anymore for either of them, so Ash could see her arousal plainly.

	See? Sluts. I can’t believe we thought we could do this, or anything, out here 

	Hey now, don’t beat yourself up. We’re not sluts, just like, human, you know? It’s a walking wet-dream for someone like me out there, and you know me, I’m a serious kind of girl. She puffed out her chest, which really just had the effect of making her look down-to-fuck moreso than making her look tough with those big tits, but her point was made.

	You’re right, I shouldn’t be so hard on myself. It’ll only make things difficult. More difficult, that is. She said the last while hefting one of her new boobs, seeming amazed by their size and weight. 

	I’m glad it’s just us two, I’d probably die of embarrassment if we had a whole society of girls seeing the two of us totally naked like this. She ruminated. 

	Haha, what’s there to be embarrassed about? We’re knockouts! Jill countered. Ash figured she had a point. They could draw confidence from this development, and that was healthier than being miserable about being so fuckable. 

	Thanks, Jill. Your support means a lot. I think we’re gonna make it through this.

	Well, don’t thank me too much. As much as I believe what I said, we’re gonna want some vibrators if we’re gonna avoid going stir-crazy in here. Their pussies were clearly ready for another round, with both of them nude and talking about sex stuff and their bodies, it was inevitable really. The feminine smell of pussy-juices permeated the room. 

	Still, the two shared a laugh, knowing the apocalypse really wasn’t as scary as they’d made it out to be in their minds. So maybe you pick up a few fetishes, get really sexy, engage in some sexual shenanigans. Not like they tried avoiding that stuff before. The new world was really what they made of it, and they wouldn’t have it any other way.

More of a one-shot experiment. May or may not return to these two if I can think of further explorations for their characters, but really, nothing is planned and they aren’t set up as in-depth characters for a longer format. 

I hope to do more of these in the future too, since I’m itching to explore all kinds of personalities in this setting and it doesn’t always make sense to dump tons of new characters on the main storyline.
