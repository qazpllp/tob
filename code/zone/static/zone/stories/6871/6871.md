Chapter 3: Cycles 

When Julia staggered back into the communal quarters, her breasts still dribbling isolated drops 
of opaque white on the clean cucumber floor, the tenders to either side of her were practically carrying 
her. They deposited her in the showers against a wall, and hit a button as they departed to bring down a 
torrent of warm water on the twitching exhausted woman. 

The water trickling over her bare flesh was welcome. Long hours’ worth of sweat and other 

grime clung to her body. But also at an inchoate psychological level Julia felt horribly dirty and in need of 
being cleansed. Warm rivulets comforted her abused flesh, matting her hair down and dripping off the 
ends of her still half-erect nipples. Around her scores of other women were also showering. Most, unlike 
her, had shed their remaining clothing at the door. Julia took no notice of them for a long while. She 
simply stood under the comforting flow barely moving her eyes closed. 

Julia only made her way out of the showers, by now almost deserted, because the water flowing 

over her shut off of its own accord. Dripping, she wandered out into the assembly room. The housing 
pod was laid out in a clover-leaf arrangement: the assembly room was a central hub, behind it was the 
showers while the bunk room and the mess hall lay to either side.  

The bunk room was dim and quiet, and to judge by the noise most of the women were in the 
opposite chamber. Julia turned in that direction. Within she was met with a bustle of activity. Rows of 
tables and benches akin to those in a school cafeteria were occupied by over a hundred women taking a 
meal. Voices came from all quarters. Julia felt somewhat bewildered and paused on the threshold taking 
in the scene. Her soaked underwear clung to her more-or-less transparently. (The fact that this barely 
solicited a second glance says much about the place.) 

She was plucked from her stupor by Jacky, who walked up beside her and put a hand on her 

shoulder. “There you are. I looked for you. Come sit down.” 

Julia gratefully followed leaving a trail of wet footprints on the wooden floor. Jacky made her 
way to an end table where Torch and several women Julia didn’t know already sat, Jacky gestured for 
her to sit and she slid in beside Torch who was eating hungrily. 
“Ugh,” Torch grunted, looking up, “you didn’t dry off.” 
Julia shook her head dejectedly. “No,” she agreed. 
“There are blowers to the left of the door.” Torch said. “Feels good too.” She scooted a few 

inches further from her sopping bench mate. 

Jacky pushed a few pieces of the stuff Torch was eating towards Julia. “You might want to eat 

something, honey.” The substance offered looked like bars of grey-brown modeling clay.  

“What is it?”  
“We don’t know,” Jacky admitted. “It comes out of the dispenser kiosks over there just like this. 

I’ve heard 

 call it ‘fill’.” 
them
​

Julia exhibited exactly no desire to put a stick of fill into her mouth. 

​
​
“It’s sort of like really dense tofu. It’s not gross or anything. Anyhow, it’s all we have to eat.” 
Julia still let the solid-looking sticks remain on the table in front of her. 
“How was your first day?” 
“It was horrible,” Julia whimpered. 
Jacky frowned sympathetically.  
“What did they have you doing?” Torch inquired. 
Julia didn’t speak for a minute. Then her words all tumbled out at once, “They put me up on a 

wall and milked me like a cow,” she wailed. “They’d just walk up and grope me! And then they’d sit 
there and drink the milk like it was normal!” 

“Yea,” Jacky said softly. “The first day is rough. But you made it through.” 
In a disorganized stream the chronicle of the day’s seemingly unending ordeal poured out 
before her audience. After she’d realized what was going on, she’d had nothing to do but watch in dread 
as each new customer entered and selected some poor woman’s rack to manhandle knowing that her 
own turn must soon come. Before long it had. A balding man in a drab tie selected her and, placing his 
flagon down beneath her dangling breasts, proceeded to milk first right then left. At his first 
unceremonious yank she’d let out a small shriek. The feeling of her tender flesh being thus grabbed and 
of milk spurting out of her were both deeply jarring. She intuited, perhaps from the silent endurance of 
most of the other woman, that she must keep quiet, so she tried to stifle the involuntary urge to cry out. 
But a string of whimpers and mewls had escaped her nonetheless as the man’s grip tugged the liquid out 
of her. 

After what seemed eons he’d finished and strolled away sipping his drink. But her outbursts had 

drawn looks and pointing from all quarters of the room. A small line formed in place of her single 
tormentor. For perhaps an hour subsequent there wasn’t a single break in her ordeal as one pair of 
hands followed the other in assaulting her swollen glands until she hung exhausted from vain struggling 
and inexorable stimulation. 

The balding man’s attentions had, for its short duration, seemed like the depth of misery. But 
she soon discovered that his conduct was are from the worse for her. Some hands pinched and tugged 
at her by now very erect nipples. Others grasped her bosom without technique, clumsily kneading great 
handfuls of her undefended flesh and extracting only a few dribbles of milk. At times both of her breasts 
were clasped by a different set of eager digits. 

She was humiliated beyond all description. Many of the men scarcely glanced at her face as if 
she were simply part of the bar equipment. But those whose gaze took all of her in would often make 
eye contact as they placidly filled their glasses and that was even worse. Further deepening the burning 
humiliation of this ordeal, there was an element of pleasure intimately mingled with the discomfort, 
alarm, and frustration. A hum of arousal which she did her best not to countenance soon crept into the 
background of her experience and never really went away. She kicked her concealed legs impotently in 
frustration. Even when nobody was mauling her, her nipples stood erect and proud, dribbling their 
contents onto the shelf bellow.  

Every other woman shared essentially the same tribulation, and witnessing their degradation 

seemed to reflect her own back to her. Though even in the midst of things she’s several times been 
stabbed by a pang of sympathy for one of the others. The redhead who had served the day’s first 
customers had at one point become the focus of a pack of teenagers who’d entered together. While the 
staff was otherwise occupied, they formed a semi-circle and pushed one of their number forward. He 
was red faced and hesitant at first, but bolstered by his fellows he reached up and drew one tender pink 
nipples into his mouth.  The woman’s face was a picture of misery as this eighteen-year-old warmed to 

his activity and showed off for his audience, his adolescent maw suckling first one bosom and then the 
other. She bucked furiously, but this only served to send some of her fiery curls into her eyes where she 
was powerless to remove them. Her tormentor tossed and blew. As her ordeal continued her face 
deepened in hue and she began audibly whimpering, but it was still some time before an aproned staff 
member barked at the kids. As the teenagers scattered guffawing the barman came over and wiped 
down the ends of the mistreated breasts.  

And that there was pitiful Maryanne. When someone had finally set hands to her swollen torso 

the milk had gushed out in a geyserous discharge which sprayed all over the shelf and struck the man 
milking her. She’d let out a long shivering moan of comingled relief and misery. The man seemed 
amused by the spectacle and began pumping at the bursting mounds with gusto. From that point on, 
even when no pressure was being applied to her, milk simply flowed from Maryanne’s conical chest. The 
bar tenders returned at intervals to clean up the mess. Given what Julia was feeling, she had no desire to 
imagine what the girl next to her was going through. At times Maryanne sounded genuinely grateful 
when a pair of hands clasped her leaking bust. 

“And my

my swelled 

…

 now,” Julia concluded miserably. “They’re producing milk! 
even bigger
​

They turned me into a dairy cow!” She buried her head in her arms.

Lieutenant Kirs  scanned passing members of the crowd with an expert eye. If asked, he’d have

had difficulty explaining what exactly he was looking for. When one has become good at spotting 
something very subtle it is often nearly impossible to explain what alerts one to its presence. One simply 
sees it. That was true here. It was something about the cast of a man’s eyes, thought Kirs, something in 
the way they moved and focused. But that was surely just part of it. It was hard to put one’s finger on.  
There were those who didn’t even bother trying to spot good candidates and just administered 
the test to as many as possible, pulling men off the street at random, stopping whatever passerby was 
interested with the offer of tokens. But the success rates were abysmally low. Out of the thousands of 
men who swarmed through the open sectors of the City each cycle only a tiny minority had any prospect 
of passing the test, much less the subsequent screening. And one could see at a glance that many were 
too absorbed in the enticements all around them to even heed the little oddity they’d be handed. Why 
waste so much time watching people vainly fiddle with the thing? Better to administer the test only 
where there was some hope of success. 

The test itself was an ingenious piece of design on the part of the Shaperate, a spherical puzzle 
to which some would intuit a solution rapidly while others would experience an impenetrable enigma. 
These latter would manipulate its rings for a few moments and then toss the thing away as no path 
forward presented itself. Insight into the puzzle’s obscure architecture directly correlated with a specific 
sort of alertness and conceptual power. In essence the puzzle could be used as a litmus test for the 
aptitude which might fit a dreamer for a position in the City.  

Kirs and a handful of others were responsible for providing most of the men to entered the 
ranks of the city’s various divisions. The need was constant, but generally small. Once induced into 
citizenship, men tended to remain long-term. And finding new citizens was far less pressing than slaking 
the constant thirst for female “visitors.” That was the reason the latter was an edifice unto itself while 
the former was the purview of a few officers amongst the tenders. 

1 Pronounced “kɪərz” and most definitely not, as was the irritating tendency of some who had only seen it written, 
like a nickname for a Kirsten. 

​
Of course, it took virtually no effort at all to bring in the throngs of men who coursed through 
the City’s open sectors each cycle. But most of the urge-producing masses had a consciousness of the 
world around them that, while entirely sufficient for their enjoyment of what the city had to offer, 
lacked the lucidity required by tender and archon alike. It wasn’t that those who failed the test were 
stupid—it was simply that their consciousness wasn’t where it needed to be. 

Today Kirs had chosen open sector Rho-3. Rho was one of the sectors laid out for foot traffic in 
mimicry of an urban area, and he’d chosen a place in it where the throng tended to be thinner and less 
knockabout. He had selected a corner in the section nicknamed “bar end” a block of amusements that 
were all variations on the common bar theme. There was 
though much heightened, breastaurant setting; 
catered to fantasies of frauleins bearing steins; 
classic Playboy; 
from udders. Kirs watched the patrons come and go from the embellished facades and wondered, as he 
had before, if certain amusements were more likely than others to draw the particular sort of man he

looked for.

 “Excuse me, sir. Would you like a few coins?” He stopped a bright-eyed young man in a 

Manchester United jersey who looked as if he hadn’t shaved for a few days. 

The man stepped away from the cluster he was walking with, “What’s that?” He queried with a 

slight Irish accent. 

“Two coins to try solving this puzzle, and ten more if you do it.” Kirs offered. It seemed a little 

odd to entice with trivial sums rather than leading with, “Take this test and you could become one of the 
men that run this place.” But a key tenant of the open sectors’ management was that, to the greatest 
extent possible, operational infrastructure would be obscured. For the visitors the delights of the city 
just unfolded in a way that made perfect sense to dream logic. It was best that they should focus on the 
cake and not be distracted by its chef or his ingredients. 

“Sure. I’d take twelve bob.” He winked and held his hand out for the puzzle, then beckoned with 

the other for this two coins. 

Pocketing the coins he stared at the sphere intently for a minute, spun a ring tentatively, then 

stared again before spinning another. After a long minute he grinned. “Ah, that’s cute! The center spins 
on its own when you look thus.” An instant later the top of the puzzle sprung open with a “sprong!” 

“Indeed it does,” replied Kirs, smiling in turn. “What’s your name? I might know of some more 

“I’m Collin.” The young man responded, “And you’re not tryin’ to welch on my fackin’ coins, are 

opportunities for a gifted fellow like you.” 

you, mate?” He held out his palm.

Jacky did her best to comfort the new girl, though it was hard to know exactly what to say to 
her. She’d gotten through her first day without being driven to anything that earned demerits. That 
alone was a fortunate sign: it seemed like new women were especially likely to do something stupid in 
their first few days. Probably that was by design. They’d add to the impact of landing in the City the 
immediate punitive reassignment or two. Avoiding that was good. 

2 In the euphemisms of the City a recruited female is a “guest” while a visiting male is a “patron” or a “visitor”.

​
From Jacky’s point of view Julia’s ordeal simply didn’t seem so dire. There was a time when it 

would have seemed so, but that time was beginning to feel far off. Jacky had been in the City a long 
while. She had been there for more cycles than anybody else in her housing pod. And in that time her 
perspective had developed. How could it not? Yes, being serially fondled in light bondage was still 
unpleasant, but it was far from the worst fate one could find oneself enduring.  

Still she offered Julia a sympathetic ear and tried to raise her spirits. She felt some obligation to 

try and take care of the new ones, to ease their transition a bit. The other girls Julia had seen at the 
table, Torch aside, were also fairly recent arrivals, though they’d been imprisoned for some cycles 
already. Regardless of whether you had the worst of it, this place was no vacation, Jacky reminded 
herself. And there was no way to really make them see things her way. “Just remind yourself that it’s a 
dream, and you’ll wake up eventually,” she was just now saying for the benefit of her protégés. 

“A dream?” queried Julia, apparently puzzled. 
“This.” Jacky gestured around the room, “this whole thing, is a dream.” Had the young woman 

been so muddled she’d missed that? 

 what does that mean? This is my dream?” 

Julia shook her head. “But
“Not yours, I don’t think. But somebody’s dream that you’re having. Point is, it isn’t really real.” 
“But how is that possible?” 
“I don’t know. But it is a dream. They told you in your orientation. And think about it, you must 

…

have kind of known: you’re upset right now. But if you’d really been enslaved, surgically altered, and 
then molested by a bunch of guys wouldn’t you be 

 upset?”

​

Julia was very quiet for a while. “So none of this is real? It feels real.” 
“Well dreams do feel real when you’re in ‘em.” Torch offered irritably. 
“So

so I’ll wake up sometime soon and then all of this will go away?” Julia’s face brightened at 

this prospect for the first time. 

…

“No, honey, I wish.” Jacky replied ruefully. “You’ve already woken up once and you’re still here.” 
“What do you mean? I don’t remember waking up?” Just as the grotesqueness of the last few 
days had begun to form itself into something she could wrap her mind around it collapsed back into a 
confused heap. 

“You know when you were out cold after being changed, processed?” 
Julia nodded. 
“You were probably awake in there. You had a normal day, fed your cat, went back to bed, and 

…

but I don’t remember any of that.” 

then woke up here.” 
“But
“No, and you won’t. They do some trick on your memory so that what you remember of being 
here and memories of being awake are kept separate.” Every once in a while a stray memory did seem 
to get through though without rhyme or reason. Some cycles prior Jacky had suddenly had a vivid 
mental image of herself eating a Romaine salad. Nothing else. Just a flash of shoveling leaves into her 
mouth with a salad fork. No context, no memory of when it had happened. “If it happens after you came 
here then you won’t remember it.” 

“I mean think: thousands of women end up here, don’t you think some of them would post 

about it on the internet or something? Maybe try to find the people that did this to them?”  

When they’d first brought Jacky in she’d had a somewhat different introduction to the city from 

most other women, likely because of how she’d been snared. They brought her into a posh looking 
conference room and matter-of-factly explaining to her in careful detail about her long outstanding 

​
debt, and exactly how the collateral was finally being collected. As they’d done it, they’d stripped her 
bare and then forced her to do a jumping jacks.  

Trembling with rage she’d promised that the instant she woke up she’d find every last one of 

them, and their friends, and light them on fire. She knew where the paper trail started. And she would 
tell everyone. They’d simply laughed. “No, you won’t,” one said, “you’ll never be motivated to 
investigate.” Then they’d explained the “memory lock” that rendered her shouted threats impotent. 
“We could,” one concluded as a final dagger twist, “each write our names and contact information on 
your naked body right now and still never hear anything further about it.” He made a writing motion 
with his finger pointing at her belly. 

“It’s like there are two of you living two lives.” A new voice offered quietly. It was Angelique, a 
skinny, ivory-skinned woman who had been a graduate student of some kind. “One of you is living your 
free life up in the real world, and one of you is locked down here. And the two can’t really talk to each 
other.” 

“So it’s not real, but it seems real and there’s no way out.” Julia hazarded. 
“Exactly,” said Torch. “It sucks ass.” 
“You will get out eventually, when your visit is over,” Jacky corrected wistfully. 
 

●  ●  ● 
 

Though it was almost impossible not to refer to them as ‘days’ there were no true days in the 

City. One of the few furnishings the women in a housing pod were permitted were clocks built into the 
walls of each room. These clocks had a single hand and were not divided into twelve hours. Instead, they 
looked more like a pie chart, mostly red with a black wedge at the top. This face represented a cycle. 
When the hand came out of the black section, Julia and the other women woke to begin their day. When 
the needle was crossing back into the black she must be in her bunk at night. The time in between was 
subdivided into a long portion for work and a small one in which the women were locked inside their 
pod. This was the pattern of every cycle: wake, labor, return, have a shower and a meal followed by 
3
occupying themselves for a while before re-entering the bunk.  

Have you noticed how you can have a rather elaborate dream in a few minutes of dozing? Or 
how time seems to slow to a crawl when something is going horribly wrong? Subjective time is not as 
closely tethered to objective time as we sometimes suppose, and the builders of the city made 
systematic use of this fact. Subjectively, the part of a cycle the women were conscious for lasted about 9 
hours. Objectively these 540 minutes of activity had been compressed into far fewer actual minutes. 

As Julia sat with her new companions the present cycle was drawing to a close. Presently 

someone would point out that they should get into their bunks. Julia would find this a good deal more 
awkward than the night before due to being fully alert this time. True, lying prone with her udders 
dangling beneath her caused less discomfort than lying either on top of them or below them, but it also 
made her feel like an obscene piñata. Yet this aversion would make no difference. At a certain point 
everybody in the bunk room would pass from consciousness to unconsciousness as rapidly as they had 
4
done the opposite at the cycle’s start.  

3 The clocks a shaper would have looked at was rather more elaborate, as was the daily routine. But the women in 
the pod lacked occasion to observe this. 
4 Women who weren’t in bed by the proper time could only keep their eyes open for a short while. If they were 
unable or disinclined to sprint to a bunk then they would collapse where they stood and possibly wake to fresh 
demerits. 

 
●  ●  ● 
 

So the wheel began to turn for Julia. She’d be trundled off to the 

 each morning, 
Generous Cow
​

where she’d endure a day of indignity. Each night she’d be locked back in the confines of her pod, a 
world only four rooms large. 

Her shock at all this began to fade, but her intense loathing did not. Her hours on the wall felt 
endless, even more so because once the initial shock had receded a certain tedium became a defining 
feature of her experience. This only served to make the involuntary stimulation of her bosom more 
salient, but also left her grasping at anything else that could hold her attention. Her mount severely 
restricted what she could see, but In due course she had minutely studied everyone and everything in 
that field of vision. She knew the major knots in the woodgrain of nearby tables. She began to notice 
patterns in the sea of male faces: some of the other ladies had regular fondlers, bar regulars who 
seemed to prefer a particular pair of tits to any others. It did not take long to acquire some of her own. It 
was a compliment she would have done much not to receive. She learned each face, each pair of 
nipples, and how the expression on that face would change when those nipples were squeezed. Her 
fellow “cows” were quite varied in appearance and shape, notwithstanding that all bore monstrous 
breasts.  

Maryanne calmed somewhat as their disastrous first encounter--for which Julia whispered 

profuse apology—receded into the past. She would answer questions and exchange what brief syllables 
they could. One morning a dark beauty with the pixy cut and enormous areolae was blindfolded along 
with her morning shot so that every pair of hands that assaulted her that day came as a surprise in the 
dark. Asked about this Maryanne explained that Quinton, the thin man who administered the injections, 
discomfited the immobilized women at whim. “He’s a mean little fuck-head,” she’d whispered, “and if 
you look at him wrong he’ll find a way to make your day more miserable. He might even put you in the 
mirrored box.” An approaching bartender had kept Julia from finding out what the mirrored box was. 
The next day the unfortunate object of Quinton’s whit had a real cowbell dangling from her neck. Her 
every involuntary twitch and quiver produced jangling.  

At the end of the day Julia would be escorted wearily back to her pod, hair matted with sweat, 

nipples tingling from over-stimulation. She’d shower, eat sparingly of the tasteless matter provided, and 
pass some time before bed. It might seem unlikely, but it took her three cycles to realize that there were 
no bathrooms in the pod. Jacky explained that nobody seemed to need them. 

She felt fortunate that Jacky had taken her under her wing. The older woman seemed to know 
the ropes, such as they were, and to take more interest in her than most. Having even just one or two 
friendly faces to seek out at the end of the day made all the difference. In a place like this one made fast 
friends. 

Obviously the others had their own daily ordeals, and she came to know them just as they knew 

hers. Torch, it seemed, was a perpetual contestant in a sort of rough fetish athletic competition. 
Angelique waited tables in an elegant club, her tiny frilled uniform concealing nothing of interest. In 
waking she’d waited tables on and off for years as a way of paying for her humanities degree, and once 
commented pensively that she was, in a sense, less meanly treated here than in waking. “So many 
customers seemed to despise me as a person. Here, I’m naked, but they’re much more polite.” Of 
course, when working for tips at 

 she had sat on fewer laps. 
Perkins
​

Jacky said the least about what occupied her days. She seemed anxious not to dwell on it. By her 

description she was a “dom” but she added very little about what this entailed. She did mention the 

​
​
odium of her outfit though, which apparently included a harsh corset and thigh-high boots with 
preposterous heels. 

None in the small circle had been visibly reshaped to the extent Julia had, though they had all 

been altered. The curves of Jacky’s olive-skinned figure had been accentuated strikingly, though not 
beyond plausibility. Torch found herself more resistant to pain than it had been, her voice changed, and 
her haunches widened. “And my name,” she added, “I wasn’t born ‘Torch’.” 

Julia was startled. Everybody, including Torch herself, used the name. Why employ it here if it 

was something they’d forced on her? “What’s your real name?” she asked. 

“I don’t fucking know.” Torch answered. “It’s not like they just said, ‘your name is Torch now’. I 

came back from processing and the place in my head my name should be in was filled with ‘Torch’.” 

“You think that’s bad?” interjected another woman seeing the perturbed look on Julia’s face. “A 
girl I see sometimes had her name changed to ‘Titsy’ for misbehaving. She answers to it and everything.” 

Julia found herself wondering whether Jigglibits had been forced to answer to that name even 

from herself. The thought was unsettling at a very deep level. 

Within the broader population of the pod Julia was very far from being the only one who might 

complain that her body had been rendered ridiculous. At least her breasts looked like something that 
grew there—several women’s ballooning chests were obviously 
 to look fake. But there were 
supposed
​
stranger things. Elaborate hairdos and complex makeup seemed a permanent feature of some. Julia 
spoke to one woman who had an actual extra pair of breasts bellow her first, all ‘real’ in whatever sense 
that had here—they all delivered sensations to her brain. Another had eyes approaching the impossible 
dimensions of an anime character. And, at a distance, Julia had several times seen a woman who’s panty 
seemed barely to contain a full afro sprouting from her lap.

Each day ended with a portion of time in which, his official duties completed, he was at liberty 

to enjoy the wonders of the City. Though truth be told, of late, he had done very little enjoying wonders. 
His eventual prize was ever before his eyes, and in service of it spare time tended to be subsumed by 
further work.  There were methodological alterations to work on, and he refined and re-refined the set 
up in his recruiting suite. There was also, it had to be admitted, a workaholic tendency to turn to labor as 
balm for anxiety. 

But tonight he felt at loose ends, worn out, and in need of something to lift his spirits. As he 

loitered in an airy exchange unsure where to go next, Kel’s thoughts meandered back over recent events 
and frustrations. The battleax business woman who had been so condescending came to mind and, 
along with her, the tag he’d planted. Pulling out his pad he scanned his tags. Sure enough a recent one 
was labeled only “that bitch.” Debra Keane’s record came right up.  

Apparently she’d been uncooperative right out of the gate—no surprise there—and had already 
undergone a disciplinary reassignment. He saw her current assignment and grinned. Perfect. Paying her 
a visit suddenly sounded like exactly the way he’d like to relax. He directed his steps to sector Rho-12. 
Kel didn’t rush. He followed back routs and took his time. The City was, at least relative to its 
own internal spatial orientation , vertically stratified. At the top were the grand edifices, the Tower of 
the First Circle, the Shaperate Academy, the houses of archons and others who had spaces of their own. 
Beneath that broad thoroughfare and beautifully designed spaces housed the places of work and

arbitrarily. 

​
residence for many of the lesser citizens. Kel’s small apartment, embedded in a block of identical 
apartments, was on this level, as were foundries, training centers, the analytical cores, and so on. At the 
bottom limit of this portion, just above the open sectors, lay the Hierogamic Core itself. Bellow the open 
sectors was the realm of the tenders and, at the very bottom extremity, the many storage pods of the 
guest population. 

Kel dropped down a transport shaft so that he could amble through the warren of transfer 
tunnels that underlay the open sectors. The constant traffic of the tenders moving equipment and 
women from where they were stored to where they were needed was tranquil compared to the crowds 
on the public streets above. He could also have taken the spacious, straightforward ways reserved for 
citizens, but tonight, somehow, picking his way through here seemed appealing. He took advantage of 
the time to anticipate the spicy sweetness of remaking “Ms. Kean’s” acquaintance. He popped up to 
street level just next door to his destination so that he could enter through the front door. 

Debra had first been assigned as a dancer, a roll, it seemed, she had staunchly refused to fulfill. 

Lewd gyration of her body for the enjoyment of others was not in keeping, perhaps, with her standing as 
an executive. Likely her mouth also had something to do with it. Her standing had not prevented her 
from being swiftly reassigned into a roll which called for a far less agency on her part. That was how Kel 
ended up in

 for the first time. It was not at all the sort of place he’d ordinarily have sought. 
Surface
​

Strolling in through the glass doors he found himself in a waiting area among a number of 

middle aged men trying to appear patient. The décor had clear orientalist elements but not overdone 
and combined with the sleek lines of modernism. A black samurai armor stood on a stand in one corner. 
Maroon upholstered benches rimmed the room. He strode up to a young host standing behind a sleek 
counter.  

The host nodded in recognition of a fellow citizen.“What can I do for you?” he asked in a muted 

tone. 

“I’d like a table, to myself if that’s possible.” 
“Sure, we can do that.” The host answered easily. Kel’s heart beat faster. Rank in the city carried 

privilege in enjoying the delights of the public sectors. High rank could mean great latitude and 
substantial accommodation. But even at Kel’s level small considerations could often be had when it 
wasn’t too disruptive to the flow of operations. 

“One more thing, can I get that table with this guest?” He held up his pad. 
The other man grinned jovially. “You’re in luck. She’s not engaged right now. I’ll have somebody 

show you right up. It’s been a fairly slow night.”  

“And these guys?” Kel gestured to the six men waiting to be taken to a table. 
“It’s part of procedure. Builds anticipation and projects mimetic valuation. You know.” 
Kel nodded mildly surprised. “You’re the host?” The man had not looked mature enough for

such a rank.  

His interlocutor indicated the affirmative. “I hope you enjoy your meal.” He winked. 
Kel loitered in the lobby for a few minutes letting his eyes trace the bamboo print pattern 

adorning the walls. He was feeling almost giddy. Presently, a neatly dressed waiter arrived and led him 
inside. Each table was housed in a private dining room meant for a group, so it was not feasible for an

ordinary patron to get one all to himself. He followed the waiter along dark, tastefully decorated halls, 
up a flight of stairs, and finally through a heavy curtain of cool onyx beads screening the room beyond 
from view . 

There, in the middle of thickly carpeted room, was his table. Debra lay supine, her body 
protruding from the surface of the ovular platform as if she were floating on it. The broad, black 
pedestal which held the table and imbedded woman a few feet aloft concealed her back side. But above 
the glassy surface which ringed her on all sides the woman was entirely nude. Her loose hair cascaded 
out over the glassy surface from her half-imbedded head, her arms lay at her sides immobile implanted. 
Her breasts stood tall and proud. Kel’s stayed at the periphery of the room and communicated his menu 
selection by pointing. The waiter departed, and Kel was left alone. 

The template for 

was the practice of nyotaimori, of course. Thus most of the tables 
Surface 
​

contained slender Japanese girls. But the formula had been broadened a bit to engage other tastes, and 
thus a few dining rooms housed women of other ethnicities, usually well endowed. Likewise the menu 
was rather more diverse: after an august sushi section it let its hair down and offered such items as ice 
cream sundaes and chocolate mousse--even spaghetti dinner by candle light. 

Lurked in the doorway for a long moments. He could hear her Debra breathing and see her bare 

chest rising and falling. He had a pleasing awareness of the asymmetry of their positions for he could 
survey her full length, but was shielded from her view by the immobility of her head.  

Finally, he sidled into her field of vision. “Good evening, Ms. Keane,” he tried to sound as 

composed as possible. 

“You!” she hissed in surprise, her eyes narrowing to hostile slits. 
He sat down at her flank. “Our last meeting felt a bit strained. I thought perhaps we could 

smooth things out over dinner. Or under it.” He could not forego a smirk at this. “That is, of course, if 
you don’t need me to get my manager.” 

The older woman said nothing, but her face betrayed a world of hostility. 
“You didn’t have these during out last meeting,” he gentry prodded a grapefruit sized breast 

with his index finger. “It suits you.” 

“Don’t touch me!” she growled. 
Kel laughed. “Oh Ms. Keane, don’t be so standoffish. This is our chance to get to know each 
other better. I’ve ordered whipped cream and cherries to share. I’m sure,” he continued, moving his 
finger lightly down her torso, “that we’ll come to an understanding.” 

The look on the seething woman’s face as his fingers nestled into her neat, dark bush would 

keep him contended in his work for cycles to come.

Deep in the storage pods rumors swirled and incubated. The groups of isolated women with 

little to do but talk was an ideal environment. But, beyond that, it was policy that not many women kept 
in the same pod would ever be assigned to the same scenario. Thus it seemed each woman had seen 
something, heard something, had something whispered in her ear, that no one else was in a position to 
know. 

And, at least to the few who paid any head to such matters, it was impressive how rapidly a 

rumor might spread between pods. Like a furtive game of telephone, hushed bits of discourse carried 
stories across the gap between the intentionally isolated groups swiftly and often. This back channel 

​
susurrus distorted as it transmitted, and a single bit extrapolated from an experience would soon exist in 
nine versions in nine different mouths. 

Escape was an almost obsessive topic of interest. Despite the space they occupied existing in a 
dream, many were still convinced that a physical rout somewhere lead outside of this realm and their 
confinement in it. Naturally many located this passage to freedom where they had first entered the City. 
But accounts of where the atrium lay or, for that matter, of local geography at the most basic level 
agreed in virtually nothing. Nonetheless, somebody always knew someone who knew—
—where the gap in the wall lay. 
knew
​

Other stories were unspecific sources of hope. Five women made a break and only three were 
ever dragged back for punishment. A masculine looking woman had passed herself off as a tender for 
several days and been able to move through the city at will. And then there was the tale which had 
quickly taken on the dimensions of myth about the group of escaped women hiding in the tunnels and 
fighting a stealthy war against their captors. The specifics varied, but the pattern was the same: they 
were like ghosts, moving through deep forgotten passages where the men couldn’t find them. But here 
and there somebody had caught a glimpse or overheard a guard lamenting one of their exploits in 
hushed tones. 

really 

The mirror to this were the darker rumors, tails of terrible reassignments and fates, of surreal 

punishments, and realities even more dismal. A tale circulated of women existing with no heads. 
Another held that, contrary to the prevailing wisdom that it was impossible, some women had 
undergone mysterious dream pregnancies. It was even whispered darkly that when the end of a 
woman’s stay arrived she wasn’t really freed, but rather shuffled off to some new misery never to be 
seen again.  

A well-worn story to be heard nearly everywhere told of a locked up woman, or perhaps more 

than one, with breasts were the size of pianos (this particular description of size was remarkably 
invariant between tellings). She, or they, were confined in a room barely larger than their swollen 
bodies, the doors of which they could not even fit through. One who neared the florid glow coming from 
the open door of that room would be haunted by the plaintive cries coming from within. It had come to 
function as a kind of ghost story, and perhaps also an indirect way of reiterating that it could always be 
worse. 

Then their brief reprieve would end. The conversations would cease. They’d lie on their cots. 

The cycle would begin again.

Prologue 

As she stood in front of the door Jacky had misgivings. The storefront looked like the sort of 

place a laundromat should be, or a sticky little Pizzeria. The glass windows stared back at her blankly, 
displaying nothing. The unassuming sign above the door did read “Collective Financial”, but it was just a 
banner rather than a true sign. Still, if what her friend had told her was true perhaps this was exactly the 
sort of spot she should have expected. And she’d followed the rumor this far. Taking a deep breath, she 
thrust open the doors and walked in. 

Her first impression upon entering was of a lot of empty space. Only a few desks stood to take 
up the space that had at some point been a retail space. Warn carpeting in a faded blue showed wear 
patterns that no longer corresponded to anything. “Can I help you?” inquired a man sitting at a desk 
directly in front of her. He had on a suit and tie and looked reputable enough. 

“Yes,” Jacky answered and then pause—if the story wasn’t true she’d look ridiculous, and how 

likely was it to be, really? “I heard you offer, uh, loans? At really good rates?” 

The man behind the desk looked her up and down with interest as if sizing her up. Apparently 

satisfied with what he saw he smiled, “You heard correctly. We’re granting some small loans. Have a 
seat.” He gestured to an empty folding chair. 

“Free money,” was how it had actually been described to Jacky by Lana, a college friend who 

was still in town. “There’s a cult or something that’s giving out loans. But it’s like they’re just handing out 
cash because you really don’t have to give the money back! It’s some crazy psychobabble—like they’ll 
reposes your thoughts or something. Basically, you take the money, and never pay it back!” She had at 
that point held up a wad of twenties for emphasis.  

Lana wasn’t the sort of friend you trust implicitly—quite the opposite actually: she was the sort 

of unreliable friend who perpetually exaggerated and repeated rumors as facts. But she was waving a 
wad of bills, and her story did not collapse into hearsay when she was questioned. She’d been able to 
give some specifics, and even produce an odd looking paper that did indeed look like the sort of thing a 
cult might provide when giving out loans.  

Nonetheless, Jacky was startled to discover Jacky had been, by-and-large, correct. She could 

really use a few hundred dollars—who couldn’t? And this had been a “what could it hurt” situation. But 
the man sitting across the desk from her outlined much the same deal Lana had described: she could 
borrow a small sum “against her presence in the collective unconscious continuum”. The man would 
have fit just as well in a proper bank, though his desk was nicked and discolored as if handed down from 
long use. Of the other four desks only two were occupied.  

Still suspicious Jacky probed for the catch. What were the interest rates? Quite low. Was this 

legal. Yes, it complied fully with applicable state usury laws. Where did the money come from? A small 
corporation formed by private investors with a unique perspective. If she fell behind in repaying would 
collectors show up at her home? No, under no circumstances, and she could get that in writing—the 

​
investors were quite satisfied with intangible assets, the sort of things burly men in trucks weren’t much 
use for obtaining. 

Finally, “But why? Why are you guys giving out these loans?” 
“Miss Fairfield, Jacky, the corporation I represent is offering these as a service. The perspective 

of the people whose money I’m disposing is rather different than yours, radically different in all 
probability. Trust me when I say that from our point of view, this deal seems like a good one: small loans 
can be offered to deserving parties such as yourself at much better rates than payday lenders, and you 
can use as collateral something which everybody has.” 

It took nearly thirty minutes for her to finally accept what was being offered. But in the end she 

slid a proffered document across the distressed desk with her signature on it and, in reply, the man 
reached into a drawer and pulled out a wad of bills. She left the cheap little storefront with cash in her 
pocket all but given to her by some new age eccentrics. Sometimes life was alright! 
 
 
Chapter 1: Arrivals 

Ambassador Kel was having a rough morning. He was behind quota, and his current session was 
shaping up to be an ordeal. He wasn’t actually an ambassador yet, only a recruiter, and that was part of 
1
the trouble: the Ambassador core, perhaps even more than other divisions in the City, was meritocratic . 
They faced a constant numerical need that must be met so successes were rewarded and failures quickly 
washed out. And full Ambassador position were, of course, much sought after, not only for the status 
that accompanied them, but for the private quarters, the privileges, and the prospect of kept pets. Thus 
the position of a recruiter could feel somewhat precarious as many motivated people competed for the 
same prizes. 

 That said, Kel had been able to report pretty reliable success for a while now, he had some 

rhetorical gifts, and showed some creativity within the existing formats, and promotion had begun to 
feel increasingly within his grasp. But then a day like this gave the dismaying feeling of his prize being 
yanked back out of his hands. Scenarios flitted through his mind of being knocked back down to 
technician work. Plausible or not, it was hard to entirely put them out of one’s mind. 

But he was doing his best to ignore them, and his anxiety generally, so that he could focus on 
the task at hand, that being a solo recruiting session that seemed to be going off the rails. The dossier 
said that the woman, perhaps ten years his senior, was a business woman, a manager in insurance of 
some kind. He felt he could have filled that in for himself after speaking with her for a few minutes, her 
entire posture and attitude gave it away, even ignoring her short dark hair and businesslike attire. She 
was clearly, he thought, one of those people who was addicted to being a boss. 

Kel wasn’t wrong. In her day job Ms. Debra Keane was something of a terror to her 

subordinates, and she relished negotiation as sport. Her session with Kel had started smoothly enough. 
Honestly, the deal he offered seemed a good one, and she had every intention of taking it, but her 
instinctive sense alerted her to something in this young man’s manner that betrayed anxiousness to 
close the deal. With no reason to do so beyond her own enjoyment, she’d decided to exact some 
concessions, leaning back in her chair and relishing the opportunity to make this young man squirm a 
bit.  

1 Indeed, women were allowed to work as ambassadors, the only place in the City where they could rise to such 
official positions. They could not formally achieve the rank of ambassador, of course, but they had a simulated rank 
high enough to enjoy some latitude and to outrank many men. 

“So about the conditions of my visit

” Debra began again. She and Kel sat across a small 

wooden table from each other, with some documents in between. Kel sometimes glanced at his pad, 
while Debra fixed him with a cat-like stare. 

…

“Yes?” 
“It says here,” she said, pointing at a line in a document open in front of her, “that my stay will 

be for a ‘standard duration’.” 

“Yes, and you can find details on the length of a standard stay if you’ll turn to section 3.B
“Yes, yes, not to my point.” Debra cut him off. “It seems to me that I ought to have some

latitude in determining the length of my visit.” 

how this ordinarily works.” 

Kel did his best to keep his face from betraying his reaction to this. “Well, Ms. Keane, that isn’t 

“And why would I be interested in how it normally works, young man? I don’t recall having 
asked about that. What I’m suggesting is that perhaps the standard stay is not to my liking. It seems only 
reasonable that if I’m to come the duration, and some other particulars of my stay should be worked out 
more specifically. Of course, if you don’t have the authority to depart from what is standard perhaps you 
could let me speak to somebody who does?” 

Kel gritted his teeth. “What do you have in mind, Ms. Keane?”  
 

●  ●  ● 

 
Julia found herself in a drab little room with no clear idea how she’d gotten there. She was 
reclining on a pedestal that took up most of the small chamber. Half rising, she could see slate grey walls 
all around, black tiled floor below, grey ceiling above. Directly before her was a closed door which 
looked as if it might be made of metal.  

Where was she? And how on earth had she gotten there? No answers to the questions were 

forthcoming. She searched her memory but turned up only bits of a mundane day: trivial events at work, 
humus at lunch, reading a cheap novel in bed at the end of it. The trail ended there unhelpfully. She 
swung her legs off the platform and rose. The room was small, essentially a cell. There were no windows 
and only the one door, though it was brightly lit and didn’t look at all dingy—more like a night club 
bathroom than a prison cell. She tried the door but found that it lacked a handle and would not yield to 
pushing. It was at this point that she noticed she was wearing her pajamas. 

Julia was beginning to becoming perturbed, even a bit frightened, though she didn’t panic.  She 

banged on the door and called, “Hello! Can anyone hear me? Hello!” The door reverberated in a way 
that seemed quite solid.  

A moment later she started as the door almost silently swung away. In the doorway stood a man 

in a blue and burgundy uniform. His shirt fit tightly as if it were athletic wear, while his pants were cut 
more like cargo pants. “Hello, Miss,” he greeted before Julia recovered from her start enough to say 
anything, “Sorry for the delay. If you would come with me please.” He stepped aside and gestured 
through the doorway. 

“Where are you going?” Julia asked, unsure how else to reply. 
“If you’ll just come this way, we’re going to the orientation.” Replied the uniformed man as if 

this was perfectly clear. 

“Orientation? But
“If you’ll just come this way, Miss, the orientation should answer that.” 

where are we?” 

…

Unsure what else to do, and reassured by the man’s official politeness, Julia followed him from 
the room into a bright hallway beyond. She was lead along a corridor featuring many doors like the one 
she’d just come to, into a higher, wider hall. The uniformed man led her along at a brisk pace, his boots 
clumping and her bare feet padding on the smooth cool floor behind him.  

Soon the hallway terminated in a room of enormous dimensions. Julia paused in surprise and 

gazed around. The room was long and tall like an airplane hangar. She and her guide had entered 
mid-way along one long wall. There were many other figures moving about the room, including quite a 
few more men uniformed like this one, and others in attire she did not recognize. Many of the men 
seemed to be leading women in ones or small groups. There were also some sizeable pieces of 
equipment standing here and there the function of which Julia couldn’t even guess. She only had a 
moment to take all this in before her escort, noticing she’d stopped, turned and said, “Please follow me, 
Miss. It’s not far.” Falling in with him again she glanced back over her shoulder at the wall from which 
she’d just entered the towering space. It was honeycombed with openings such that already she 
couldn’t be certain which she’d come from. She’d exited at floor level, but above that were two more 
tiers of doorways and openings. Stairways connected these tiers to the floor, and masses of tubes and lit 
bands ran throughout as if the entire wall were some sort of futuristic pipe organ.  

Even more quickly than before, her guide led her across the remainder of the wide room and 

through a much more ordinary looking set of double doors in front of her followed by a second set. She 
found herself standing in what seemed to be a small auditorium. Or, at least, it had a raised stage on one 
side, though there were no seats. “Please wait here,” the man said, “your orientation will begin shortly.” 
And with that he turned on his heel and departed. 

 

 

●  ●  ● 

 
Kel breathed a sigh of relief as Debra finally exited his little recruiting suite. Glancing down at his 

pad he cursed—that had taken a very long time and what should have been his next session had been 
rerouted to someone else during the delay. He’d been subjected to a string of little changes and 
concessions at the business end of her condescending smirk, but the heart of things had remained 
intact. It had seemed touch-and-go for a bit as she picked at the contract clause by clause. He’d been 
simultaneously worried that she’d notice too much of what the document actually meant, and that one 
of her arbitrary demands would break things by dumb luck. But a bit of quick reverse psychology had 
focused her discussion of fixing her stay’s duration on extending her visit, and everything else had 
turned out to be trivial. In sum she’d been too busy torturing him to notice the big picture. 

He didn’t have long to relish the feeling of relief. If he was going to make up lost time he’d need 

to rush to set up the suit for the next appointment. But he did take a moment while he was filing 
Debra’s contract to tag her profile. The thought of checking in on her a little later warmed him deep 
down. He allowed himself a smirk. 

●  ●  ● 

 
The room was quickly filling up. There had already been a few women standing uncertainly 

about the place when Julia found herself among them, and the uniformed men were escorting more in 
all the time. They’d bring the women in and then withdraw to the periphery where a row of them, 
apparently at attention, now limned the room. Looking around the throng Julia saw a lot of women who, 
like her, seemed like they might have recently been in bed. Some women looked as confused as she, but 

many others seemed somewhat nonchalant. With the exception of all being relatively youthful—Julia 
didn’t see anyone who looked much over forty—they didn’t seem to share any unifying characteristics. 
Leaning towards a black woman in a bathrobe roughly her own age, Julia asked, “Do you know 

where we are?” 

 

“Yeah,” she said, “This is the resort that

small stage stood a man in blue and burgundy. He was clad like the others except with added indications 
of seniority: his shoulders bore neat epaulets, he had on a beret with an insignia on the front, and his 
thick mustache had hints of grey in it. “Hello, ladies. If I may have your attention, we can begin.” Every 
eye was on him. 

“Now, strip down to the waist.” He spoke with calm assurance as if he had just instructed them 
to close their eyes or cross their fingers. A hint of a smirk might have played around the corners of the 
mustache, but then again it might not have. There was a murmur throughout the room. Women glanced 
around to see if anybody else was complying. Nobody was. The statement was so jarringly discordant 
with the tone in which it had been stated that most were unsure how to react. 

“It seems you don’t yet understand the import of the instruction. I’ll repeat myself momentarily, 

but in the meantime I will lay things out quite clearly.” 

 

●  ●  ● 
 

Emerging from his final session of the day Kel was spent. He was also somewhat dispirited. He 

had, with great effort, wrestled his numbers back to a more respectable place. But even after the 
marathon session he was still not a place he was entirely happy with. He grumbled invective against 
Debra Keane the great and powerful as he trudged across the atrium to his hub, contract case in hand. 

A blue-uniformed tender touched his shoulder as he passed. “Just so you know, Archon Ra is on 

the floor.” 

Kel nodded his gratitude for the heads up and his friend acknowledged with a wave as he moved 
off about his duties. Ra was the archon ultimately overseeing the entire diplomatic apparatus and had a 
hand in maintaining and developing the Antechambers . He sat on the City’s First Circle. A visit from him 
was not too unusual as he liked to be directly involved in the operations he oversaw. And he was fairly 
well liked, but still intimidating in virtue of both rank and a reputation for brilliance. Just now Kel was a 
bit apprehensive about how an interaction with the boss of his bosses might go. 

2

After slotting the new batch of contracts into the system, Kel lingered to look at the grand board 

that displayed a summary of the day’s recruiting activity. Each hub had such a board, showing neatly 
tabulated numbers not just for the staff working out of that hub, but for the Ambassadors’ entire 
recruitment efforts. It might be disappointing to see his own relative standing, but there was also some 
satisfaction to be taken from what his labor contributed to. His hard work, after all, did contribute to a 
vital requirement for the City’s operation. Momentarily absorbed by the columns of figures he didn’t 
notice Archon Ra walk up beside him. 

“Recruiter Kel,” Ra greeted him quietly.  

2 “The Antechambers” was the collective name given to the constellation of interconnected spaces where 
recruiting primarily took place. Some were as small as a few rooms, some larger and more elaborate, a vast, 
decentralized edifice, constantly being altered and redesigned.. They were not part of the City proper and well 
beyond its boundaries, a reality necessitated by the venerable law that a woman could only set foot in the City 
after signing a contract.  

Kel was jarred out of his thoughts and swiveled to face his superior. “Archon, greetings.”  
Ra was garbed impressively, as was his habit. He wore a black duster crisscrossed with patterns 

of glowing blue. “You just came off a shift, yes? How did it go?” 

“Not amazingly. I got off to a slow start and spent a long time in one problem session. I’m 

hoping to do better tomorrow.” 

Ra nodded. “Everybody has such days. The flux of human behavior isn’t something that can ever 

fully be mastered. But I’ve been looking at the work of this hub, at your work, and it has been sound, 
even quite promising in places.” He added, a wry smile on his angular face, “In other words you may 
relax.” There was a reason Ra was well liked. 

“I wonder,” the young archon continued, “do you have any ideas for new recruiting methods? I 

find that newer personal often bring newer ideas.” 

“Well,” Kel responded tentatively, “I’ve already been experimenting a bit with ways of setting up 

group sessions. I think there’s potential for sessions witch much bigger groups at once.” 

Ra let the vagueness of this suggestion pass. “Potential, though also logistical difficulty. Such a 

plan would need to see significant success to justify itself.” he mused. “If you were promoted, might this 
be something I could expect you to undertake?” 

Kel nodded. He actually had many ideas though he wasn’t about to spout all his half-finished 
thoughts in front of Ra. Feeling rather bolder Kel decided to ask a question his recent experience had 
literal? I’m not questioning the 
again made salient. “Sir, must the contracts we offer be so precisely
policy, but obviously recruiting would be easier if we weren’t so constrained in what we said.” 

…

Ra smiled. “It’s a good question, one every recruiter should ask. Yes, obviously lying would work 
better for getting signatures, so why mst we universally refrain from lying? Do you know about the role 
of culpability?” 

Lacking confidence he even knew what the word meant, Kel shook his head. 
“Ah. Well, unlike physical matter which follows simples rules of cause and effect, the Somnole is 

fundamentally psychological. It responds to psychological principles—you could think of it as having 
feelings about how things out to be. In essence, matter only asks where and when, but the stuff we 
made all this out of,” he gestured broadly, “also asks why.” 

“If we don’t give it a good reason, it’s much more difficult to make things stick, especially certain 

sorts of things. And it takes great power to operate counter to the deep laws. We wish to keep a great 
many people here daily. So, we must provide a reason for them to be here which the Somnole itself 
accepts. We must show that we follow the logic of the mental depths.” 

Kel nodded. Apparently this was a lucky day after all as he was getting a personal lesson in 

abstracta from one of the premier intellects in the city. 

“Culpability is the answer.” Ra went on. “We need them to be guilty of something. This provides 

a kind of hood. Why are they here? Well, because they deserve to be. Then, instead of flouting our 
efforts, the stuff of the Somnole will cooperate with them. So the point of the contract is not to have the 
signature—we could readily secure that in any number of ways—it is the signing. They must freely sign 
in a way that renders them culpable, that is to blame,” he added graciously, “for so doing. That provides 
a kind of hook we can use to tether them here. If we lied through our teeth all the culpability would lie 
on us and we would have no hook. We would never be able to keep them all here.”  

“So,” Kel hazarded, “the guests must deserve to be here?” 
“In a certain sense. But don’t take the metaphors too literally. We needn’t show that they 
actually 
 to be here. That’s the sort of thing you show to a conscious mind, and anyway, do you 
deserve
​
really think we could show it? No, we just need them to have some guilty which the dark stuff beneath 

​
the subconscious will accept as a pretext. It’s the same sort of thing that provides that feeling about who 
should die in a horror film. A reason that feels right, though it needn’t be a perfect one.” 

“But there are other ways of getting that ‘hook’ ?” 
“Yes, though all founded on the same principle of culpability.” Naturally Kel had heard of one or 

two other methods that were routinely used, but they were not where most recruitment came from, 
and he’d never directly worked with any. “The City’s recruiters have tried a great many things down the 
years. Likely you’ve heard of the published incantation, as it still yields regular recruits. At one point, 
some of our people actually opened loan offices in New Jersey.” 

Ra grinned in a way that authorize laughing at this, and Kel and the Archon shared did so 

together before Ra departed to continue his work. 

 

●  ●  ● 

 
The man onstage certainly had the undivided attention of his audience now. He continued in the 

same, calm tone, “You have all chosen to come here, and you have all signed contracts or otherwise 
entered into compacts,” he held up a contract as if to illustrate, “which impose certain requirements. 
Since you freely entered these agreements, it is reasonable to expect you to abide by them.” 

…

“If I must spell this out

” He opened the document with expert hands and began to read, “ 
‘Admittance will be granted to an exclusive resort, filled with marvelous sights, wonder, and sensual 
delights for a stay of finite duration.’ But that’s just an excerpt from the introduction. Consider clause 
4.E, ‘Visitors will participate in fantasy scenarios. And participants in the scenarios will accommodate 
themselves to the fantasy in question, in form, behavior, and etc.’ it continues in that vain. Many 
specifics are adduced.” 

“But consider, whose fantasy is to be followed is not here specified. You may have assumed it 
was you. Many do. But no such statement was made. In fact,” he again leafed through the document, 
“clause 6.C is quite clear that ‘the scenarios, or fantasies, to be enacted are not exclusively or primarily 
those of the visitor (you).’ “ There was murmuring around from around the room—the verbiage was 
familiar, but like an optical illusion its meaning was shifting before their eyes. This murmering intensified 
at the speaker’s next statement. “We could go on adducing specifics, but the point is that you agreed to 
behave in accordance with a fantasy scenario as yet unspecified. I now specify—for the moment I am 
the one whose fantasy you must accommodate. And I fantasize thus: strip down to the waist. 
Understand that, by your own free contract, you are obliged to do this.” 

There was a significantly louder commotion this time, but still no stripping. From all over the 

room came questions, objections, flat-out denials. This was not what anyone had expected, and some 
were beginning to feel that it might be time to leave. A woman with a round face and frizzy brown hair 
made a break the doors by which she’d entered. Before others could follow suite she was seized by 
several uniformed men. In incredibly short order she was hoisted bodily, gagged, blindfolded, and 
hogtied to a thick which pole which was quickly screwed together in sections. Small tools which buzzed 
loudly were produced and in short order the woman’s cloths were shorn away so that her body, bare of 
all but its restraints, writhed uncomfortably between the shoulders of two uniformed men.  

All this transpired in little more than a minute. And everyone had seen it. Reluctantly, all over 

the room, garments began falling to the floor. 

“Good.” Said the officer, “You have followed your contracts thus far. Now allow me to explain 

things a little further. You are going to stay here, in this facility, for the duration of the time contractually 
agreed to. In that time, you are going to serve in a variety of fantasies, as you have contractually agreed 

to do. All this is required of you. You do not have to approve it. Your only choice is to keep your word 
and cooperate, or refuse and break your word. Those that cooperate may yet find this the garden of 
sensual delights they were hoping for, as it can be. Those who do not

clicked his fingers. In response to this signal several figure moved onto stage with him, “

may find 

…

…

The new persons on stage took a moment to make sense of, but soon a collective gasp went up 

from the women in the room, many with arms slung over their bare chests. In front walked one of the 
uniformed men holding a leash, which was easy enough. But the leash was tugging another figure along 
behind. (Generally, when we have a visual impression of a person, our subconscious applies some 
standard templates to decode the image without our even noticing. Thus we pass men and women on 
the street and recognize them as such more or less automatically. But sometimes a thing is so far from 
normal parameters that this automatic process founders, and we consciously realize we must decode 
what we are staring at. Think of the first moments in which you looked at the Venus of Willendorf. That 
is what now happened here.) It was a woman. A mass of fine, bleached curls topped a very female form, 
almost entirely occluding the head such that only the chin protruded. Monumental hips tapered to 
dainty feet, making for legs with the shape of preposterous cones. The slim body connecting these was 
almost entirely hidden by two mammoth breasts, swelling mounts which dangled to just past her waist 
and protruded whole feet in front of her. This wobbling mound of pail flesh was barely graced by 
clothes, and the string bikini which was implausibly wrapped around her highlighted more than it hid: 
the triangle of black fabric at her waist merely sat in the middle of a blonde thicket twice its size, and the 
two on her chest not far above were stretched out like tents which failed to fully cover the darker pink 
plots on which they were pitched. Little red heeled shoes and a thick red collar completed the ensemble. 

This creature now teetered across the stage, pulled without gentleness by the uniformed man. 

She must have been entirely unable to see, but her wobbling gate seemed to be more a matter of 
weight and balance. With each deliberate step her bulging haunches and mountainous chest quivered 
and swayed; one could surmise that faster movement would see her simply topple to the floor. The last 
thing to register was that this creature’s arms weren’t visible. They turned out to be behind her, hands 
bound together in a sleeve from which a little red purse was hanging, immobilized behind her massive 
rump. 

“Jigglibits here,”  he patted one meaty mammary sending it quivering, “used to be less

impressively proportioned. But she was perpetually uncooperative, and this resulted in her being 
reassigned to a scenario in which this was the form she needed to take. You’ll find that here, things 
you’ve previously taken for granted can be rather fluid. So cooperate, as you’ve agreed to do. Do not try 
to escape, and do not assault personnel or other visitors to the facility. Follow these rules and you may 
well have an enjoyable stay. Break them, and you will discover, as Jigglibits has, that there is always a 
fantasy less to your liking you can be participating in.” 

“Now,” he paused and looked out at the stunned audience before him, “strip the rest of the 

way.” As his order was met with rapid compliance from around the room he smiled outright. “Welcome 
to the City, ladies.” 

Julia stood in a room full of naked, stunned, women. She finally had some idea where she was. It 

was not a comfort.

It had been a bachelorette party activity. As is typical for such events, it was selected not 
primarily for itself, but rather for how suggestive it could be. Julia was there to celebrate the upcoming 
marriage of her friend Amy, a waifish little blonde who had dabbled in Wicca intermittently as an 
adolescent. The organizer of the party, cognizant of this, had put spell casting on the list of 
activities—something to be produced when a few fruity drinks had already been consumed and anything 
to do with sex seemed like a good idea. In a book of “practical magic for powerful young women” the 
party’s organizer had dug up at a local library, she’d found a spell to “travel in sleep to a place of erotic 
delights” and she’d run Xerox copies off which she now handed out to the tipsy twenty-something 
women. Amy could have “one last wild night before her pussy closed up shop.” 

Julia had followed the directions on the little printout along with the others. The wording from 

the book was entirely po faced, even formal, which just made the whole thing that much funnier. 
Candles were produced (birthday candles, but still), incantations were read, names were signed in 
melted wax. Everybody more or less forgot about it by the end of their full evening. 

  

Cast this spell to travel in sleep to a place of unending erotic delights. Be wary though, this is not a spell 

for the faint or wilting: by casting, one opens and binds herself to powerful erotic forces. She who 
seeks to be whisked away in the night must seek also what follows, to be obedient in the ways of 
carnality, to take the form carnality requires! Quake ye innocents and turn back. Proceed at your 
own peril, ye seekers of Babylon, who seek in earnest to be tenderly touched by night, for you 
may get what you seek! 
 
 

Chapter 2: Processing 

The man on stage spoke continue to speak but most didn’t register his further words very well. 
The feminine figure bobbing next to him, whose chest he casually fondled as he spoke, drowned out his 
actual words (though the figure itself stood mutely throughout). Instinctively many in the room covered 
their own breasts as if by so doing to shield them from this swollen fate. 

As he concluded, doors were opened on the sides of the room, different doors than they had 
entered by, and one by one pairs of uniformed men entered and lead each nude woman out between 
them. There was a growing murmur in the small auditorium, and Julia, along with many others, was 
looking back and forth from the hogtied woman at the back of the room to the bulging one at the front. 
Perhaps if they made a break for it together
strong grip took hold of each of her arms. She was away to the left, feet barely touching the floor, and 
never saw whether some of the women left behind made another bid at escape. 

 But this thought was interrupted prematurely when a 

…

She found herself in a realm of white walls and white tile, an antiseptic space that felt very like a 
hospital. This feeling intensified when she was lead to a small room where she and several other women 
in her position were being loaded onto gurneys. “Where are you taking me?!” she cried repeatedly, or 
meant to, her words came out as a shrill whisper. 

“Processing,” replied one of her captor’s matter-of-fact-ly.  
“Processing?” the neglected words of the officer on stage floated back to her from short term 

memory: “You’ll all go now to be prepared for your visit. You will be individually processed to make you 
fit for the rolls you’ll occupy, and then you’ll be shown to your new quarters. Stay calm and all this this 
will be a smooth experience.” 

The woman being strapped to the gurney next to her had apparently not heeded these last 

words as she struggled vehemently with her captors, kicking, flailing, and roaring in frustration. But it 
made no difference, in short order the athletic looking Asian girl was tied down on the gurney, her face 
contorted in frustration. “Be quiet now,” one of her captor’s ordered, “or we’ll fill your mouth.” 

Julia allowed herself to be similarly strapped down. What was the point of resisting? Each 
gurney was pushed from the room by a single uniformed man. Julia was pushed head first, such that she 
could not see where she was going, only the bands of the lights overhead and the uniformed figure 
before her calmly pushing her along. She was entirely bare, splayed out in front of him like a pinned 
from. Though he seemed to take little notice, she had never felt so naked in all her life. This was soon to 
change. 

Her first stop was a brightly lit room where someone in a long white coat and gloves stepped to 
the side of her and looked her over intensely, glancing back and forth from her body to a tablet of some 
sort in his hand. It was as if he was making a minute study of every inch of her immobile form. Julia said 
nothing, only bit her lip and waited, quivering slightly within her restraints. She never even noticed the 
similarly clad figure from the other side approach until he jammed something over her mouth.  

She cried out in surprise. Within seconds a warm heavy feeling began to permeate her body. The 
cup over her mouth was removed, but she could feel her eyes begin to flutter. She struggled against the 
feeling and tried to cry out again, “What are you doing to me? No! Let me go
passed into oblivion, the man above her still manipulating his pad while scrutinizing her defenseless 
body. 

” but it was no use. She 

…

The rest of her journey through processing was a blur. Julia thought she’d been unconscious for 
most of it, but seemed to have been dimply aware at intervals. She remembered having her hair cut off, 
or at least that was what it felt like, warm bussing all over her scalp as several figures stood around her. 
In that recollection she seemed to have been propped upright.  

She also remember the feeling of latex-gloved hands all over her torso, though this recollection 

was matched with no visuals. It did not seem to have been erotic, just uncomfortable, and there had 
been some other odd pressures. Unrelated to this, she had a flash of seeing long glass tubes filled with 
thick translucent reds and yellows, and of a lab-coated man with odd eyewear, like night vision goggles, 
moving about among them. Beyond that, all was still blackness. And she did not return to full 
consciousness for some time. 

 

●  ●  ● 
 

Throughout processing Julia’s experience was replicated. Women were wheeled first into a 

room to be sedated and assigned. At this point even the women most vehement about not accepting 
their voluntarily undertaken fate fell silent. Their assignment would determine how they were routed 
through the remainder of the facility, room by room, until they came out the other side ready for action. 
Each woman was of course already in the system, and a tentative assignment was already matched to 
her profile before the orientation ended. But it was good to take a closer look to make sure the initial 
match was a good one and to note any issues that needed special attention. 

From here the tender pushing the card could simply follow color codes to navigate the rest of 

the facility like a production line. After each room was passed through, the cart itself would display the 
color corresponding with the next step, all following the approved processing profile. Some rooms were 
only brief visits, others could take quite some time. For example, denuding a visitor of hair, above or 
below, could be done by an unskilled technician with a simple tool in moments. Adding new hair was 

generally done from template, and though it took a bit longer to do the actual injecting and smoothing 
at the edges, it was an efficient process.  

Resculpting, on the other hand, was a process which really had to be individualized to each 

guest. Skilled artisans like Shaper Eld, who had worked on Julia, had templates at their disposal, to be 
sure, but these were just starting points. Applying them blindly, if it worked at all, would produce 
grotesque results, sometimes subtly, as when things simply did not match up in a way that would read 
as natural, sometimes grandly, as when a particular body just wasn’t as a template supposes. 

Eld enjoyed his work. His competence combined something of the technical nature of a surgeon 

and the aesthetic sense of a sculptor into one task, a task at which he excelled. But he did sometimes 
wish for a bit more creative liberty. His sessions consisted of doing very much the same thing over and 
over, with his skilled eye employed mainly to make it look good in each case. There was a challenge to it, 
but it was trivial compared to the allure of the blank canvas, the patient where he’d be given his head to 
do as he liked.  

The nearest to this he ever got, at the moment, were reprocessing cases where something really 

outlandish was called for. Sometimes these were just as proscribed as any ordinary process-y, but 
occasionally he’d be given only sparse instructions about the completed affect, and be left free to figure 
out how to achieve it. Though he was the oldest and second most senior shaper on the processing staff, 
he was far from the top shaper in the City.  So, for now, his ambitions must answer to the needs of the 
moment, and he’d have to content himself with bringing the pudgy 30-something who’d just been 
wheeled in front of him to the specified point.  

4

He envied the academy shapers who could experiment freely and develop new patterns which 

he then merely followed. But this was still enjoyable, he reminded himself—the curvy young thing 
before him was infinitely preferable to never-ending balance sheets. He allowed himself just a moment 
to appreciate the soft lines and pert pink nipples before he reached down towards the unconscious 
figure and began his work.

The first thing Julia became aware of was discomfort. At first it was just discomfort; It was full 

minutes before its source formed itself coherently in her mind. She was lying on top of something 
uncomfortable she dimly thought. Why’d she fallen asleep over the arm of the sofa? As she struggled 
back to consciousness the uncomfortable pressure beneath her torso grew until finally she opened her 
eyes and tried to rise. 

She only tried, because Julia did not actually succeed in sitting up on her first attempt. For 

reasons she could not at first grasp she rather half rose and then tumbled back to the position she’d 
been in. Eyes open now, her head cleared a bit and she recalled that she was not in her living room, a 
fact abundantly obvious in any case. Rather she lay face down on a cot in what looked like a bunk room. 
Simple bunk beds in rows sat on a wooden floor. A few of the beds seemed to have occupants, though 
most were empty. Blue-grey walls punctuated by standing mirrors lay at the edge of her still focusing 
vision. 

4 The truly virtuoso shapers would seldom be doing line work in processing. They were to be found in the ransk of 
the Shaperate at the Academy. Though shaping was one of the most skilled and prestigious jobs in all of 
processing, the high shapers who presided over the Shaperate, archons all, were some of the most elevated 
persons in the City. 

With another effort she managed to sit up on the cot, and only with further effort avoided 

toppling over again. Was she wearing a backpack or something? She looked at the cot to see what she’d 
been hunched over. Her still bleary mind declined to make sense of what she saw, which was nothing 
but the cot itself. She sat there, her legs swung over the edge of the bed, and tried to clear her head. 

The room, lit somewhat dimply, appeared to contain many rows of beds and little else. Here and 

there, at a distance, Julia could see other sleeping women, and a few up and walking around. From 
somewhere off to the right she could hear noises of voices and muted activity from what sounded like it 
must be a fair few people. She screwed her eyes shut and then opened them again. Where was she and 
why did she feel like she might tip over? 

She raised her hands to massage the sore places on her chest and finally noticed, with a start, 

that this was where the feeling of being weighted down originated. Her hands touched flesh much 
sooner than she expected and, looking down in surprise, she saw herself. The shock jarred her still 
returning senses. Staggering to her feet she nearly fell over again. But steadying herself, she shuffled 
over to one of the mirrors on a nearby wall and stood before it. There, staring back at her, she was. Julia 
gaped. In the mirror was a figure who, mostly, looked like the one she saw in the mirror each morning, 
with one glaring exception. 

In most particulars, Julia had not been greatly altered in processing. She’d always been an 
attractive girl, and at 22 still enjoyed the bloom of youth combined with a mature body. There had been 
some changes though. She’d been slimmed just slightly, losing a couple pounds of weight she’d put on in 
the last few years or working a day job, and some skin blemishes had been remove. More noticeable, 
her hair had been altered. Still brown, it was several shades lighter and a curly bob had replaced her 
loose pony tail. Her lips were ever so slightly fuller than they had been the day before. But none of this 
registered for some time. Her attention was entirely dominated by her chest. 

There, in defiance of reason and desire, two enormous breasts now hung. Gone was the C-cups 

…

bust that had filled out a swimsuit so nicely. In its place were two ludicrous mounds that must have 
 L cups? M? N? Her ability to fix letters to physical features had never till now had reason to 
been
extend past the first four letters of the alphabet and now it foundered in alphabetical absurdity. Each 
pendulous breast was more than a match for her head in mass, and hung down nearly to her naval. 
Aside from their size they looked natural, each pink orb swelling to its conclusion in a prominent nipple 
pointed just slightly downwards. She had to run her hands over each more than once to convince her 
addled mind they were really part of her at all. They were. 

She could feel emotion roiling inside of her as she stared, aghast. She looked like one of the 

things the guys in junior high had penned in the backs of English notebooks, like some lewd joke. She 
whimpered to herself as she continued to stare at her reflection. “What happened? Oh, god, what did 
they do to me?” 

A voice beside her, to her surprise, interrupted her confused moaning with an answer, “They 

gave you huge tits, honey.” 

Julia looked over to see a woman in her underwear. (Julia had not yet put together that 

everyone in the bunk room, save those like herself who were exempt from a bra, wore a uniform of 
simple white bra and panty.) She was older than Julia, perhaps in her late thirties. Her course, dark hair 
was pulled up into tight stubby pigtails. Her figure would have passed for buxom most places, but did 
not begin to rival the improbable proportions of Julia’s own new body. 

“What?” 

“I said they gave you huge tits,” she pointed, “that’s what they did to you. It’s a shock, but calm 

down, it could be a lot worse. Just calm down, honey.” She took the stunned Julia by the shoulders 
reassuringly and guided her back to an empty bed where she sat next to her. “What’s your name?” 

“Julia.”  
“Hi Julia. I’m Jacky.” The older woman responded. “It’ll be alright.” 
“But my body
“Yeah, it happens to all of us some way. It’s part of being here. But it’s not the worst thing. And 

” Julia began in a plaintive wail. 

…

hey, wouldn’t you have killed for tits like this a week ago?” 

Julia shook her head vehemently. There was a long pause before her addled brain grasped that 

it had been a joke. She smiled faintly. “Where am I?” 

“You’re in a bunk room. This is where you’ll be sleeping from here on. I stay here too. You just 

came out of processing, and you’re in the City.” 

Julia tried to take this in. “Why did they do this to me?” She again indicated her chest. 
“Because somebody wants you to look that way? Somebody thinks it’s hot. But they just 

changed your shape a little. You’ll be OK.” 

Julia whimpered, but again Jacky reassured her. “I’d guess it’s nothing too bad. Not like her,” she 

gestured at a slim black woman with a huge afro and bulging lips who passed them at some distance. 
“I’m guessing she’s going to spend a lot of time on her knees looking like that.” 

“On her knees?” 
“Yeah, they only focused on the part of her that guys will look down at, on her hair and face. It 

looks minor compared to your bazooms, but trust me, you wouldn’t want to trade with her.” 

“What will they do with me?” Julia cringed. 
“Don’t think about that now. Nothing you can’t handle. Just leave that for later. It will be alright, 

whatever it is. Right now, you need to rest.” 

slid heavily off her chest to either side. 

That will happen if you lie on your back.” 

This seemed like sense, and Julia went to lay back on the cot. To her consternation, her breasts 

“No, no, honey.” Jacky said, grabbing her arm and propping her back up. “You don’t sleep here. 

“But I can’t lie on top of them!” Julia almost howled.  
“It’s Ok. I know, honey. Follow me over here.” She raised the bleary Julia to her feet and led her 

to one corner of the block of beds. “Here, these are the special beds for girls like you,” she said, 
gesturing. Julia went to climb into one, but again Jacky stopped her, “No, honey, not on the bottom, on 
the top.” She half guided, half heaved the befuddled Julia up onto the top bunk and helped her get into 
position—no trivial task since Julia was having balance issues even while standing still. Finally Julia’s 
shocked and foggy mind grasped what was going on: there was a window cut out of the material bellow 
her just at chest level. Carefully, her breasts could be dangled through so that they hung free over the 
bed bellow while the rest of Julia was supported by the cot above. In any normal situation this would 
have been impossibly uncomfortable for at least three reasons, but Julia wasn’t in a normal situation. 
“Get some rest. You’ll feel better when the shit they dosed you with is all out of your system.” 

Jacky patted her shoulder comfortingly. 

back into unconsciousness in mere moments. 

Her head spinning, her breasts hanging like pendulums for all the world to see, Julia still sank

Not much is known with certainty about the founder of the City. The man who would later be 
called Adan, the High First Archon, didn’t seem to have been much interested in autobiography. Lore 
had it that he was an unsuccessful inventor from New England, a man with many patents but little 
money. He was a career bachelor some said, and an amateur astronomer said others. There was some 
reason to think his given name had been Hugh though a handful of other indications would have it as 
Sidney. 

It seems that around 1919 this man had begun a series of experiments into the nature of human 
dreaming. He was certainly not the first, nor the last, to embark on such an investigation. His own period 
had seen a reawakening of interest in dreams. Thanks largely to Sigmund Freud, scientific study of the 
mysterious recesses of the human subconscious was in fashion. And the terrain these European 
intellectuals were now trying to make sense of had been comfortably tramped by folk magic back almost 
to the dawn of human recorded history. Yet, in a few short years an anonymous man from New England 
would surpass all of them in his understanding of the mysteries of dreams. 

So Hugh, or was it Sidney?, seemed to bring a different perspective to his investigations. To him, 

somnolence was a place, a region with geography to be explored replete with its own perils and 
opportunities, not unlike opening up a new continent. This was the spirit world of the shaman, denuded 
of its magical elements. He thought of his peculiar, private researches as “expeditions”, and of himself as 
an explorer rather than as either a psychologist or a medicine man. He had built, it was said, odd 
apparatus to help him penetrate further, and practiced exercises of his own invention convinced that 
the right methods would see terra incognita open before him.  

And, whether in virtue of this conceptual device, an innate genius, or a combination of the two, 

these investigations did penetrate further than those of any of his contemporaries no matter how 
notable. Within two years he’d detected what most other had missed: the existence of a murky 
substratum bellow his own phenomenal dreams. And, having discovered it, rather than attempting to 
become famous off this discovery, as he surely could have, he decided to venture further in the dark 
alone. 

One can think of this substrate, the Somnole it would come to be called years later, as an Ocean. 

Like any good analogy this one has its shortcoming, but is still instructive. If the dreams individuals 
normally experience are warm coastal waters, then the Somnole is the cold, unfathomably deep water 
of the ocean in between. The same stuff flows into each, but the depths are vaster and qualitatively 
different. And just as the deep ocean had been an unseen reality for much of human history, so the dark 
depths of the Somnole had barely been glimpsed by human observers. 

It was out into these dark waters between the dreams of individuals that Adan now ventured.

term coined a few years earlier. And shamans and the like, as well as a few outlying dreamers, had 
ventured there and gotten some intimation of its nature. In fact, one might say that in many periods, 
right back into antiquity, it was generally accepted that some unseen expanse linked human dreams.  
It is not known what year he first successfully crossed out of his own dreams through the dark 

and into the dream of another. But he was the first modern man to deliberately do it, and to know what 
he had done. And again, he passed up status as a visionary scientist or cultic figure to plunge even 
deeper into the abyss. When this anonymous man, a crank in the eyes of those who took any notice of 
him, found himself in a land Jung had glimpsed and magi had tremulously passed through, he decided to 
build a kingdom.

Julia woke up abruptly. Nothing seemed to have startled her awake, which made the sensation 
rather alien: usually it takes at least a short while for a mind to fully transition from sleep to waking. For 
some this period lasts hours or is only terminated with stimulants.  Not so here. She seemed to have 
gone from complete oblivion to full consciousness in a moment. It was as if a switch had been thrown. 
She discovered that she’d been sleeping face down. Activity was audible all around her and she 

5

sought to rise but found herself unable to for reasons which, though you’ve anticipated, it took her 
some moments to work out. The process of finding the impediment and then painstakingly extricating 
her new bosoms from the bed beneath her provided all the priming necessary for the events of the 
previous day to replay before her mind. When she finally did succeed in rising, she at least knew, for the 
first time in a while, what room she would find herself in. 

The bunk room was astir with activity. It seemed that everyone had woken up at about the same 
time, as all over the square of beds women were rising and stretching. Some had already risen and were 
walking about, finding one another, or heading into an adjoining room through a wide arch Julia hadn’t 
remarked the night before. Her head was much clearer than the last time she’d awoken here. In the 
midst of so many strangers she was suddenly acutely aware of her bare and ludicrously distended chest. 
She had no experience being naked in large groups, even shared changing rooms were something she’d 
mostly avoided after high-school, and though nobody seemed especially interested it was hard not to 
feel that her new chest stood out like a pair of fleshy beacons.  

She looked around for her comforter of the night before, the only familiar element of this whole 

ordeal. She turned out to be quite close talking to a redhead a few beds down. Julia slid down from her 
bunk and found herself sprawled on the floor. She’d neglected the greatly increased mass before her. 
(Her new center of gravity would remain an irritant for cycles to come. Very seldom would she actually 
fall, but any movement she undertook without being adequately deliberate risked her losing her balance 
just slightly and having to throw out her arms or stagger. That her ability to comfortably walk in her own 
body had been taken from her proved a lasting insult to her dignity.) Gingerly Julia raised herself again 
only to find that Jacky and her redheaded companion had walked over to her and each now offered her 
a helping hand. 

“This is Julie.” Jacky said to her friend. 
“Julia, actually.” Julia timidly correctly. 
“Julia, right, sorry. This ‘ll be her first cycle.” 
The redhead looked Julia up and down. She had a sharp chin and angular features. Her hair, too 

deep a red to be her original shade, was buzzed to a short stubble. This combined with thick eyebrows 
to make her rather intimidating. “Hi. I’m Torch.” She said in a somewhat husky voice.  

“Here, we’d better get her into the assembly room.” Jacky said to torch, then, to Julia, “Come 
on, honey, we all have to wait in there after waking up. It’s your first day so they’d cut you some slack, 
but it’s better if you just do what they want.” 

“Do we need to help you walk?” Queried Torch. 
“I think I’m alright.” Julia replied and followed the pair to the end of the room. There she found 
herself in a further room, quite similar to the one she’d just left but devoid of furniture. Two other walls 
were punctuated by wide entrances like the one she’d just come through, while on the forth stood a row 
of institutional looking doors with vertical bars in front of them. Most of the floor here was hardwood, 
just like in the bunk room, but a strip of space nearest the doors was smooth blue-grey, like the walls

and separated from the rest by a vivid red stripe. There were a number of women milling about the 
room already, and more were filing in from the bunk room all the time. 

“Now,” Jacky began in an earnest tone, “we wait here for them to come get us. When they call 
your name, march right over to whoever said it and go with them. Don’t fight them or anything,” at this 
Torch snorted softly to herself, “and whatever you do don’t run off, just go where they take you. Until 
they call your name, though, just wait here. Stay away from the doors. Don’t cross that red line until you 
hear your name.” 

For a moment Julia had so many pressing questions in her head that it was difficult to actually 

verbalize any one of them. Finally several burst out at once in a frightened jumble, “When who comes to 
take me where? What’s

? What is this?” 

“Ok, try and keep calm, Julie, I mean Julia. Damnit. Sorry, I knew a Julie.” Jacky didn’t actually 
sound overly upset. “First, some tenders are going to come get you. You know those guys in the blue 
and red uniforms?”

Julia nodded. 
“Those guys are “tenders.” They tell us what do, where to go, and make sure we do it—like our

“Or zoo keepers.” Torch offered. 
“They are going to take you somewhere—to your assignment, the job they want you doing 

“What’s my assignment?” 
“Don’t know.” Torch spoke this time. “There all sorts of reasons they might give you those.” She 

gestured at Julia’s breasts, which Julia was doing her best to fold her arms across.  

“But you aren’t being punished or anything yet, it’s your first day, so it shouldn’t be too bad.” 

Jacky reassured. “They save the really bad stuff for people who piss them off. That’s why I’m telling you 
to cooperate with them. If you don’t, you get reassigned.” Jacky had been talking rather quickly this 
whole time, as if rushed. As she did, the room had rapidly filled up until the entire content of the bunk 
room stood there waiting.

One of the doors had opened, and two tenders stood on the far side of the red line. The room hushed, 
voices went quiet and women stopped milling as all attended to the doors. A blonde, Gwendoline 
apparently, trotted over to the two men who lead her out through the door they’d come through. The 
bars dropped back into place behind them with a swish. Something occurred to Julia as she looked at 
what must be nearly two hundred women around her.

“How will I be sure I’m the Julia they’re calling?” she whispered. 
“You’re the only Julia here.” Responded Jacky under her breath, “They’re insanely organized. 

Now sshhh.” She gestured for Julia to face the front of the room. 

One by one women were called by pairs of tenders who entered through any of the several 

doors. Often several sets would enter on each other’s heels and names would be called quite rapidly. 
Julia did not have to wait long to hear her name. She was within the first thirty names called. For a 
moment she was rooted in place. From behind Torch gave her a light shove. “Go!” she mouthed. Face 
burning, and looking down at the floor, or more accurately at her own chest, she marched over to where 
the two uniformed men stood. Quickly one waved a device by her right ear which beeped faintly. Then 
they took her by either elbow and lead her out of the room.

Obviously the human mind can shape the stuff of the Somnole forming it into forms and 
structures. Most nights it does so without meaning to, casting a shadow of its own inner workings onto 
dreaming space. But, like shadows, these constructs are constantly changing and short lived. And they 
only exist in proximity to the mind that cast them. 

A mind with a strong will can do something similar deliberately in the depths of the Somnole. 
But this takes technique and great effort and will nonetheless be evanescent and unstable. One could 
build a tower, but it would fade like mist or, more troublingly to most, take on aspects of a serpent in a 
fairly short amount of time. To this problem the future Adan now turned his attention. If he was to 
colonize the depths then he must find a way to build things that would last. 

As he ventured out into the dark he did discover some lasting structures already there, the 

sediment, it seemed, of the collective unconscious of the human race settling in drifts and formations. 
These tended to be surreal and difficult to fathom or process, like the cyclopean works of some primal 
absurdist. They were useless for permanent construction. Disrupted, they would reform. And pondering 
their form for very long had a disquieting effect on a lucid mind. 

The Somnole seemed in constant motion. But there were ways to work with this flow, forms 

that would endure in it. A river may erode a bank, but it also may dredge up its bottom to keep a 
sandbar in existence. So, if one could find forms which were sustained rather than eroded, then perhaps 
one could impose lasting structure.  

Of course, this too is a metaphor. Metaphors are all but unavoidable when you are dealing with 

a realm that is not inherently spatially arrayed, and which is animated by forces which have no direct 
analogue in physics. Talk of “forms which were sustained” might give the idea of looking for shapes 
which will sustain forces, like a terrestrial engineer. But isn’t right. The forms that were called for would 
be more aptly compared to things like archetypes and motifs in stories. 

And progress was made along these lines. He began to formulate a cannon of principles that 

allowed a form to “satisfy” the Somnole, keeping it from so easily distorting or slipping away. For 
instance, it was easier to give an object a property if it resembled an object the human mind expects to 
be united with that property. Somewhat subtler were principles like balance, unfolding, and desert. 
Much of what he found is still taught to shapers with only slight amendment. 

It was at this point that he seems to have first sought collaborators in his labor. Here many 

patterns were established that would long persist: instead of turning to others he was acquainted with 
in the waking world, Adan found and initiated his collaborators through their dreams. His vision was 
contagious, and soon a handful of others were diligently laboring alongside him. It was also here that 
the practice originated of taking somnolent names different from those used in waking, and here also 
that the name Adan was first employed. Soon, with so many laboring together and the principles 
needed to bend dreams to their will beginning to reveal themselves, the foundations were laid for the 
first version of the city. 

Their construction would go on for years, though now little record remains of this dead 

predecessor to the City. It was grand in its day, its citadels and streets populated only by the few 
handpicked companions who labored alongside the visionary Adan. All else in the city was mere 
simulacra. And though they’d had great success, and new insights were yielded every day, the ability to 
establish things with true permanence did not precipitate. At the edges, the first City was fraying even 
during its brief zenith.  

Adan concluded that had been fundamentally misguided and that he must start again. The 

insight this second version of the city would be based on was this: mere passive endurance would never 
provide what was needed. Passivity did not truly endure, only activity could truly abide. To form a 
bastion of solidity in the depths would require an active power that would constantly reestablished what 
had been created, a model less like a castle of dead stone, and more like an organism of tissues through 
which blood coursed. 

So Adan and the first circle of archons let their first labor decompose around them, first into a 

haunted place, then a mere echo. They devoted their energies to discovering their active power.

Julia found herself being lead at a rather rapid pace down a maze-like series of halls. There were 

turns, and intersections, doors, and at one point a round elevator that rushed upwards with complete 
smoothness. She had toured a power plant once, years ago, and these endless, windowless corridors 
reminded her of it. The passages looked almost identical save for markings on the walls which seemed 
to be signposts of some sort but in an alphabet Julia could not decipher. All the passages had round 
ceilings in the same grey as the walls. The floor was a very faint cucumber green. It felt cool and just 
slightly yielding underfoot. Very quickly it all became a blur. 

The thought of running off down a side passage did occur to her, of course, an inevitable upshot 

of her dread of what lay before her. But it wasn’t workable. The men on either side of her were 
muscular and had firm hold of her arms. Even if she broke free, they passed others walking the halls with 
and without women in tow regularly. And Jacky’s words rang in her ears, “whatever you do don’t run 
off, just go where they take you.” So instead she asked the two men, pleadingly, “Where are you taking 
me?” 

“To your assignment,” the one on the left answered curtly.  
Finally her escorts turned down a hall noticeably unlike the others. Down one wall was a row of 
smaller doors that looked as if they were made from planks. They looked old and thus starkly discordant 
with their surroundings. Her escort opening one of these she was shuffled into a dim space beyond, 
almost a booth. The only light seemed to come from an opening high on the wall before her. Illuminated 
by its beam she could see an apparatus of straps and bars on the floor. Exercise equipment perhaps?  
Onto this device, whatever it was, she was curtly maneuvered. “Step there.” She stood where 
they directed her, and the men set to work. In the semi-dark various elements were moved into place 
around her. She could feel pads of some sort in front of her knees, and something like a metal sleeve 
was pushed in snug over each arm.  “What is this? What are you doing?” she demanded. But the only 
response was a “Hush.” from one of her tenders. She instinctively tried to get free of whatever was 
holding her and found that her body was now held fast in its upright position. 

At least, it was upright for a moment. Having installed her to their satisfaction the tenders began 

to turn a crank. As they did Julia began to tip forward and at the same time bodily rise forward towards 
the gap in the wall. Soon her head poked through, then her entire torso. Finally, with a clunk, the 
movement stopped as the plate which held her fixed below the naval made contact with the edge of the 
opening and her movement ceased. 

After the dimness it took a moment for Julia’s eyes to adjust to the brighter room her front half 
now occupied. The scene that met her eyes was a surreal one. In front of her was a rather old-fashioned 
looking pub, almost faux medieval, the sort of thing that might really exist in an English village and was 
likely kitsch anyplace else. There was a bar, and rough, round wooden tables surrounded by chairs. Over 

the bar hung a hand painted sign that read, “The Generous Cow” in gothic lettering. But what made the 
scene so surprising was that at intervals along the wall facing her (and indeed, along three of the room’s 
four walls), the busts of naked women protruded at regular intervals, like the bawdy figureheads of 
great old ships. Each woman had enormous breasts which, due to their angle, danged freely bellow her. 
Her arms from the shoulder down were covered by matte metal sleeves giving almost the impression 
that she had none. Beneath each hanging pair of breasts a little shelf extended from the wall. The 
women were mounted high up, so that their cleavage would be at about eye level for somebody 
standing on the floor below. And, of course, this was Julia’s own position as well. She was part of an 
identical row of women running along her side of the room. Craning her neck as much as the brace 
holding her in place would allow, she could catch sight of the woman to either side. 

There were several people on the floor below apparently getting things set up: arranging the 

chairs, laying out mugs and coasters, and one thin fellow with a mustache moving from woman to 
woman with a small step ladder and a little gun-like device. Turning to the woman on her right as best 
she could, Julia quietly asked, “What is all this? Where are we?” 

The woman she was addressing looked like something out of a sixties advertisement. Her hair 
was a blonde bouffant. Her breasts tapered to points reminiscent of bullet bras of the era, only instead 
of bullets these were clearly a pair of torpedoes. The woman inclined her head slightly and whispered 
back, “You’re new?” 

“Yes,” Julia mirrored the woman’s whisper. 
“We’re the cows in the ‘Generous Cow’.” 
“What?” 
“We’re the cows, the ones that get milked. Now quiet, he’ll hear us.” Apparently she meant the 

slender man with the step ladder. 

Indeed he had heard something. He looked up at them with an ironic smile and said, “You cows 
had better quiet down. I don’t want you heifers passing gossip about our customers.” His voice was a bit 
high and sing-songy. He drew his ladder up beneath Julia and climbed a few steps up. “Ah, a new ‘face’ I 
see.” He said impishly, staring at her breasts. “Are you ready for a day of fun?”  

Julia said nothing. 
“Well, who can complain when a cow keeps her own council? We’ll just set you up then...” He 

lifted the gun-like apparatus. Up close it looked a bit like a hot glue gun. He pulled a cylinder full of taupe 
liquid from a pouch in his apron and plugged it into the back end of the device. Pressing the front end up 
to the top of Julia’s right breast, almost at the armpit, there was a click and Julia felt a sharp sensation. A 
moment later he popped the empty cylinder back out of his device. Clearly she’d been injected with 
something. “There you go little Julia moo. Aren’t you just in for a fun time.” Still smirking he moved on 
to the sixties woman on the right. 

Julia almost inadvertently again began struggling and straining against the bonds keeping her in 
place. Some assiduously placed bits of padding made her confinement bearable when she was still, but 
beneath they were solid metal and didn’t budge an inch. Parts of her were actually free: everything 
bellow her waist was just sort of propped in place. Her knees rested fairly comfortably in a sort of stirrup 
but nothing bound them there. Her hands were free to clench and unclench at her sides, but couldn’t 
get hold of anything. She writhed and wriggled, and still she was immovably mounted on the wall. 

As she struggled, though, her chest began to feel oddly. She began to feel a slight warmth and 
diffuse pressure. Soon the heat intensified and the pressure became more localized towards the end of 
her breasts. Her nipples began to tingle and then ache. Soon her entire chest felt as if it were even 
heavier than it had previously been, swollen with some internal weight. 

“I’m sorry.” the woman on the right whispered. “I didn’t mean anything. It’s just that we’re 

supposed to be quiet while we’re up on the wall. They might punish us if we’re too loud. I’m Maryanne.” 

“What did they put in me?” Julia squeaked. 
“I don’t know what it is,” came the whispered response, “just what it does. Do you have that 

awful inflating balloon feeling in your tits?” 

“Yes.” 
“That’s because they’re producing milk.” 
“Milk!” Julia barely restrained a shriek. 
“Shhhhh. Stop yelling.” Maryanne sounded a bit panicked.  
“But
why milk?” Julia pleaded pitifully. 
“Shhhh. Like I said, we’re the cows. They’re going to
“Now, now!” It was the fellow with the step ladder again. “I thought I told you cows no 
gossiping. Julia is new and doesn’t know any better but Maryanne, I’m surprised at you. He strolled over 
towards Maryanne, who looked pained.

fix.” Climbing up the step ladder again he emptied another canister into the wincing blonde. “There, 
now you’ll have something better to do rather than be a chatty Cathy.” He trotted away. 
As soon as he was out of earshot Julia whispered, “What happened? Did he

piled high on her head. Whether because of what had just transpired or for some other reason, this 
stately individual would not acknowledge Julia in any way. So Julia had to simply wait like a dear on a 
trophy wall to see what happened.

You would think someone a fool if they told you that sex is a powerful psychological force as if 

that were news. Freud saw it everywhere, an animating force that takes many forms. But older thinkers, 
moralists and libertines alike, had been quite as aware how deeply its roots went. The insight that Adan 
had was somewhat different though: his insight was that human sexuality might here, in the realm then 
called Somnolence, later just “the Somnole”, be a force one could harness to shape things, the electricity 
of his City. 

This is not to say that sexuality had been entirely divorced from the work of him and his friends 
up to that point. Who would set about building a dream city and not seek to see their dreams fulfilled? 
So erotic fantasy couldn’t help but enter into their shaping. But to now this had been a matter of 
artifice: simulacra were constructed to cater to individual whims, servants made in the same way as 
walls and windows and from the same stuff. This meant that they faded in the same way. Though they 
had a tendency to linger, at least in part, longer than one would expect. 

But what if real sexual scenarios, real in that men actually interacted with women, were 
introduced? The sexual bond between men and women must surely be on the same level as things like 

the principle of balance or of ordinacy. Had not sexuality been an engine of human evolution, and 
therefore likely imbedded deeper into the stuff of thought than almost anything? 

Experiments were conducted. The galvanic potential of man and woman’s uniting was 
immediately apparent, but tapping it would take work. How was the potential of human sexuality to be 
harnessed? Like magicians binding a spirit, the right incantation had to be found if the power was to be 
of any real use. 

Out of this effort a new plan began to emerge: a new City, coursing with refined sexual energy. 

They dubbed it simply “urge”. Their construction would no longer be established solely by will, rather 
the will of the Shapers would direct a primal intensity which would carve the Somnole with ease. Once 
the framework were laid and the dynamo harnessed they could build what they wanted—and enjoy the 
6
dynamo for its intrinsic qualities at the same time.  This was the project, and they embarked on its 
realization with vigor. 

But how to generate the needed urge? A handful of men perusing their own pleasures would 

never be enough, even if they allowed themselves to be entirely preoccupied by sensuality—an 
intention none of them had. They’d need to come up with something more.

Julia, had been staring around the room in unbearable suspense for what seemed like hours. 

The other women mostly seemed to be waiting in dejected silence, though Julia noticed that sometimes 
when backs were turned pairs of heads did lean in furtively to exchange a few words. She earnestly 
wished she could hear the words being said. Her own neighbors remained silent, save that Maryanne 
periodically emitted low moans under her breath. 

The heated feeling inside her chest had cooled, but the bloating pressure and soreness had only 
intensified. Indeed, Julia felt disconcertingly as if her chest might have swollen beyond even its existing 
lewd dimensions. Glancing over at Maryanne’s torpedo tits she felt she could actually see a change in 
size, and the woman’s veins stood out sharply in a way Julia didn’t think they had before. It was quite 
natural to reach a hand down to massage her aggrieved flesh, and she repeatedly began this gesture 
only to be jarringly reminded that her arms were strictly confined. This was an entirely alien experience 
for her, and there was something almost panic inducing about not being able to reach her own chest. 
She kept trying to push out of her mind the question of what would happen if she began to itch. It was 
trivial compared to her other worries, yet hard not to visualize once it occurred to her. 

At a certain point the set up in the 

 seemed to be completed. Staff stopped

​

bustling about and retreated behind the bar. A bell was struck, and Julia sensed a collective wince from 
the wall-mounted women. Any furtive conversation ceased. Stillness blanketed the room. It was as if the 
whole place was holding its breath. The stillness was broken perhaps two minutes later as the door 
opposite the bar swung open and two men strolled in chatting. They were not tenders and, it occurred 
to her, had a bit more gut than she’d yet seen on any of the uniformed men. They were just the sort of 
guys one might find at any run-of-the-mill American bar talking about football. They proceeded over to 
the bar where large coins were exchanged for mugs—but empty mugs, oddly. Turning from the bar they 
sidled over towards the far wall and walked beneath the row of women. 

Julia watched what happened next transfixed in horror. Perhaps she’d had some inkling of what 

might follow that she’d simply refused to acknowledge, perhaps not, but what transpired sent chills 

6 Another added benefit was that the mental projections of actual people were one of the most durable things 
they’d yet discovered. This was one of many reasons to prefer a dreaming woman to a dream of a woman.  

​
through her. The two men stopped in front of a redhead whose freckles extended beyond the areas 
normally exposed to sunlight. Still chatting they set their mugs on the little shelf beneath her. Then, 
without preamble, each man reached up and grabbed one of the redhead’s great, round boobs and 
squeezed. The redhead’s face contorted as the two tugged at her defenseless chest. White streams 
spurted from her nipples and into the waiting mugs. Julia’s own chest convulsed in sympathy. The two 
sets of hands continued milking the woman’s breasts, squeezing and pulling relentlessly as Julia winced 
and cringed. Finally, mugs filled, they released her tender organs and took seats nearby to sip their 
drinks. 

As if released from a spell Julia began to struggle madly against the confines of the sheath that 

held her. The door at the front of the tavern opened again. Another patron walked in.
