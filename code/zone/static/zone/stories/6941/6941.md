**True love only grows II**The sound as Britney clicked on the left mouse button was soft and could only be heard for a split second. In her ears however it echoed like a bursting thunder. Letting go of the mouse she raised her hand, putting it on the side of her bosom. Her eyes fixed on the blue bar she eagerly stared at the screen, softly stroking the wide flanks of her bust. The surface of her palms scratched over the jagged rim of the tears, rubbing the fabric faster and harder the longer she waited for her meaty mounds to swell against her palms. As nothing happened for several seconds however she slowed down her caressing, while the corners of her mouth were drop](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/True-love-only-grows-II-361650515)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**True love only grows I**Tap. Tap. Tap.  
  
Again and again a foot was stepping on the ground. In a simple rhythm Britney tapped on the carpet of her husband�s office. From time to time a small click accompanied the tapping as Britney was biting on the nail of her thumb her teeth, chopping off small pieces in an irregular pattern. The bitter taste of the red nail lacquer rubbed off, on her tongue, only a very slight amount, but enough for her to take her thumb out of her mouth after a while and put it on her chin instead. Eventually she started tapping on her chin as well, offbeat to her feet. It wasn�t because she was impatient that she was tapping, and she](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/True-love-only-grows-I-360919581)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**The genie from the milk bottle 2**There it was, hanging from Amanda's chest: A pair of smooth breasts, shaped into such a perfectly spherical form it looked like someone had molded them in meticulous detail work. Despite the firmness that made them stick out proudly from the body attached to them their flesh gave slightly in to the hands that wandered over them. Softly the tender meat was caressed as the fingers wandered from the fabric on the flanks to the skin revealed in the cleavage, kneading the breasts like a baker his dough. Amanda rubbed her palms over her sensitive mounds, wondering how large they were. Grapefruits? Cantaloupes? It was something in between that was s](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/The-genie-from-the-milk-bottle-2-311517078)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Fairy Tail SlumBEr party I**The last rays of the sun poked out beyond the horizon, in the form of a very light orange gleam on the water. It was safe to say night had fallen over Magnolia town as stars were already shining brightly in the sky, with no clouds blocking the sight. Slowly the leftover light faded into the sea, giving way for the last remnants of the night to fall over the sky. The first building being completely left by the sun�s light was the one standing on a hill just at the edge of the town: The women�s dorm of the number one guild of the city, Fairy Tail�s Fairy Hills.    
  
In the lounge on the second floor one could see the curvy shade](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Fairy-Tail-SlumBEr-party-I-349300663)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Fairy Tail SlumBEr party II**In the time Erza, Cana and Mira were busy teasing Lucy Lisanna was put in growing awe by her growing buttocks and breasts. Slowly but steadily the �humble� mounds on her front reached up to the size her friends had before the growth spurt, filling out and stretching her pajama quite nicely around them. Embracing them with her hands the sexy curves of her bosom softly vaulted into her palms, pushing her fingers along their steadily rounder form. As the bulk of her breasts increased her hands bent around them while at the same time the flesh got squeezed slightly in her grip. Her top creaked even louder as the fabric threw wrinkles](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Fairy-Tail-SlumBEr-party-II-355460794) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Wendy's Wish**Wendy looked in awe at her reflection in the mirror. Instead of the small girl she was used to see she looked at the image of a grown-up teenager, being around the same age and height as the other girls in the guild. Her hair, tied with red ribbons into two pigtails was smooth and voluminous, while her face had lost its childish appearance and had taken on a somewhat mysterious, and what was more important very beautiful expression. Her dark blue socks that went up to her knees rested smoothly on her long and sleek legs, a pair of plump and juicy thighs looking out above, barely covered by her pleated grey mini-skirt. Hugging her cute bubble](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Wendy-s-Wish-356926597) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Erza's (treasure) chest**The rays of the morning sun shined into an ancient temple ruin on top of a large mountain. Its architecture resembled buildings of the antique Greece, completely made out of white stone with round pillars and a triangular roof. There were no walls in the small sanctuary, but only pillars holding the roof. Through them the light streamed into the only room, a large hall with a polished floor. At the end of the hall a small altar was located, carrying a comparatively large treasure chest. Despite the early hour and being abandoned for centuries the temple was crowded, though only one of them was standing on her feet: In the middle of the hall a](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Erza-s-treasure-chest-380324760)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Rackrolled**Robert couldn�t believe his eyes as he stared at the giant mounds his girlfriend presented to him. �Wow�, was all he brought as he gazed at their firm curves, dropping his jaw at their unholy size. �I haven�t ever seen something so� huge before.�  
  
Rebecca felt slightly embarrassed by her boyfriend�s praise, especially when he reached out and touched them. �So... you like them?�, she asked sheepishly.  
  
Slowly Robert stroked them, feeling their enormousness with his own hands. �Like them? I LOVE them!�, he replied, grinning from ear to ear. In the gentlest manner he ran th](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Rackrolled-362839920)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Mammary Mentality**�Doctor, I�m obsessed with boobs!�  
  
Through her rectangular glasses Quinn looked up from her notepad to the man lying on the red couch in front of her. Sitting on her office chair her legs were crossed, partly out of habit, partly so her patient couldn�t peek under her knee-long grey skirt that lay tightly around her thighs and hips. Dark nylon thighs covered her smooth legs, and she wore black high-heels on her small feet. �It is true that during our little sessions you have revealed several aspects of your personality hold a particular interest in the exclusive charm of a woman�s body, especially when the](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Mammary-Mentality-337778591)

**150K Celebration (Part 2)**When Raven and Amy found Ms. Emmet, the teacher was coming out of the faculty lounge. The two quickly ran up to her, Raven trailing behind, not used to the new weight of her breasts yet. With each step she made, the bouncing of her chest caused her to stumble forward a bit, each boob undulating up and down like an office ball clacker. Amy waved to get Ms. Emmet�s attention before stopping in front of her, surprised by how she didn�t feel a bit exhausted. Raven�s stop was much less graceful, in that the momentum of her bosom finally caused her to fall to the floor, providing Amy with a nice view of skull-covered panties befor](http://bioyugi.deviantart.com/art/150K-Celebration-Part-2-348019824)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**150K Celebration Part 8**150K Celebration Part 8  
  
Aria held her massive foot looming in the air, threatening to bring it crashing down on the big boobed 20 ft tall giantess, and pink haired cheerleader recently turned bimbo.  
  
"NO! STOP DON'T HURT THEM!" Aria shouted, strangely though in a slightly higher pitched voice than she originally greeted the group of school girls and cat like teacher with earlier.  
  
"Grrr... Yer a freakin annoyance... Why are ya still tryin ta interfere? This is what ya wished for!" Aria shouted in her previous tone, seemingly having an argument with herself.

**150k celebration part 9**150k celebration part 9  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Should someone have happened to walk into the towns local forest that day, they would have seen a strange sight.  
  
A line of the most unusual people. At their head was a pale haired girl whose clothes appeared to be made from leaves and twigs, and she was arguing with herself in strange voices. Following her was a cat-woman with multiple hanging breasts and a large voluptuous belly walking on all fours. Next was a black haired girl with titanic breasts, however they were constantly leaking a small yet steady stream of milk. And after he](http://babermirza.deviantart.com/art/150k-celebration-part-9-378689441)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Double Vision**Double Vision  
  
Carmen Rivera stepped through the threshold of her new house, hanging her expensive designer purse on a rack beside the door. It was an old house, but it was all she could afford anywhere near her prospective workplace. One day, though, her modeling career would get her all the money she needed for her dream home in Beverly Hills. This house was just a temporary investment. She couldn�t believe she got the house so cheap. The realtor practically gave it to her, throwing it away like a rotten banana peel. The place certainly wasn�t garbage, though. The home was cleaned up so well that one would never know it was vacant](http://xphoenixflare.deviantart.com/art/Double-Vision-382185929)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**The Egg Hunt**The Egg Hunt  
  
For a professional place of business, this was probably the strangest thing I had ever heard of. Sure, being forced to work on Easter wasn�t really that unusual, despite the total lack of necessity for my line of work. Why did a cosmetic company need to hire testers when they had plenty of workers to test on? Of all the things we could have been doing, though, they scheduled an Easter egg hunt. It wasn�t even for our kids, but for us. What self-respecting sophisticate would want to search for plastic eggs?  
  
My coworkers and I gathered in our boss�s office. Standing beside me was the new girl Liz, who was barely ev](http://xphoenixflare.deviantart.com/art/The-Egg-Hunt-362782248)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Expansion Churros: Part Two**Expansion Churros  
Part Two: Sabrina's Breast Expansion  
  
As Sabrina's bra tightened, her cleavage began to swell out from her v-neck. Sabrina was without a doubt the most voluptuous friend we knew, and Kylie and Katrina got excited as they looked on.  
  
�You know, this is going to be awesome!� Kylie exclaimed. �Sabrina already has D's, so imagine how big her boobs will get! Hehe! Clever idea with the expanding churros idea, Katrina!�  
  
Kylie's compliment brought a smile to Katrina's face, �Yes, thank you. I-�  
  
�HEY! How about you un-freeze me, Katrina! I'm tired of being in this position](http://blueberryjanelle.deviantart.com/art/Expansion-Churros-Part-Two-376605645)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Sarah's revenge (part 1)**DOUBLE DOUBLE, TOIL AND...  
  
After many painstaking and tedious preparations, she was finally ready. The charm she'd made had been placed. The recipe for the bubbling concoction contained within the black cauldron before her was nearing completion. All that was left to do was read out her paragraph of choice from the tattered book of spells which she held tightly in her hand.  
  
The old spell book was one of the only things Sarah picked up from her neighbour's yard sale. Going for only $5, she thought why not? Besides, she had the perfect idea for the first spell and the perfect idea for who to cast it on. Lydia Fletcher.  
  
Lydia was the typical](http://nairny.deviantart.com/art/Sarah-s-revenge-part-1-349988434) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Sarah's revenge (part 2)**FIRST DATE  
  
Lydia hadn't been on a date in a while, she had become more used to one night stands. However, she thought she would try something slightly more sophisticated this time, just for a change of pace. Her perfect opportunity presented itself when Rob, her neighbour, offered to take her to one of the most prestigious restaurants in the city, 'L'etat calot'. Obviously, it specialised in French food, but Lydia didn't really like the idea of 'eating icky frogs legs', as she put it.  
  
Rob was amazed when Lydia said yes to going out with him; He had been building up the confidence to ask her for weeks. He was driving her to the restaurant, s](http://nairny.deviantart.com/art/Sarah-s-revenge-part-2-350543918)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)

 �Oh, I�m so late!�, Li panted as she ran down the street. Her red-orange hoodie bopped slightly as she rushed to school, the baggy hem bumping against her jeans shorts. Beneath her hoodie she wore a plain white T-shirt, a small part of it visible since the zipper wasn�t fully pulled up. Without checking left and right Li leapt on the wide main street. �Why did I promise mom to take the early shift in the store on a weekday?�, she mourned to herself, basically jumping over the asphalt towards the school gate on the other side. �I mean she�s sick, but I still need to go to school! And why did I miss the bus? Or only realised on half the way I could have taken the bike? Or stopped to pick up that stone?� At this thought she clenched her fingers tighter around the little blue gem in her fist. �Or got lost twice on the way even though I�ve walked it a hundred times already before? Or��  
  
Still on the street the Chinese girl suddenly stopped. From around the school gate a group of male students a grade above her appeared. They wore black leather jackets and had spiky hair dyed in aggressive colours, completely opposite to her long black hair she had tied into a pony-tail. Their appearance and their devious grins made Li slowly turn around. She was about to run away when car horn startled her. Immediately she leapt on the side-walk, just in time to evade a red Ferrari that clearly busted the speed limit. Feeling her heartbeat in her throat she stumbled forward, needing a few steps to calm down and catch her balance. When her feet stopped she found herself right in the middle of the older students, their smirks making her heart beat even faster.  
  
One of the boys stepped forward, positioning himself right in front of Li. �Hey there, cutie!�, he greeted her. He towered at least a full head over the short 18-year old. The shy girl gulped, wrapping her arms tighter around her school bag while taking a step back. �Now what does such a pretty face want at a boring place like this?�, the guy wondered aloud, following the slowly retreating girl. Walking backwards she didn�t notice one of the others placed himself behind her. As she bumped with her back against him she shrieked like a mouse, causing the boys around her to laugh. Grinning even wider the one in front of Li approached her until he almost stood on her toes. �Why don�t you skip school and come with us, to do something more� interesting?� He leaned his body towards her until their noses almost touched each other. Unable to escape Li stared anxiously into his green eyes, seeing the reflection of her own face in it. Her whole boy shivered, her fist clenching the stone so tight she was afraid it would break as the guy slowly raised his hand to the side of her body.   
  
Before he could touch her however Li heard a loud �BANG�. Screaming in pain he stepped away from her, putting a hand on his forehead. The one behind Li also stepped aside, allowing Li to quickly retreat a few steps to the back. Standing on the border of the sidewalk she saw a can flying through the air in a wide bow as if it had bumped off something. It didn�t take long for her to conclude it had bumped off the guy�s head � especially once she saw a certain girl a few meters to the right of her with her arm stretched out.  
  
�Leave her alone, jerks!�, Claire barked at the group of boys, putting her hands on her hips. Furiously furrowing her bows her grey eyes glared at the gang, the boys slowly distancing themselves from Li at the sight of her. A smooth shine was on her fire-red mane, the strands only a bit longer at the front where they covered her forehead with a few tips hanging in front of her eyes. On her slender but athletic body she wore a camouflage-tank-top in light green, while the pattern of her wide trousers was a shade darker. The can she had thrown landed on the sidewalk, rolling over the pavement towards the tanned girl�s feet. Before it bumped against her toes she crushed it under her boot. �And if you know what�s good for ya, you better get back to your class before things get REALLY ugly!�, she declared.  
  
The guy hit by the can glanced furiously at Claire. �Ow, you bitch!�, he shouted. �Ya think I�ll let this go? Y�are gonna pay for thi-�   
  
Two of the other boys suddenly grabbed his arms, one putting a hand over his mouth. �Shut up, idiot!�, the other one snarled at him, and both began to pull him away. �That girl means trouble! Let�s just get lost before she gets angry!� The rest of the group also grabbed their leader, trying to drag him away. Eventually he gave in, and the gang quickly ran across the street. Walking up to Li Claire looked after them with a disapproving glance.  
  
�These slackers do nothing but skip school and cause trouble�, she said, shaking her head as they vanished behind a corner. �A few years of military academy would do �em good!�  
  
Li panted heavily, only slowly digesting the shock. Her firm firsts opened, revealing the little blue stone in her hand, while the grip of her arms on her school bag loosened. She looked up to the tall girl in front of her. �Thank you Claire!�, she said, smiling brightly at her saviour. �I-I don�t what would have happened if-�  
  
The finger of the ginger suddenly swept through her sight, cutting her off. �Give me that stone!�, Claire demanded, pointing at the blue pebble in Li�s hand.  
  
At first Li looked a little confused. �What? Oh, o-of course!�, she quickly replied, and dropped the stone into Claire�s palm. �I-I�m surprised! I didn�t know you were into girly stuff like-�  
  
�It�s not girly stuff!�, Claire cut her off again, startling the one year younger student. �These stones are extra-terrestrial material and as such property of the government!� She pulled her backpack off her shoulder and opened it. Holding it to Li the Chinese girl could see it was full of similar blue stones, filling out most of the space between her books and notebooks. �I�ve had to confiscate god-knows how much of those damn things today already�, she grumbled, shouldering her backpack again. Without looking at Li she passed through the gates of the school, playfully throwing the pebble into the air and catching it again as she walked towards the building entrance. The short girl quickly followed her. �It�s like every girl in town picked up at least one of those stones and put them in their hair, used them as a necklace or whatever!� Harshly she kicked the school door open, entering the long entrance corridor. Li just barely made it through the door before it closed again, having trouble to keep up with Claire�s pace. �And because I had to lecture EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM fragments of shooting stars aren�t some froufrou decoration for hair I am just as terribly late as you are! Did your mother convince you to take the early shift, or did you get lost on the way � AGAIN?�   
  
Li blushed. �A-actually, both�, she mumbled shyly, wrapping her arms around her bag again.  
  
Claire sighed, throwing the pebble into the air again. Catching it between her thumb and index finger she curiously looked at its blue shine. �But I�ve never seen any stones like those before�, she said as she inspected it. �Who knows, maybe they are really a new sort of mineral from space? Our government might get some useful information if they studied them. I�d go send them off right away, but then I would have to skip school. And skipping school is absolutely unthinkable for a proper student, right?� Li nodded, though she knew this was less a question than a statement from the extremely correct redhead. As the lesson had already started the halls were pretty much deserted, only the two girls walking towards their classrooms. �By the way this was the third time this month I had to fend off some goons for you�, Claire informed Li. �What�s wrong with you, girl? Can�t you stand up for yourself?�  
  
�I-I�m sorry!�, the Chinese girl apologised, covering her red cheeks with her bag.  
  
�Don�t always be so apologetic!�, Claire told her, throwing the stone into her palm and closing her fist around it. �Jeez, I really wished you would grow some boobs.�  
  
Li blushed even deeper. �G-grow some boobs?�, she repeated, raising her school bag a little higher. She then lowered it again however, looking interested at Claire�s closed palm as she saw something shining softly between her fingers. It was only for a split second though before the glimmer disappeared. The curious girl wondered what this was, but before she could really think about it a tingle in her chest caught her attention. Holding her school bag against her bosom she could feel a weak pressure from her body on it, as if she was leaning against the bag. At the same time her little A-cup bra seemed to be rubbing against her small breasts, just like the fabric of the white shirt she wore under her hoodie. Holding her bag in front of her Li looked down on her.  
  
�You know, grow some balls!�, Claire explained her metaphor, not noticing the Chinese girl was thoroughly inspecting her chest. �Toughen up! Be a bit more assertive! And not always be such a pushover!�   
  
While Li looked on her breast the pressure on her brassier increased, just like the sensation of her white shirt slowly sliding across her nimble curves. Though she couldn�t see much through her baggy hoodie she felt as her bosom was surging out from her body, spreading over her chest and vaulting to the sides. The cups of her bra steadily had to hold a larger amount of mass as it tried to flow out of them, steadily lapping over their hard edges. Eventually Li could watch the fabric of her undershirt rising through the neck of her hoodie, and as the bump of her bust began to press against the red-orange fabric its contours subtly began to shine through it. Seeing and feeling her breasts grow Li blinked, at first not realising what was going on. In a short time the plain surface of her chest had swollen so far it reached a rough inch out from her body, slowly filling out the slack in her top while her undershirt and especially her bra grew tight around her prospering roundings. The flanks of her bosom flared out, their outlines bit by bit turning from half-spheres towards a more orbital shape. As the inner halves of her breasts touched, the smooth curves softly rubbing against each other Li�s mouth and eyes gradually opened wider while a slight blush decorated her cheeks. �C-Claire?�, she stuttered.  
  
�Seriously, girls like you should really think of going to a military camp�, the redhead suggested to her friend without turning around. �One or two weeks with some of our toughest men and women will even turn a doormat like you into a resolute young lady!�  
  
As Li continued to follow the rambling Claire her chest kept growing, the little cherries having matured to a pair of ripe grapefruits. With each cubic millimeter they surged outwards the pressure between them increased, their round slopes getting flattened as they squeezed against each other. The cups of her bra were put under rising strain as they tried to contain her meat buns, their bottoms starting to lot out beneath them while the straps were pulled over the sides of her bust. Similarly the knitting of her white shirt stretched over them, lying steadily smoother on her skin. Being wrapped around her bosom the neck of her top was pulled towards her chest, slowly approaching peak of her cleavage. Having conquered most of the space inside it her flesh also started to affect her hoodie more prominently, stealing its looseness and wrinkles while forcing its form on the fabric. As her bust line reached forward and arched out from her body pressure was building up on the zipper. The moment the firm contours were clearly apparent through the vaulted fabric of her hoodies, showing the swelling sides, bottoms and tops of her breasts the little metal piece began to slide down the ascent of her chest, unnoticeably at first. After a while it began to gently press against her bag as the gap between it and her body had been filled out by her bosom. The brassier pinched terribly, being three or four cup-sizes too small, and the fabric of both her tops continued to slide over her curves. The longer Li watched her growth the deeper she blushed, the wider her eyes and mouth opened, and the more worried the look on her face became. �C-C-Claire!�  
  
�I mean it�s not like any girl can be as strong-willed and independent as me�, the redhead went on. �And it�s not like I want you to become a completely different person. But you should really consider doing something about your lack of self-�  
  
Li stopped in the middle of the hallway. Dropping the school she looked horrified down on her bosom, her lips quivering. �CLAIRE!�, she screamed, her voice shrill from panic.  
  
Annoyed Claire turned around. She was about to snarl �What�, but the moment she saw her friend the word got stuck in her throat. Baffled she stared at the lithe Chinese girl, suddenly sporting assets that stuck out from her body as if she had put a pair of small cantaloupes under her shirt. The fabric rested smoothly on them, especially on her shirt in relatively wide excerpt of her hoodie. Dropping her jaw Claire openly stared at Li�s swollen bosom, unable to comprehend how it could have gotten so big. �What the... w-what happened-� She was cut off however by a loud snap, accompanied by shriek from Li. Her bust jiggled slightly, released from the grip of her tight brassier as its lock had broken. Roughly Claire could watch the cups fall from the front of Li�s breasts and slide over the inside of her shirt until they rested at the bottom of her bosom. While she watched the brassier fall from her chest another observation made Claire jump back, and her eyes almost popped out of her head: Li�s lollipops weren�t simply big, they were *growing*! The zipper visibly moved downwards, over the rising globes that spread out through her hoodie, with the sides of the top slowly sliding across the arching curves. �W-what�s happening with you?!�, Claire screamed. Li blushed deeper, instinctively putting her arms around her bosom. In her shock the redhead dropped the stone she still held in her hand. Despite feeling her breasts spread against her arms, their widest parts starting to lap over the sides of her body while the tops approached her chin Li looked at the stone as it landed on the floor. As it hopped over tiles she raised an eye-brow: The blue pebble wasn�t shining as bright anymore, but was actually rather dim. At first she thought the growth was clouding her mind, before the young Chinese suddenly realised what was going on.   
  
�The stone!�, she screeched, Claire taking another step back a she had startled her. Putting one arm off her bust she pointed at the pebble at Claire�s feet, wildly flailing her hand. �Look!�  
  
Claire looked down, seeing the stone had lost its shine. �What the hell-?�  
  
�Your wish!�, Li explained to the confused redhead, jumping up and down in excitement. Her bust jiggled with each of her hops, and she spoke very fast as she continued: �Y-you said I should grow some boobs and � and now I do! Those stones must be magical!� The spheres in her top steadily transcended towards small water melons. Opening her hoodie bit by bit they swelled out of its expanding V-neck, the jags of her zipper scratching over her thin shirt. Their size and shape was even more apparent where only the white fabric covered them, and as they continued to grow steadily more of them escaped from the confines of her hoodie. While the neck of her shirt was pulled so low a slight amount of cleavage looked out, slowly deepening as it was forced further into a teardrop-shape the noise the stretching material made grew louder, indicating it was breaching its limits. �Quick, use one of the other stones and wish me back again!�, Li told Claire, her top getting transparent around her breasts.  
  
It took a moment before Claire frantically shake her head. �B-but that�s ridiculous!�, she argued, wildly gesticulating with her arms. �These are just stones - from space, but still stones! They can�t-�   
  
The redhead was cut off as Li�s white shirt suddenly tore over both her breasts. An oval hole appeared symmetrically near the center of each mound, showing a small amount of their charm. �Just do it!�, the timid girl begged her friend, the Asian skin on her cheeks becoming glaring red as she crossed her arms over her bust to cover the rips with her hands.  
  
Though she couldn�t believe any of what was happening Claire hastily nodded. �O-okay, okay, I�ll do it!�, she quickly replied, putting her backpack off her shoulders. Harshly she opened the zipper, grabbed blindly into it and pulled out a handful of the blue stones. �I� I wish your breasts would return to their normal size!�, she declared, facing her growing friend. One of the pebbles in her palm shined brightly for a second, both girls staring at it before it turned dim. The moment its shine died off they immediately set their eyes on Li�s breasts. They still wrapped the fabric of her tops around it, the vaulting fabric underlining the roundness of their slopes. While she looked at the bosom of her friend Claire suddenly felt a tingle in her butt. �Huh?�, she said, looking a little confused. Slowly her eyes widened as she realised the cheeks of her rear were arching backwards. At first slightly, then steadily more prominently the mass of her ham was spreading behind her, slowly expanding into the slack of her pants. Claire almost dropped the stones and her backpack. Still holding the pebbles she pressed them against her butt as she put her hand on it. Clearly her curves were swelling against the stones, slowly causing her palm to bend as they bulged larger. �What the hell?!�, Claire shouted. �Why is my ass growing!?!� Her tanned cheeks took on a shade matching her fiery mane, the usually unwavering girl feeling embarrassed as her panties and trousers were becoming bit by bit tighter around her butt. Putting her hand off her billowing backside she held the stones in front of her again. �Turn me back, damnit!�, she yelled at them.  
  
Another stone shined brightly for a moment. �EEEH!!!�,  Li suddenly yelped, her bosom jiggling slightly upon her wince.   
  
�What�s wrong?�, Claire asked.  
  
Her arms crossed over her breasts Li felt the pressure created by the swelling flesh was increasing steadily faster. The pace at which her cleavage deepened also accelerated slightly, revealing steadily more of her bosom. Turning semi-sheer around it the white fabric stretched ever louder, eventually ripping on another spot on her right breast. �I-I�M GROWING FASTER!!!�, she screeched, shifting the position of her arm to cover the new hole with her elbow.  
  
�What?! This doesn�t make any sense!!� Hanging the backpack over her elbow Claire formed a bowl with her hands, holding the stones directly in front of her mouth. �Come on, turn us back again!�, she yelled at them, her loud voice echoing through the hallway. It was followed by the echo of a shocked gasp as Claire felt the swells of her posterior reaching against the seat of her pants at a higher speed once another stone had turned dark. Around her bum the trousers began to lose their loose appearance, her cheeks smoothing the camouflage pattern on a rising surface. On the most protruding part of her buttocks the fabric was already rather even, showing the rounding contours of her caboose. Simultaneously her hips reached out to the sides, tightening the waist band in her pants and undergarments. Although it was weakly Claire felt her thighs swelling as well, only slowly, but the space inside her leg pants diminished bit by bit. Her formerly plain butt gradually gained a greater girth, striking enough to make some men turn their heads on the street if Clarie had passed by. �I said back damnit!�, she yelled at the stones again. As another one shined bright Li�s mammaries again surged out faster from her body, pushing the zipper lower and lower. Near the end of her bust it swiftly glided down the leftover descent, while at the same time the sides of her hoodie completely slid off the slopes of her breasts, her grand globes only covered by her form-fitting shirt. Long horizontal tears appeared over her cleavage, looking as if someone had scratched her, while on the top and bottom new smaller holes constantly popped up. The dark skin of the 18-year old Chinese stood in great contrast to the nearly transparent fabric, lying so tight around her bosom one could see every single curve of her perfect spheres. Growing increasingly panicked Claire kept shouting at the stones. �Turn us back!�, she yelled, one stone after another shining and darkening as she screamed in a constantly shriller voice: �Turn us back, turn us back, turnusbackturnusbackturnasba��  
  
�STOP IT CLAIRE!!�, Li screamed. The 19-year-olf redhead stopped, looking in surprise at her friend. Blushing deeply the busty teenager sported breasts larger than her head, swelling rapidly out from her body. She crossed her arms in an awkward way over her chest, trying to cover the holes in her shirt as good as possible. �Y-you�re only making it worse�, she murmured.  
  
Indeed, instead of making it stop the stones had just made either her butt or Li�s breasts grow faster every time she yelled at them. Claire�s fist shook as she clenched it around the stones. �To hell with these!�, she shouted, tossing the stones and her backpack behind her. After she had thrown them away she held her arms out from her body, nervously glancing down her back at her butt. The slopes of her posterior had tightened her pants so far their shape was clearly apparent on the camouflage pattern, every single spot visibly sliding and stretching over them. Her individual cheeks shined gradually greater through her trousers as their imprints were pressed into the seat of her pants. In the middle of her rump the fabric began to form a sink, falling into her butt gap. Not only towards the back, her pants also began to tighten on the sides as her hips continued to match growing frame of her butt, being around an inch wider both left and right than before. While her backside became wider than her shoulders, standing in striking contrast to her slender waist and torso Claire�s thighs started to press noticeable against her trousers. Swelling against the fabric the belt line of her pants slowly slid deeper, and at the same time the pant legs bit by bit revealed more of her boots as her booty wrapped the fabric around it. Claire noticed the increasing bulk of her butt also made her slightly taller, having gained already two centimeters in the time her inconspicuous butt had ballooned to a pair of volleyballs. Despite their huge size however their shape was amazingly crisp and firm, and not sagging in the least. While her rear continued to pull her pants around them Claire also could feel her panties sliding over her curves, the formerly covering underwear lying in a triangle shape over it.  
  
Meanwhile the stout spheres of Li were getting noticeably the largest part of her body. Stretching her shirt into nothingness she could feel the fabric growing weaker by the second. The stitches creaked, the holes widened, everything about the top seemed to shake and vibrate like glass before it burst. �Oh no, p-please not!�, she screamed. Desperate for cover Li turned towards the wall. The momentum caused her bosom to sway slightly, sealing the fate of her top: Noisily the holes in the fabric extended until the whole shirt completely shredded into pieces which bounced off her buoyant curves as they splayed out to their full size. Also free the bra stuck in her shirt fell from her lower curves, her ample assets wobbling as they were completely exposed. Before the piece of underwear hit the floor Li forcefully pressed the front of her rack against the wall, hiding at least the most private areas from sight. Compressing her bust the top of her mounds pushed against her chin, the teenager gulping as she saw they stood somewhere between volley- and basketballs in size. Still reaching out from her Li had to slightly lean back the further her breasts pressed against the wall, the slopes on her front flattening. In return the sides, bottom and top spread out further, trying to keep their roundings as firm as possible. The walls of her cleavage also were squeezed despite no more top containing them. Feeling the weight trying to drag her down Li put her hands on the lower corners of her bosom, blushing deeply while the flesh bulged against her hands.  
  
Claire�s face also sported a darker shade of red as she watched her friend�s shirt explode. At the same time she noticed her pants were getting dangerously tight as well. Her nervousness increased the louder her trousers stretched over her bum, the redhead hearing stitches pop and fabric creak every second.  Abruptly the noise turned into a loud rip. The tough girl shrieked as she felt the seat of her pants splitting apart, creating a clean rift in the middle of her butt. Shortly afterwards her hips damaged her pants on each side, the vertical tears revealing a slight amount of her stout thighs. Their meat had become so wide the entire upper half of her upper legs rubbed against each other, the amount and pressure gradually growing. As the fabric continued to tighten around the prospering curves of her lower half the tears extended, ripping downwards and into the width. Simultaneously more appeared over her bulging buttocks, revealing small portions of her bright skin and underwear. While the cover on her backside decreased what still covered her became flimsily thin, the brighter camouflage spots turning sheer over her cheeks. Claire groaned, her trousers becoming painfully tight despite turning into Swiss cheese. With a loud burst the entire back of her pants completely tore apart. The rips flew off from her buttocks, the swells of flesh exploding to the size of basket balls. As the seat was gone the rest of her trousers fell down, sliding across her voluminous thighs to her boots. Upon the release her booty wobbled a little, rubbing against her panties. The piece of underwear covered around half of her butt, skin-tight with a good portion of them having been swallowed by her butt gap.   
  
Still busy pressing her billowing bosom against the wall Li looked awkwardly at her friend�s underwear. Though she could only see her panties from the front Claire� butt had pulled so much fabric around it they even lay tightly over her crotch, the waistbands being thin threads stretched across her waist. Li looked a little oddly at the pattern between Claire�s legs. �You� you wear heart-panties?�, she asked.  
  
The blush spread over Claire�s entire face while turning deep red. �T-they were a present, o-okay?�, Claire defended herself. Her pink panties slid further towards her butt gap while at the same time the fabric stretched over her bowling ball buttocks, the red hearts widening around their curves. The waistbands tightened on hips which were wider than most men were at their shoulders, slowly sliding deeper until eventually reaching the top segments of her rear. With the rim of her panties gliding across the steep ascent a rising butt crack looked out above, as well as more of her tight roundings. Claire nervously flailed her arms, the heaviness of her butt causing slight balance problems. While feeling more awkward and embarrassed by the second she noticed how she was getting taller bit by bit as her prospering posterior caused her eye-height to go up, making her see everything from a slightly higher perspective.   
  
At the same time the heavily embarrassed Li had to take a step back from the wall as the pressure in her bosom grew painful, having been compressed so far she almost had to bend her torso 45 degree backwards. But although there was well over a half meter between her �main body� and the wall her breasts squeezed snuggly against the smooth tiles, their front almost flat while their diameter sported a slightly oval form. The Chinese felt incredible discomfort by her skin rubbing against the wall, the ever-swelling masses spreading over it. Growing into concurrence to large water melons the pressure of the curves in her cleavage strengthened, Li having a good sight on the narrowing valley of flesh since half of her view was filled out by the ascending slopes of her bust. Having more to hold by the second Li�s hands slid further towards the bottom of her globes that almost reached down to her belly. She used her lower arms as well to hold the weight of her rack, trying her best to maintain her position while the surging mass of meat tried to push her back.  
  
Both girls� bodies continued to expand, gaining proportions of unworldly dimensions. The shame and panic they endured didn�t make them realise at first their curves were starting to slow down. Claire was the first one to feel her colossal caboose vaulting behind her at a decreasing pace. Looking on her butt she watched the speed of her pink panties sliding over her cheeks bit by bit going down. As two third of her stout butt were revealed the triangle of fabric didn�t arch towards her butt gap anymore, and her butt crack stopped deepening at one inch of depth. Carefully Claire checked for any signs her respectable rear was still swelling. While she inspected her butt Li also began to notice her spurt coming to an end, the rate at which the pressure between her body and the wall was building up constantly dropping. Also the bottoms of her breasts didn�t bulge as strongly against her arms anymore, and their tops didn�t rise as fast as before. Eventually the Asian-skinned domes stopped conquering her sight as they were a little above her nose. At the same moment Claire confirmed for herself her growth was over, seeing and feeling no more expansion in her butt. �Phew, finally!�, the redhead sighed. �I was starting to fear we would keep growing until we block the hallway!�   
  
Li and Claire then exchanged a quick glance, before they continued looking over their bodies. Each of Claire�s buttocks was as large as a medicine ball, the charm of her lower half accented by matching hips and almost one foot wide thighs. Her underwear lay taut over her butt, not like a thong, however as a very revealing pair of panties that left the majority of her unnaturally firm cheeks bare and revealed a noticeable amount of butt cleavage. She had been taller than Li before already, but with the extra mass in her rear Claire would have even towered an inch over the jerk from earlier. On the contrary the small size of the Chinese girl made her huge assets look even more gigantic, the twin orbs of flesh being around an inch wider than Claire�s buttocks. Only the pressure caused by their owner holding them against the wall kept them from splaying out into a pair of perfect spheres, but even like this the stout appeal of her nude breasts was very striking. Li�s legs were shaking slightly, partly because of the weight of her bust, but also because she was shivering all over her body, her face still deep red. �W-what should we do now?�, she asked, nervously tightening the grip on her bosom.  
  
After looking at her gargantuan butt cheeks for a while the colour of Claire�s facial cheeks normalised again, though slight red spots remained. Her panties deformed as she raised one of her legs, the inner curves of her butt rubbing against each other while she stepped out of her broken pants. Though she wasn�t really wearing any less than before Li felt a little uncomfortable as her friend was standing in the hallway wearing nothing but boots, a small camouflage tank-top, and very flimsy pink panties with a deformed heart pattern on them. �Ain�t that obvious?�, the redhead asked, sounding serious and collected again. One hand on her huge hip she pointed with her thumb behind her, towards her backpack. �We gotta bring those stones to the government so they can research them and turn us back to normal!�  
  
Li�s head took on the shade of a fluorescent tomato. Her arms slid up the flanks of her bust, resting around her breasts as if she tried to hug them. �I-I�m not going anywhere without something to cover my chest!�, she screamed, pressing her globes further against the wall. Claire rolled her eyes. As Li squeezed her massive mammaries against the tiles she suddenly felt a sensation in their flesh. At first she feared another growth spurt, but quickly noticed it was something different. With her arms on her bust she could sense slight wobbles, her assets shaking very subtly although she was not moving. After a few second she realised vibrations in the wall were making her bosom quiver. �Hey, do you feel that?�, she asked.   
  
Claire was about to ask what she meant when she felt the ham of her posterior jiggling weakly, so much it was only barely noticeable. It wasn�t a constant sensation, but it occurred in a regular pattern, as if someone was poking her bum every second. Concentrating on it she quickly realised quakes in the floor were causing it, the vibrations moving up her legs and making the flesh of her thighs and buttocks wobble. �Is an earthquake coming?�, she wondered, looking around for a possible source. As her gaze went in Li�s direction, who at the same moment looked at her Claire noticed the face of her friend was turning from red for a Chinese to pale for a Chinese. Shock and fear were written all over it, her eyes wide from scare and the lips of her open mouth trembling. Her whole body was shaking, causing waves of flesh to roll over her bust. �What�s wrong?�, Claire asked her frightened friend.   
  
Slowly Li raised one of her arms. Her hand shook horribly as she stretched it out towards Claire. �L-l-l-l-l-l-look!�, Li stuttered, pointing behind her.  
  
Claire turned her head, swaying her massive butt slightly. As she saw what Li was pointing at she almost fell on her enormous posterior, while her expression slowly changed until it mimicked Li�s. Unable to close her mouth Claire stared in a mixture of shock, disbelief and fear at the girl in the hallway who was causing vibrations at every step, standing directly in front of the backpack full of the mysterious stones.

Third part of the 150k Celebration of the �ExpansionWriters�-Club.  
  
I knew I would have to bust the size limit of three pages for my entry, but I even busted my own set limit of seven pages. I think it was worth it though ![;)](./I3reacl_files/wink.gif ";) (Wink)") Also sorry I didn�t finish it sooner, but I was surprised with the second part in one of the rare periods of the year when I am actually busy![^^;](./I3reacl_files/animesweat.gif "Sweating a little...") So I had to push it back a bit.   
  
This one doesn�t feature the group from the previous parts, mostly because I felt unfamiliar writing about multiboobs, and because I think it�s more clever to open a side-plot with some of the remaining characters instead of letting the �main Party� just randomly stumble across one girl after another ![:P](./I3reacl_files/=p.gif ":P (Lick)") To make sure this part doesn�t feel too unrelated to the rest of the story I left the ending open so someone can pick up on it in one of the next parts (it�s actually funny to insert a cliff-hanger and have no idea how it�ll turn out^^)  
  
Anyway, I hope you enjoy it!

I knew you would go over the three page limit as well since you are always very detailed with your growth and clothes rippage. But it still came out very good and I like the shift in focus to some of the other characters, the cliff hanger was a nice touch as well, assuming the next guy can make good use of it.

I noticed that, but still even your 'vauge' descriptions are well written enough that the reader doesn't have to try to hard to picture the scene. Unless of course they have absolutely no imagination what so ever, no amount of details would help them picture it. And most of your stories are detailed enough that a blind man could picture a scene from it.

**The genie from the milk bottle**There weren't many people who could open a door with their feet, but Amanda was one of them.  
  
Holding the key between her toes the young woman put it into the keyhole, bending a little backwards. She had to be careful nothing would fall out of the box she was carrying in her arms. �That was a good day", she said to herself, looking at all the plastic items, cans and other garbage she had collected. �I can make a lot out of this stuff!"  
  
With little effort she tilted the key around, opening the door. Her apartment looked like one would expect it from a 24-year old woman, maybe a bit larger than the average. The greatest difference be](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/The-genie-from-the-milk-bottle-196457100)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Snow Boobs**It was a late afternoon in December when a young woman was taking a walk through the park. Flakes danced around her nose as she walked over the snow-clad path, smiling at the white scenery around her. The branches of the trees were buckling under the weight of the snow, while the usually lush and green lawn was hidden beneath an at least two inch deep layer of snow. The path the woman was walking on wasn't quite as snowed, but her large winter boots still left deep imprints behind her. While it wasn't pitch-black the lanterns on each side of the path were already shining, their light reflecting in the surrounding snow, and with each minute th](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Snow-Boobs-275240349)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Short and Sweet**Lilly wasn't really a snoopy girl. But when she coincidentally witnessed as her mother received a package at the garden gate from the postman, and then went back into the house, acting all secret as if she wanted nobody to see her bringing some package into the house, and when Lilly afterwards spotted her putting a load of red bonbons from the package into a jar that she hid on top of the highest shelf in the kitchen, it was enough to make the short girl move a chair under said shelf, put a pile of books on top of it and step onto the books to reach for the jar.  
  
"Come on", Lilly murmured. She raised herself on the very tips of her toes, stre](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Short-and-Sweet-306536048)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Mammary Mentality**�Doctor, I�m obsessed with boobs!�  
  
Through her rectangular glasses Quinn looked up from her notepad to the man lying on the red couch in front of her. Sitting on her office chair her legs were crossed, partly out of habit, partly so her patient couldn�t peek under her knee-long grey skirt that lay tightly around her thighs and hips. Dark nylon thighs covered her smooth legs, and she wore black high-heels on her small feet. �It is true that during our little sessions you have revealed several aspects of your personality hold a particular interest in the exclusive charm of a woman�s body, especially when the](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Mammary-Mentality-337778591)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Tooth fairy meets Boob fairy I**It was a warm summer night in a little town. Moonlight streamed through the half-open window into the bedroom of a small house, bathing the bed inside it in a dim silver sheen. Underneath the blanket a woman was peacefully sleeping, breathing softly as she lay on her back. As it was a warm night she had only covered herself with her blanket up to her belly, leaving her chest and arms free. Between her small, yet decently shaped breasts the four buttons of her light blue pyjama top were resting, all being closed. Slightly they went up and down with each breath the woman made, rising and falling in a slow, steady rhythm. She barely made a sound](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Tooth-fairy-meets-Boob-fairy-I-330773257)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Dear Dairy**Dear Dairy,  
  
Whoops, typo! But it's kind of funny. Maybe I'll start all my diary entries like that? ;P  
  
Anyway, since quite a few things have happened lately in my life and I don't have anyone right now to talk to (at least yet) I guessed I could start a diary. Of yourse� again a typo, but this one happens actually quite a lot to me ^\_^; Anyway, of yourse it's not like I don't have any friends or a family. Right now, they're all just a few hundred miles away from me. I moved away from home a few days ago for college, and don't know many people here yet. And I'm not really the kind of person who likes to talk all day on the telephone. But](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Dear-Dairy-293882315)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**50k Race**"All bikers to the starting line! I repeat, all bikers to the starting line!"  
  
Hearing the voice of the announcer Gina stretched herself one more time, raising her right hand far above her head while holding the left one on her hip. She tilted her body to the left and spread out her right leg, her blond smooth hair shining brightly in the afternoon sun as it fell to her shoulder. Finishing her warm-up Gina relaxed her pose again. She wiped a strand of hair from her face and tucked it behind her ear, while her blue eyes threw a casual glance at the large church tower clock above her. Only a few minutes before the race would start. She grabbed](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/50k-Race-318394036) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Tooth fairy meets Boob fairy II**The wind softly blew through the bedroom window of the small one-family house, gracing the sheets of the bed as well as the woman resting inside it. The gentle breeze also blew over her breasts that were looking out above the blanket, a pair of decently sized and shaped orbs with the diameter of CDs. Though she was lying on her back they protruded firmly out from her body, sticking as a pair of round globes towards the ceiling. Their spherical form wasn�t their most striking feature however. If somebody had stood next to her he would have seen the curved flanks of her bosom were slowly vaulting outwards, the fabric of her pyjama being p](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Tooth-fairy-meets-Boob-fairy-II-335192451)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**BE careful what you wish for, part 2**Many people had run into the mall to escape the rain. A lot of them remained even after the sun had come out again, walking from one shop to the next to search for something they might need. A young 18-year-old brunette forced her way through the crowd that had assembled in the mall, ignoring the glares that were thrown at her. The look on her face was even more furious than those of the people that she pushed aside. Her long ponytail swayed as she constantly changed directions, almost lashing like a whip through the crowd. The high school student wasn't heading for the exit or a specific store. She just walked aimlessly through the mall.

Sabrina and I smiled at one another as we pushed the bedroom door open. Brad was in bed watching a baseball game that was on tv, and didn't seem to notice us at first until Sabrina walked in front of the tv and around the bed.  
  
"Oh, hey."  
  
Sabrina and I giggled, "Hi, Brad!"  
  
He smiled, "How come you two seem so....cheery?"  
  
"Just happy to see you," I winked at Sabrina.  
  
"Yeah," she said. "We're just soooo happy to see you."  
  
He looked at both of us with a peculiar look, "I see. So, it's about....ten o'clock. Why is Sabrina still here? No offense, but I thought she was going home hours ago."

**BE Married**Adriana Griffin squeezed her long, lean torso up against Ryan Bittan's muscular arm.  "I can't believe we're finally going to go get rings!" she said, the joy in her voice unmistakable.  
  
Ryan smiled down at his fiancee.  He was only 3 inches taller than her, but she was leaning down into his shoulder with her "hug."  "Yeah, I know," he said.  "It does seem like we've been dating forever."  
  
She looked up at him.  "Three years," she said.  "But, next month, it's going to be permanent."  
  
"Next month, Mrs. Bittan?" Ryan said.  "Try in 15 days.  We've already got the l](http://macromega.deviantart.com/art/BE-Married-308685362)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)

"Because you can't find stuff like this anywhere else." Emily tossed another bra over the door for her friend to try.  
  
"Would you want to?" Katrina strip once again. She stared at her topless reflection avoiding the next garment her Emily suggested. 'Not that it matters what I wear over my boobs anyway.; She thought to herself as she cupped the little A-cup breasts on her chest. All her friends had boobs.

**Expanding Lingerie**Josie was about to start college and wanted some new clothes and underwear before she started her new life.  
She went to the mall and checked out the department store. Finding clothes for Josie was always easy because of her thin build. She had cute 32b cups breast, and 34" waist. The blonde picked up a few clothes, then got a cute red bra and panties she liked and went into the dressing room.  
As Josie took off her clothes and tried the lingerie, she liked the feel and look the red bra and panties gave her in the mirror, but she noticed some itching on her boobs and ass shortly after putting on the underwear.

Carly sighed as she followed close behind Stacy and Susan. It had rained off and on all day, but luckily for them it wasn't raining at that time.

Being an alien princess was a lot of work, especially with learning how to speak the thousands of languages throughout the universe. But one thing Pandora really loved about her people, was that all the females of her species could "change" their bodies any way they wanted. It's main purpose was to attract mates, but every now and then she'd have a little fun with her special ability.  
  
Pandora would often visit planet Earth and hang out with some earthlings she called friends. With her skin being leafy green, it was hard to blend in with everyone, though.

I figured this would be the perfect time to try this new "product" that I had heard so much about. I walked over and reached into my purse, "Ah, here it is. For fifteen dollars, this stuff better work."

 There it was, hanging from Amanda's chest: A pair of smooth breasts, shaped into such a perfectly spherical form it looked like someone had molded them in meticulous detail work. Despite the firmness that made them stick out proudly from the body attached to them their flesh gave slightly in to the hands that wandered over them. Softly the tender meat was caressed as the fingers wandered from the fabric on the flanks to the skin revealed in the cleavage, kneading the breasts like a baker his dough. Amanda rubbed her palms over her sensitive mounds, wondering how large they were. Grapefruits? Cantaloupes? It was something in between that was stuffed into her white blouse she eventually concluded. But instead of fruit flesh the balls in her top were made out of soft human tissue, tissue that a few minutes ago had just been a plain board. She moved her hands to the bottom of her breasts, cupping them to feel their weight and shape. Usually, one would have expected the young woman who had always been dreaming of big breasts to freak out in pure excitement. Instead of squealing in joy however Amanda furrowed her brows. "Hey, that went way too far!", the blond girl yelled. "I said a little, not a ton! Puff them up again!"  
  
Her words were for the figure floating above Amanda's glass table in the middle of the room. The hovering woman seemed to be lying sideway in the air, her legs crossed over each other, one hand on her waist while she leaned her face against her fist.  She seemed to be from Orient origins, having dark skin and smooth black hair tied into a long pony tail, and wearing baggy bright yellow pantaloons along a cropped purple tank-top and pink banana shoes. Her right eye was hidden behind her bangs, while her left eye stared down on Amanda. Aside from floating through the air another notable feature about the woman were her pointy ears on which a pair of golden earrings were hanging, one shaped like the moon and the other like the sun. "Sorry, but three's the limit", the genie reminded her. Her voice lacked any kind of emotion, except for a slight sarcastic and monotonous undertone. "No extra wishes, no trade backs. It was already a bonus that I repaired your top. If you wanted them larger you should have stated your wish more precisely. Deal with it or keep mourning."  
  
Amanda murmured something that would get this story a tag for explicit language if it was mentioned. But then she looked down on herself. Usually her sight would meet a flat blouse containing an even flatter bosom. Instead a pair of ripe breasts was sticking out from her chest, lying snuggly inside the taut white fabric. The upper buttons were open, crafting a deep cleavage into her top. The V-shaped gap started at her shoulders, went in slight curves down her breasts, the fabric just covering her breast warts, and ending an inch before the end of her bosom in a pointy tip. Each of her globes was firm and round, not sagging in the least, and their skin was as smooth and clean as a baby-butt. Still holding them she lifted her breasts a little up, before she switched the position of her hands. Her frowning face brightened up as she hugged her bosom, sighing in delight as she squeezed her buoyant meat in her arms. No, she wouldn't mourn.   
  
Closing her eyes Amanda got lost for a second in daydreams. As she opened them again she noticed the genie was staring at her. Which actually wasn't surprising considering how she behaved, but something in her glance was strange. The way she looked at her Amanda could see something that went beyond staring at a woman fondling her breasts. "Um�something wrong?", she asked.  
  
Her eye on Amanda's bosom the genie shook her head. "The first wish I ever granted that was not taken back, and it's a pair of tits!", she moaned.  
  
The smile crept back on Amanda's face. "No need to thank me!", she chuckled. As she looked at the genie floating above her however she frowned again. "Speaking of which�" Amanda pointed with her finger at the genie's chest. "I didn't nullify my wish on your tits either!"  
  
The genie looked down on her small, but still not flat breasts that curved out the fabric of her tank-top just so much one could see them. "My bad", she apologized, though she didn't really sound sorry. "You said "make them a little bit smaller", so I thought you meant yours and mine. And since mine were much smaller in comparison to yours I shrunk them down to their original size."  
  
Amanda removed her arms from her bosom to fold them beneath it. "Geez, you genies think you are so clever, don't you?", she sighed. Her hands then quickly found their way back to her assets, cupping and enveloping the curved goods. She leaned over her glass table, staring at the weak reflection of her. Small jiggles went through her breasts as she tilted her body from side to side, feeling every vibration in her hands while she inspected herself from every angle. "So?", she said after a while.  
  
The genie raised an eye-brow. "So what?", she asked.  
  
After admiring herself Amanda took her hands off her chest again. It bounced as she straightened herself up, looking the genie in the eye. "You granted me three wishes. Aren't you supposed to be leaving in a puff of smoke or something?" Smiling slightly she pushed her breasts up a little, making them spill over the rim of her blouse. "Of course, you're free to stay and admire my boobs as long as you want!", she added with a wink.  
  
Crossing her legs in the air the genie leaned a little forward, putting her hands on her waist. "My, how generous we are", she scoffed. "And I'm really awfully sorry to refuse the kind offer. But as you just said, I granted you three wishes, and therefore my business with you is over. So, sad as it is, I'll have to vanish back into my bottle, teleport it into some corner of the world and then wait until the next lucky person stumbles across it, rubs it and finds out three wishes aren't enough to make his or her life perfect and puts everything back to the way it was."  
  
Amanda crossed her hands behind her back, bopping around on her feet. "Send me a postcard from time to time!", she chirped.  
  
The genie sighed. "I'll follow your blog", she said, raising her arms. She concentrated for a moment before she clapped her hands together. Pink smoke emitted from her palms, steadily wandering up her arms and surrounding them. Reaching her shoulders the smoke began to wander over her entire body, from her chest to her belly down to her legs, bit by bit cloaking the mystical spirit. "Bye bye", the genie said as the smoke reached her face.   
  
Quickly Amanda waved to her before her eye was hidden behind the pink curtain of smoke. "Bye!", she called out to her. As the genie was completely surrounded by pink smoke the human-formed cloud began to change its shape. From her head it began to turn around itself, forming a ball. After hanging in the air for a while it suddenly flew in circles up to the ceiling, stretching to a line of smoke on the way, before it dived down straightly towards the bottle on the table and flew into it. "And� thanks!", Amanda added just as the last rest of the cloud vanished inside the bottle.   
  
A bright flash illuminated the room, blinding Amanda. She stumbled backwards, just a few steps. It wouldn't have been a problem if there wasn't that extra meat on her chest that made her a bit more top-heavy. So when she leaned back to keep her balance she achieved the exact opposite result: Still half-blind she flailed her arms through the air as she fell backwards, but eventually could only yelp when her butt landed hardly on the carpet. The impact went from her rear right to her bosom, hopping and jiggling up and down inside the neck of her blouse. "Guess I'll have to be a little more careful with these", Amanda murmured, rubbing her rump. Quickly however her hands left her posterior and found their place on the bulges of her chest. Again Amanda smiled in delight. Sitting on the floor she leaned back, further and further until she couldn't hold her balance and dropped right on to her back. As her upper body fell her legs were thrown into the air, Amanda wriggling her feet while she softly stroked the sides of her meat buns. Each contact with her breasts made the skin of her assets tingle as if small ants were crawling over them, or as if tiny hands softly massaged them. Closing her eyes Amanda shook her head from side to side, her glasses almost falling from her nose. She squeezed her breasts, let them spill through the gaps between her fingers, and pressed her blouse skin-tight against their curves. Soft moans slipped through her lips as caressed her bosom while lying on her back. A sudden urge overcame her, a craving deep inside her. The more she rubbed her breasts, the stronger the tingle grew, the more pleasure the massage created in her young body the more her thoughts were consumed by that desire, until she couldn't hold it in anymore.  
  
She had to create some art!  
  
"Oh, I'm so full of inspiration, I'm about to explode!", she squealed. With a single motion jumped right back on her feet, the movements of the maneuver going straight in her chest. One quick glance after she corrected her glasses and she saw the carton with the materials was still standing on the TV table, alongside the two piles for usable and unusable stuff she had sorted out � or rather the one pile for usable stuff as she found use for pretty much everything. The results of Amanda's artistic talent showed in the various little figurines, busts and large statues that could be found everywhere in her apartment, in every corner, on every surface, some were even hanging from the ceiling. Each of her works was made out of garbage from empty cans and old newspapers to all kind of plastic items, and had been painted in bright colors like pink, magenta or turquoise. The general motif of her art was always the same: Women in poses that were indecent at best, with breasts ranging from her current measurements up to sizes far beyond what an actual woman would have been able to bear without breaking her back. Most statues were tending towards the latter. Her record was a baby-blue life-sized statue in her bedroom, portraying a woman with long hair which she held up with her arms. It was made out of many different materials from cans to plastic bottles and wires linked together in a way one couldn't see the individual objects anymore. For the breasts Amanda had used a pair of beach balls that she had pumped up to the absolute limit, and additionally put several layers of papier-m�ch� around them to make them even bigger. It was her largest piece yet, both in general and bust size. Yet.  
  
As she kneeled down towards the box visions of her next sculpture were flowing into Amanda's mind: A woman lying on top of her breasts like she had before, barely able to embrace them with her arms, while her feet just touched the ground. No, she thought, the feet were already in the air, and her breasts so big she couldn't even reach half around them. No, even better, they were so big she was really lying with her whole body on top of them, like on a bed, unable to even see the slopes of her breasts on top of her bosom. Or maybe, yes, she could just make a pair of giant spheres three times bigger than those of the statue in her bedroom, and place a tiny figurine on top of it! Giggling in excitement Amanda looked through the contents of the box, searching for something she could make a small statue out of. "Best I'll use filled up garbage bags for he boobs", she mumbled to herself, digging with both hands through the half-empty box. "I don't think I'll find beach balls anywhere big-"  
  
As she pulled out some scrapped metal of the box she suddenly noticed the milk bottle on her table.   
  
Blinking Amanda stared at the bottle. It looked exactly like that of the genie, the glass blind glass and the neck slim. Slowly she put the metal scrap back into the box and stood up. "It can't be", she mumbled while she walked around her table, eyes focused on the bottle. Hesitantly she reached her arm out for it, her cleavage pressing against her blouse as she leaned towards it. The tip of her finger graced the thick glass, leaving a fine trail of sweat on it. As her hand had moved up to the neck of the bottle she grabbed it, while her second hand pulled out a handkerchief from her pocket. Again she hesitated. After a while she brought the handkerchief towards the bottle. One half the way she made another pause. Eventually the fabric of the handkerchief touched the glass. One final hesitation. Then, Amanda rubbed the bottle with the handkerchief.  
  
At first, nothing happened. As Amanda pulled back the handkerchief however she saw a weak pink gleam at the ground of the bottle. Not sure if she was just imagining it she leaned with her face closely towards it. Suddenly, a large cloud of pink smoke shot out of it. Startled Amanda pulled her body back, falling on her back once more with her heavy humps hopping on her chest while she watched the cloud taking the form of a woman. Once the shade was complete the smoke dispersed into thin air, Amanda staring in surprise as the genie appeared again. She hovered above the table, hands on her hips, just like when she had summoned her a few minutes ago.   
  
Slowly Amanda got back up on her feet. Both women stood in the room, the human on the floor, the spirit in the air. The young art student Stared up to genie, partly surprised, partly confused, partly irritated. The supernatural looked over Amanda's head at the wall, her stoic face only showing slight hints of confusion. "This� is a little awkward", she eventually said.   
  
Crossing her arms below her breasts Amanda tilted her head. "Um, I thought you would vanish after granting me three wishes?", she asked.  
  
"I thought that too, but�" The genie pondered for a moment. "Now that I think about it, there isn't really any rule that says we disappear after granting three wishes. It's just that� because every third wish was to reset everything I did� my bottle was either put back to the place where my former master had found it or transported to some place where it was out of his reach at the time he would have stumbled across it. This� this is the first time someone has not wished to have never met me before."  
  
Behind her glasses a spark appeared in Amanda's eyes. "So�does that mean�"  
  
Though she still looked rather composed the genie gulped. "It seems as long as you are in possession of my bottle, every time you rub it you gain three new wishes."  
  
The blonde girl rose on her tip-roes. "Meaning basically I have as many wishes as I want?"  
  
Slowly the genie nodded. "It would appear this is the case, yes�"  
  
For a moment silence fell over the room. But it was broken by Amanda's loud scream of joy as she jumped into the air, raising her arms above her head.   
  
"SSSSSWWEEEEEEEET!" Her bosom's bounces followed the rest of Amanda as she hopped up and down, jubilating like a little girl. "I have a genie, a FREAKING GENIE, all for myself! Oh, this is so cool! I'll never have to clean my house again, I can just wish the dirt away! I don't need to go shopping anymore, I can summon everything I want! I won't have to pay taxes, I can wish for my own electricity! Hell, I can wish for my own power plant to run the entire town! But most importantly�" Pulling her arms around them she hugged her meat pillows, squishing them as tightly as she could. "I CAN WISH FOR BIG BOOBIES ANYTIME!!!"  
  
The genie rolled her eyes.  
  
Cheerfully Amanda jumped onto her couch. As her rump landed on it her breasts wobbled inside her hands, jiggling like jello. "Awesome!", she whispered "So awesome!! Mega awesome!!! Like, the most awesome thing in the history of AWESOME!!!" Amanda wriggled her legs, her whole body shaking in excitement. The genie still floated above the table, hands on her hips, while looking nervously at the hyperactive art student on the couch. "So, what can I do?", she suddenly asked. "Or rather what can't I do?"   
  
The genie frowned. "What do you mean "can't do"?", she asked back, sounding a little insulted. "I'm an omnipotent spirit! I can mess with pretty much everything, from life and death to gravity, the entire concept of reality � even the fabric of time is something I can only yawn at!"  
  
Amanda pulled her legs onto the couch and crossed them, embracing her ankles with her hands.  The neck of her blouse slid a little deeper as she leaned forward, increasing the pressure in her cleavage. "But you said there were restrictions", she reminded the genie, looking straight at her. "For example, you said you weren't allowed to grant wishes that involve anything impossible or illegal. What exactly does that mean?"  
  
The genie relaxed a little. "Oh yeah, that stuff", she remembered. "Well, it is a very loose restriction, actually. Impossible simply means that you cannot wish for things that make no sense, are paradox or contradict themselves, like you wish to be your own sister, or want a white mouse that is red. Illegal means you cannot wish for things that go against the genie codex. For example, you can't wish to become a genie yourself, or increase the number of your wishes. Though the latter is rather redundant in this situation�"  
  
Amanda tilted her head to the side. "But I still can do things that go against the normal law?"  
  
The genie nodded. "The laws of your race, yes."  
  
"So theoretically", Amanda asked after pondering a moment. "I could use your magic to, let's say, print fake money?"  
  
The genie shrugged. "Sure."  
  
"Or rob a bank?", Amanda asked further.  
  
"No problem."  
  
"Steal something from someone else?"  
  
"Certainly."  
  
"Beat someone up?"  
  
"Why, yes of course."  
  
Amy paused. "Kill somebody?"  
  
"Yes", the genie said without hesitation.  
  
Amy bit her lips. "And� did you ever do that?"  
  
"What?"  
  
"You know� have you ever killed someone?"  
  
"A few times." Behind her glasses Amanda's eyes enlarged in shock.  "Jeez, don't give me that look!", the genie sighed. "I told you none of my wishes have ever lasted. In the end, my masters either found the death of the person they thought would make their lives better actually made it worse, or simply felt guilty after a while. So, like everyone else, they used their third wish, and Bada-Bing � the people I killed were put back to life as if nothing had happened. Which was actually the case since I set back time to the moment before my master found me."   
  
Amanda still seemed rather unsettled. "But didn't you ever feel guilty?", she asked. "I mean, what if somebody wouldn't have taken his wish back, and the person stayed dead?"  
  
The genie folded her arms over her chest and crossed her legs in the air. "In the beginning", she said, looking up towards the ceiling with her one uncovered eye "When I was still fresh in the biz I had those doubts too. So the first times my masters wished for me to kill a certain person I used the legendary wit of the genies to misinterpret their wishes. For example, when one young master wished for his father to die from a heart-attack, I granted that wish � fifty years later, when my master's father was a stuttering old man who talked to bunnies. My master took the wish back simply out of rage at me." Amanda chuckled. "Of course it's not always that simple", she told her. "Another time my master led me to a cliff where some guy he owed money was standing. He wished me to break off the cliff so the guy would fall into death."  
  
"What did you do?", Amanda asked.  
  
For a short moment a smirk flashed over the genie's face. "I broke off the cliff - the entire cliff, including the part he was standing on. I don't think anyone has so quickly spoken the word "I wish I had never found you" before." Upon this memory the genie even laughed a bit. The corners of her mouth however quickly fell back into their usual position. "Eventually though I stopped caring. Even if I didn't misread my master's wishes, in the end they would always put back their wish by themselves. You can give humans whatever they want, they won't be satisfied by it."  
  
Amanda crossed her hands behind her back. "Well, I am very satisfied!", she giggled, sticking her chest out.  
  
Moaning the genie let her head fall back. "Oh yeah, I am so happy for you", she said. "After eons of granting wishes for mortals my reward is to be the slave of a lunatic artist who is obsessed with ridiculously enchanted milk glands."  
  
Said milk glands were put into motion again as Amanda jumped off from the couch. "Speaking of which, it's time to get back to business!", she declared. Both hands pointed at her open blouse and the two stacks of meat inside them. "First off, I wish myself super-busty again, just like before, no, even bigger than that! Yeah, that'll be a nice start! And then-"  
  
"Sorry, but I can't do that."  
  
Amanda looked at the genie as if she had just learned she only had three minutes to live. "Er� what?"  
  
The genie's unmoving face looked at the wall behind Amanda, as if there was something interesting to look at - which was actually the case, namely a series of statues that showed several moaning women who were fondling their melon-sized assets. "I can't grant you wishes that make your breasts bigger", the genie told Amanda without looking at her.  
  
The slopes of Amanda's breasts pressed a little further out of her cleavage as she crossed her arms under her bosom, staring sternly at "her" genie. "Now hold on a second! I don't think growing bigger breasts is illegal or impossible � or at least it wasn't ten minutes ago!", she said rather angrily.  
  
The eye of the genie looked down on Amanda, the expression on her face not wavering. "Since you seem to have such a good memory, master, you certainly also remember there was a third restriction."  
  
Amanda pulled her head back in confusion. "Um, you said you don't grant any wishes that involve spinach", she recited the genie's words. "But I don't see how this is-"  
  
"Then allow me to explain", the spirit interrupted her. "After being released from its lamp � or in this case bottle � every genie has the right to deny wishes of a certain kind. This rule is basically the only right we genies possess, and we fought very hard to get it into the codex. Usually I tell my masters not to wish for anything related to spinach. But I've decided that for you, any breast-related wishes are forbidden."  
  
Amanda blinked at the genie. "N-now hold on! You� you�" Amanda thought for a moment what she actually wanted to say. "You said "after being released from your bottle", but I already released you earlier!", she shot into the blue. "You already set your taboo back then, and it was about spinach!"  
  
The genie's face didn't budge. "You said it yourself just now", she replied dryly. "The rule says "After being released", but it doesn't directly say only after the first time. So, it could be read as "every time you release me I can setup a taboo", and you just had me come out again."   
  
Almost desperately Amanda searched a way out of this. "W-why don't you want to make my breasts bigger?", she asked.  
  
The genie stuck out her own chest. "Cause you'd end up wishing not only your breasts to the size of the moon, but mine too!", she yelled. "You're most likely going to stay my master for a while, and I don't just want to grant breast-related wishes every day!"  
  
Amanda pondered for a moment. "How about I restrict the breast wishes to certain days then?", she suggested. "Like I can only wish for bigger boobs on holidays?"  
  
"Yeah, nice try", the genie commented. "You'll just google the Independence Day of Sumatra or something and make everyday a holiday!" Amanda believed to see the corners of the genie's twitching as if she was holding back a smile. "So, I am truly sorry master, but I am afraid you must be content with what I already gave you."  
  
At first Amanda just stared at the genie. She was clearly angry, looking like she would hold back to not burst out in anger, while at the same time she seemed desperate to think of something she could say back. Suddenly the genie saw a smile creeping over her master's face, but only for a second as she turned away. "Okay, fine, have it your way. No breasts. You got me." Amanda walked around the room, showing her back to the genie who suspiciously looked after her. "You know what? I'm kind of hungry."  
  
Shaking her head the genie sighed. "Jeez, something to eat, the favorite for first wishes." She raised her arms. "What shall it be? A sandwich? Chicken? Or maybe a chicken sandwhich?"  
  
With a wide grin Amanda turned around. "A big bowl of spinach!"   
  
The genie blinked at Amanda, paralysed. "M-maybe we could talk about your holiday idea�"  
  
Two hours later the genie and Amanda were leaning over a six pages long contract. Amanda was kneeling on the ground in front of the table while the genie floated above it, holding the contract in one hand.  
  
"All right", the genie said, pointing with the pen in her other hand at various spots on the contract as she spoke. "You can grow breasts to maximally the size of small weather balloons on five individual holidays picked by yourself, and to smaller sports balls during any day of the Christmas and Halloween season, but with a limit of three breast growth wishes in a day, and a one day break if all spurts have been used up on three days in a row. And we take Christmas season by United States standard, which means from the first to the 25th of December. Got it?"  
  
Amanda pushed up her glasses, skimming through the various paragraphs and clauses written in one-hundred percent accurate legal English. "And on my birthday size and number are unlimited, right?", she asked. The genie from  
  
The genie nodded. "That's right. To celebrate the day you fell out of your mother's womb you can blow up your rack to mountain-size. Therefore, you won't wish for anything breast-related during the rest of the year, and spinach is absolutely taboo. Deal?"   
  
"Deal!", Amanda chirped. She took the pen from the genie and set her signature below the last page. After that she filled out a list on the third page with the names of five holidays. Once she was done the genie took the contract and the pen and levitated a bit higher into the air.  
  
"Let's see", she murmured, quickly skimming through the list. She raised her glance from the paper, looking at her master. "Saint Patrick's Day? Seriously?"  
  
"My grandfather was half-Irish!"  
  
"Whatever." She tucked the manuscript under her arm and clapped her hands. Shining sparkles surrounded the contract and the pen before both disappeared into a puff of pink smoke. "Okay, that's settled!", she said, putting her hands on her hips. "Hm. That went surprisingly smooth�"  
  
"Um, we argued for about two hours�"  
  
"Yeah, but in the end, after I agreed to unlimited size on your birthday you gave in pretty� quickly." Her free eye looked suspiciously at Amanda, who made a face like she was an angel. Or an innocent child. Or an innocent angel child. "So, got any wishes for the moment?", she asked.  
  
"Just one little thing", Amanda said, and from one moment to the next the angel kid turned into a devil brat. "I wish every day was my birthday!"  
  
To Amanda's surprise the genie only reacted with a snort. "Oh my, how completely unpredictable", she said. "You've totally got me with that one." Sighing she put her hands into position. "As thy wish!", she exclaimed. As she clapped her hands it seemed as if nothing had changed. Still though, Amanda knew her magic had caused it to become her birthday. And she already had plenty good ideas for a birthday wish.   
  
"Alright!", she declared. She looked into her d�collet�, and cupped her ample assets with both hands. "I'm itching to wish myself into boob haven, but I think that can wait for the moment. First off-"  
  
Suddenly Amanda felt a finger on her lips. "Yeah yeah, I know", the genie said. She floated a bit back and raised her arms. After hesitating a moment she clapped her palms together. Her own magical power engulfed her, the genie taking in a deep breath as she began to feel its effects. Slowly the flesh of her breasts began to bulge, arching on every side. The genie grunted as her small mounds rose up from her chest, her skin rubbing over the inside of her bra as it was reaching out from her body. Amanda watched the genie's growth with glee, and didn't do anything to hide her joy.   
  
"Wow, did you read my mind?", she asked while bouncing on her feet, causing her breasts to jiggle inside her taut blouse.  
  
As the cups of her bra were pressed against her top they smoothed the purple fabric, gradually pronouncing the round form of her growing assets.  "Nope", the genie replied, feeling them slightly spill out of the cups of her bra. The bottom of her bosom lolled out, and the straps around her shoulders and back as well as the little band that held her bra together at the front were stretching. Meanwhile the inner sides of her breasts vaulted towards each other, and the neck of her top steadily slid deeper towards her bulging bosom. "It just doesn't take very long for one to understand how your mind works."  
  
The jiggles of her breasts slowed down as Amanda stopped hopping. "Oh yeah?", she asked, putting her hands on her hips in insult. "How exactly does it work?"  
  
Wrapping the fabric around their swelling curves the hem of the genie's top began to rise up, very slowly at first, but the further her chest reached out from her body the faster it rose. "Ten percent maintain the necessary life functions like breathing and heart-beat while the other 90 percent constantly shout 'Boobs!'", the genie replied dryly, arching her shoulders slightly as the pressure on her bra was growing.  
  
Amanda looked up to the genie. The stern look on her face vanished and was replaced by a smile. "Yup, that pretty much sums me up!", she giggled.  
  
The genie sighed. Growing to the size of small citrus fruits her breasts pressed with rising force out of the bra that confined them, seemingly pouring over the cups as were pushed forward. While the space inside her clothes diminished the sensitivity of the genie's bosom increased to a point where the spirit could feel a subtle tingle inside her mounds. The feeling wasn't unpleasant, reminding her a bit of a massage, but still she groaned as it became steadily more apparent the stronger her flesh surged against her clothes. Through the gap between the holders the tops of her breasts began to lurk out of her top, showing as the distance between them shrunk below an inch. Reaching out from her the widest part of her breasts slowly moved away from her chest wall, shaping them towards a pair of small spheres. The speed of the growth seemed to decrease, but in truth the swelling masses of meat were held back by her bra. The front of her bosom that was shining roundly through her stretching top was getting a little "flatter", while steadily more of her roundings were lapping out of the cups. Growing out of their support the skin of her breasts rubbed over the hard edges of her bra and began to slightly press into them, seemingly digging deeper the more they overflowed her bra. The genie blew out a sharp breath as they touched each other. At first only the very tips of her breasts' slopes came into contact, creating a tiny tingle, before the zones where her breasts rubbed against each other slowly spread out over their complete insides. The excerpt on her bosom above her top slowly extended, revealing the tops of her dark-skinned curves as well as a deepening amount of her narrowing breast gap. As the fabric slid down her globes the growing pressure eliminated the remaining wrinkles, smoothing it tightly around her roundings and showing their bulging form ever clearer. The bigger her breasts were getting the firmer they seemed to become: Ignoring the laws of gravity they proudly protruded from her, stout like a pair of small rubber balls. Amanda watched the genie grow with great interest, licking her lips as she took in every detail of the swelling rack. "Do you wish for a handkerchief, master?", the genie asked.   
  
Thrown out of her trance Amanda looked up to the genie's face. "Uh, no", she said, blinking in confusion. "Why?"  
  
The genie's wanted to respond, but the word suddenly got caught up in her throat. Her sensitive skin felt like it was stretching around her humps just like her clothes, giving the spirit shivering goose bumps as it pressed with growing force against her tank-top, and stroke against the inside of her bra. The tight piece of underwear rested so tightly around them her breasts had taken the shape of classic American apple pies, being roughly a third wider than longer. Forcing down the sensations in her body down she opened her mouth to get out her reply. Instead however she gasped as the band between on the front of her bra ripped apart. The tense straps immediately relaxed and virtually dragged the cups over the slopes of her bosom, leading them to spread out to their full form. Feeling her bra slide over her breasts was already tough for the genie. Feeling her breasts jolt forward from the release in pressure and transfer their width into length also added to the already strong sensations inside her. Adding that her buoyant mounds hopped up and down after their breakthrough, bouncing against her chest wall and then due to the caused impact in a slight curve a few inches upwards, the inner sides of her breasts slightly rubbing against each other and her much tighter tank-top, all of that together was enough to lure a soft, almost inaudible moan out of the genie who slightly put her head back and closed her eyes halfway. She panted a little, each breath clearly showing on the tenseness of the purple fabric that stretched and "relaxed" around her forth and back moving bust, though it always stayed very taut. "I thought it might come in handy to catch the drool that's probably gonna flow out of your mouth", the cynicism finally broke out of the genie, although rather late. With a clap of her hands she magically removed her broken bra from inside her top. The motion of her hands showed immediately on her bust, making the genie grind her teeth for a moment.   
  
By then the widest parts of her breasts were a bit larger in diameter than CDs, and just as round. The rim of her neck had curved just like her bosom, being an almost perfect half-circle. Above it one could see the tops of the genie's bosom, a pair of dark mounds that sported a vaguely two inch deep cleavage in the middle, a small, yet enticingly tight gap. The hem of her top had also wandered upwards noticeably, and the fabric had been wrapped around the bottom of her breasts so tightly the contours of their curves could be seen. The flanks of her breasts were almost as wide as her shoulders, steadily vaulting beyond them as they swell outwards. As they ranged into the area of cantaloupes the genie could feel the growth inside her sensitive assets was slowing down. The pace at which the fabric was stretched decreased, while the rim of her top began to settle at its place. Still the surface of her bust continued to expand for a while, and the genie felt every added square millimeter rubbing against her top. It rested on her bosom like a second skin, creating a strong prickle all around. Inside her wide pantaloons the genie's legs began to tremble slightly, while her arms twitched from time to time. The genie held her breath, hoping this would end soon. Amanda leaned a little towards her to watch the subtle growth of her breasts, rounding out to the size of her own mounds. Both women could hear the noise of her stretching top was getting lower, while at the same time the slight swelling became harder to notice. Eventually Amanda couldn't see or hear anything anymore, but the stressed look on the genie's face told her she was still feeling something. Her top then stretched again, and her bosom bulged once more as the spirit took in a deep breath. Both her bust and the fabric slowly relaxed again as the genie let out a long sigh. With her uncovered eye the genie looked down on her master. "Okay, so much for the opening act", she said, dry and monotone as ever. "Next I guess you wanna step on the stage?"  
  
With big eyes and an open mouth Amanda stared at the genie's breasts, before taking a glance down at her own. Putting the skin colour and the clothes they were wrapped into aside their bosoms were pretty much identical in shape, size and structure. Amanda cupped her ample assets, feeling that electric tingle again. A devious smile formed on her face, startling the genie a little started as well the sparkle behind her master's glasses. "Not so fast!", she told the genie. She removed her hands from her chest, proudly sticking it out from her body. "Instead of a solo, why not make it a duet this time?"  
  
The whole body of the genie stiffened. "Um, what exactly do you mean by duet?", she asked.  
  
Amanda chuckled. "Can't you guess?"  
  
"I can, but I'm clinging to the straw I may have misunderstood you." Looking down on her master she was met with and intimidating glare. "Fine, fine, I get it", she sighed, raising her arms. "As thy�"  
  
"Wait!" Amanda took a side of her blouse in each hand, and forcefully pulled the fabric over her cleavage. It took her a lot of effort, but one by one she closed up all the buttons until none of her bosom was exposed anymore. The white fabric was lying taught around her breasts, accenting every single curve. Just from holding them like this her blouse looked like it could blow open any moment. "Okay, now you can go!", Amanda chirped, her top creaking as she made a small hop while crossing her arms behind her back.  
  
This time the genie rolled her eyes, shook her head and sighed all at the same time. "As I was about say", she began once more, putting her hands into position. "As thy wish!"  
  
The jugs of the genie jiggled as she clapped her hands. The moment the sound reached Amanda's ears she could feel the magic hitting her body. As it engulfed her Amanda closed her eyes. Subtle tingles went over her skin as the spell moved through her, slowly wandering towards her chest. She took in a deep breath, the taut fabric of her blouse groaning as her breasts pressed against it. While the young art student delightfully savored the sensation of her bosom being filled with magic the genie was less pleased as the same happened to her, and frowned in dismay. Simultaneously then both women felt the flesh in their orbs were arching against their tops. Amanda's lips rose to a wide smile as she watched the taut fabric of her blouse stretching, pulling on the buttons, while the genie's reaction upon seeing the neckline of her tank-top sliding down her protruding perkers was a simple snort.   
  
Feeling its struggle against the confining fabric Amanda ran her hands over her bosom. She could feel her blouse being stretched, being spread across the growing surface of her breasts. A small V-neck popped up as the highest open button was pushed gradually deeper, enlarging bit by bit. With the pressure on her buttons rising the fabric between them was gradually pulled aside. Small gaps appeared that showed fragments of cleavage, the little excerpts slowly extending to show the skin on the inner slopes of her breasts. Without much space to grow into they pressed against each other with rising force, steadily eliminating any room that was still between them. Over the rim of her the fabric small folds began to rise up from her bust, its tops steadily ascending upwards while the rest was trapped inside her blouse. Though they kept their firm appearance the increasing pressure made them lose a bit of their roundness, the parts that were free sticking out further than the rest. The seam that held her highest button suddenly popped, making the little plastic knob fly several feet through the room. The very second it burst off her breasts surged forward and got a little closer to an evenly spherical shape. With one button gone her cleavage went past the middle of her breasts, showing a gored amount of her bright skin. Having conquered some more space they bounced up and down, seemingly celebrating its victory in this battle. It hid for a few second the "war" that was still going on, but as their jumping subsided one could clearly see again how desperately her breasts tried to outgrow the tight top. Smiling as she felt her bosom squeezing against the cotton Amanda absorbed every single tingle going through her body that was created by the sensation of growth and the increasing sensitivity in her assets. She rose to her tip-toes, watching her orbs jiggle slightly already from the simple move. When she put her feet back on the ground they made a solid bounce, not very much, but the up and down movement rubbed her assets enough over her blouse that it made the young woman shiver in pleasure while a soft moan made its way out of her mouth.   
  
The scene played out pretty much the same for the genie, with only two differences: First was of course was the top. As her humps spread out to all directions, growing into gradually bigger spheres she felt the purple fabric getting wrapped around the fronts of her breasts. Meanwhile her neckline slid deeper and deeper, revealing her dark-skinned bosom bit by bit. The part of her breast gap that was still hidden underneath her top began to suck in the fabric, showing the firm curvature of her assets. Her shirt also was pulled forward at the sides, so the armholes were widening as well, getting stretched into an oval shape. That way the flanks of her breasts were getting revealed, showing the part of them that sprouted out from her chest wall. The bigger they became the clearer the vaulting slopes could be distinguished from the rest of her body. As the sides and the tops of her bosom got revealed the hem of her top also was lifted upwards as well, uncovering her belly, while the holders cut deeper and deeper into her shoulders. Aside from how her top shrunk around her bosom the second difference between Amanda's and the genie's growth was her reaction: While Amanda was squealing in joy and softly stroke the tips of her fingers over her taut blouse the genie had her hands on her hips, observing anxiously as flesh flowed out of her chest. Seeing the swells of her breasts spilling out of her top and closer towards her face uneased her, even though it was her own magic that had caused this. But that why she worried: Since it was her spell she knew very well how far it would go. And as she knew her master wouldn't be satisfied with anything that was even close to moderate, she had set the bar pretty high this time�   
  
Despite being taken in by her breasts Amanda somehow noticed it as the genie gulped. She paused her soft caressing for a moment, a short wave of guilt overcoming her. Making the genie grow her bust was one thing. But now she was forcing her to do the same with her own body. Her remorse however was cut short as a sudden thought made brought a mischievous smile to the young woman's dace. Maybe she just needed some "help" to enjoy the situation?  
  
Both women's breasts were about to outgrow the size of their heads. As the genie watched the very top of her breasts getting on height with her lower neck she suddenly heard the voice of her master. "Come down here!", Amanda demanded. The genie who had been floating in the middle of the room the entire time raised her stare from her bust. The huge smile of Amanda left no doubts about her intentions, so the spirit just looked at her in annoyance. "Come on, or do I have to wish for it?", Amanda asked, lifting her hands from her breasts as she crossed her arms below them. This led the top of her bosom to spill out some more over the rim of her cleavage. After staring at her master some more the genie sighed in defeat. She lowered her body a little, flying down towards Amanda. "Closer!", she could hear her say. The genie approached her further until her knees were on eye-height with her and roughly two feet away from her face. "Closer�" Grunting the spirit came down a little more. Her navel was on height with Amanda's head, and above it the genie's bosom cast a shadow on her hair. "Almost there", Amanda smirked. Finally the genie gave up: She floated a bit backwards, brought her body down until their busts were aligned (she had to bend her legs so her feet wouldn't touch the ground) and then moved her body forward until the front of her breasts graced Amanda's taut blouse. Their swelling mammary melons pressed the stretching fabric of their tops against other, both women's bust slowly evening the other's front. "Symmetrical docking!", Amanda chirped. She hopped on her feet, the bounces of her bosom motivating the genie's to jiggle slightly.   
  
The genie was not amused.  
  
Another button broke off from Amanda's top. Instead of flying to the ground however it jumped right up into the cleavage of the genie, vanishing inside the deep abyss of dark breast flesh. And with each of their breasts being as large as a small volleyball it had plenty to sink into. Once more Amanda's V-neck extended, going down to the middle of her bust as only two more buttons held her blouse closed around her growing assets, though another one was slowly getting pulled up. With the gaps between the buttons widening and ever more flesh spilling over the rim of her cleavage the amount of exposed skin quickly increased, especially since the transparence of the white fabric made it steadily shine through. As they swelled against the genie's breasts they put each other's tops under additional strain, the bulging fronts stretching the material. The four spheres squeezed against each other, still not sagging despite sporting a quite respectable amount of tissue. Getting squashed by each other and being trapped by their tops though they were hindered in their forward movement, leading the flesh to pile up on the sides. The tops of their bosom had reached their necks and were going for their chins while they were so wide they could be even seen from behind by that point. The genie felt the hem of her top moving over the top of her belly towards her breasts. Reaching the bottom of their slopes it slowly wandered up, revealing cleavage from below. At the same time her top showed a wide amount of skin through the armholes and the neck of her tank-top while its shoulder-straps were almost as thin as the holders of a bikini. After uncovering a rough sixth of her breasts from below the movement of the hem came to a halt as it got stuck between the two women's racks. The luscious mounds around the size of big basketballs were squeezing with so much force against each other it pushed the genie a little backwards in the air. Looking straight down it looked for her as if her own cleavage would directly flow into that of her master. Again a button broke off Amanda's shirt, bounced off from the taut fabric of the genie's top and was shot back into the depths of Amanda's enlarged cleavage. Due to being stuck between the two women's busts her V-neck didn't open as much as it could, only adding a thin tip to the V-shaped excerpt on her breasts. Still, with some pressure being released they wobbled slightly, the quivering of her meat luring a giggle out of Amanda, which caused it to jiggle some more. "Would you calm down please?", the genie asked, feeling every vibration of Amanda's jugs in her own.  
  
Instead of stopping Amanda chuckled even louder. Her constant giggling made the last button on her chest pop off and jump into the genie's under cleavage. "Calm down?", she repeated, grinning from ear to ear. "But the fun part is just about to start!"   
  
Suddenly Amanda threw her arms on the sides of the genie's bosom. The spirit gasped in surprise as she felt her master's hands on the bare parts of her swelling curves, at the ridiculously enlarged armholes of her top. Their buoyant flesh slowly grew into Amanda's palms, increasing the tightness of the grip. "H-hey, let go you perverted punk!", she screamed.   
  
"No chance", Amanda smirked. While their busts continued to bulge against each other, putting their tops to the ultimate stress-test she pressed her fingers into the dark mammaries. The genie opened her mouth, but quickly closed it before she could make any embarrassing sound. Giggling Amanda released the pressure on the genie's breasts, feeling the squeezed meat relax beneath her hands. For a moment the spirit seemed like she was about to sigh in relief. It was cut off by another gasp however as Amanda suddenly drove her fingers back into the billowing flesh, only to let go again and repeat. In a more or less rhythmically manner she kneaded the genie's breasts, pressing her fingers in and out in what could best be called an amateurish massage. The ancient being bit her lips, obviously holding back a moan as Amanda was fondling her. She wasn't the only one getting aroused by this though, for the masseur herself found the act of ploughing her hands through the succulent and exotic breasts of the genie rather exciting as well. Closing her eyes she grabbed the genie's rack harder. Her tongue fell out of her mouth, hanging from her lips, and Amanda increased her groping speed. The more intense she fondled the harder it was for the genie to contain herself. She pressed her quivering lips together, winced slightly as sensation after sensation went through her, and tried to keep her shivers under control. With both women being distracted they didn't hear as the fabric of their clothes began to exceed their limits. Amanda's blouse that had risen over her belly was ripping horizontally at the lower sides of her breasts. Swelling against them her bosom slowly enlarged the thin tears, making them wider and longer as stitch after stitch dissolved and popped. Almost at the same time the genie's tank-top was breaking in the middle, extending her cleavage, while the first threats on the holders started to give in. The edges of the tears were adorned with some unclean frilly, fine strands of fabric sticking out. As the fabric on the front was still sandwiched between the two women's bosoms, squeezing with such force against each other they were almost compressed to half-spheres both Amanda and the genie felt the rim of the rifts stroking their bare breast skin. Another hole then appeared on Amanda's blouse, on the right breast right above the other. Soon a counterpart was born on the other side, before another tear appeared on her left breast, near her V-neck. On the widest parts of her breasts the fabric was stretching into transparence, the holes between the stitches becoming visible as they widened. Amanda's whole body trembled, her hands especially shaking in arousal as they worked on the genie's breasts. "Oh god, this feels so good!", she cooed, raising her head as her breasts reached her chin.  
  
Goose-bumps were forming all over the genie's body. Trying to ignore the sensations the growth and Amanda's hands caused she looked down on herself to estimate their sizes, but all she saw was black cleavage. Still, with the ridiculous sensitivity of her assets she could feel the rough dimensions of her breasts, and guessed them around beach balls size. "Don't� don't you think this is enough?", she panted. She had a feeling though what the answer would be, and was confirmed as her master just giggled. While her top continued to rip downwards, exposing more and more of her cleavage and breast flesh three tears almost appeared simultaneously below it. Lying horizontally above each other they extended towards the sides, quickly growing from small eye-shaped rips to large rifts, their ends on height with her breast warts. After her breasts shredded some more of her top in their growth the rip on the end of her d�collet� fused with the highest of those tears. The ripped up ends of the fabric flowed over their curves as they bulged forward, her cleavage extending below the widest of her bust. Shortly after and the fabric that separated the two lower tears also broke, turning them into one big gap. Her breasts flared out a little more and brought the edges of the tear into a round shape, creating an oval hole. With that only two thin strands of fabric kept the genie's top from getting split in half. Two thin strands and the pressure that had built up between hers and Amanda's breasts. And even though she had been constantly pushed back the pressure was very high, their busts being reduced by at least a quarter of their actual diameter. They reached down to their belly buttons while spilling up to their faces while being almost twice as wide as they were from shoulder to shoulder. The genie was tempted to fly back completely, but was afraid her top would really blow apart if she made such a move. Then again, it would break sooner or later anyway, and this way she might get off the groping hands of her master. Still, she decided to stay and endure it, her dark complexion becoming a little red as she fought back the urge to moan.  
  
Amanda, who had a lot less decency, when the genie started to make some weak sounds that could be interpreted as moans she was already roaring all the lust out of her lunges. Her top hadn't fared any better than the genie's as constantly more rips had appeared. They weren't running perfectly parallel to each other like the genie's, but all had the same rough shape of an oval with sharp ends in varying sizes. Through each tear her bulging bosom tried to squeeze into freedom, bubbles of meat ascending and enlarging the tears as they grew out of the fabric. The first holes already started to unite, fusing into strange forms before they ripped back into an oval shape. Only the fabric that was tucked between the growing bosoms of the two ladies didn't tear as fast for the pressure kept it from moving. They were mashed together with such force the buttons that had been pulled up over her bust and had actually broke off already, were held in position as well as the fabric of the blouse itself. Still though, even with what they were hiding behind each other's racks, the cover of the two women was getting rather sparse. While the genie's tank-top still survived fairly at the sides, even though it was stretched so much the fabric only covered a little amount of skin, Amanda's blouse had gotten pretty much redundant: What wasn't behind the genie's bust could be practically gazed at without any hindrance, wide gaps in her top showing bright breast beef en galore. Under loud ripping and shredding the remaining hideout for her bosom bit by bit dispersed. As it had shrunken to a thin network of threads Amanda suddenly heard a loud rip coming from the genie's top. She interrupted her massage and moaning, though her body urged for more, and quickly leaning up to watch it break.   
  
To be more precisely, it were six rips that happened simultaneously she had heard. While the genie gasped loudly the holders of her top both broke apart, as well as the fabric below her armholes of her top which had been stretched to less than half of its original size. At the same time the already ripped up cleavage that was tucked between hers and Amanda's bosom split apart completely. With that her top was basically broken into three pieces, and none of it was covering her breasts. Unbound the chocolate-coloured spheres flared out to the diameter of hula hoops, the massive piles of flesh wobbling slightly as they broke free and throwing Amanda's hands off them. Their tops were above her nose, almost blocking the genie's entire sight and her master's view on her face, while their bottom was on height with her waist. Together her spheres were three times wider than herself, while the front of her breasts was at least six feet away from the rest of her torso. The genie's uncovered eye widened as she stared at the true bulk of her bosom, the spirit being more breast than anything. "Oh dammit!", she shouted, floating back from Amanda and higher into the air.  Her deformed breasts spread out to an evenly spherical shape, sending small wobbles through them. She pulled her arms as far around her giant globes as she could, but the tips of her fingers barely could reach past their widest parts. Though her ethereal body had no trouble carrying them the genie leaned forward a little, making her abnormal bust hang slightly down from her.  
  
As the genie had moved away there was no hold anymore for Amanda to lean against. The moment the genie's front left hers and released the pressure from her colossal chest it dragged her forward. Her blouse shred further into nothingness as she fell, not even trying to fight for balance in her form. As she hit the ground her top was completely gone from her front, leaving her giant bosom exposed and the rest of her body wobbling on it. The sheer size of her humps kept her body relatively straight, but she was ore kneeling than standing, even though her knees didn't touch the ground. In an awkward position Amanda rested on her breasts, feeling as the ongoing growth slowly pushed her further upwards. With each second that passed the breasts of the two women grew larger, Amanda's entire body steadily vanishing behind hers. Their fronts were pushed apart by their rounding insides, making them point into different directions. By then beach balls were no adequate comparison anymore to describe the size of the two women's assets, each being vast enough to work as a bean bag chair. The genie looked up from her abyssal cleavage over the giant slopes flesh that blocked her entire sight, while feeling them glide away beneath her arms that couldn't even reach half around them anymore. "Oh come one, you can't tell me you think this is still attractive?", she shouted.  
  
The grounded Amanda also inspected her giant rack, the magnitude of mammary tissue packed together into a pair of perfectly globular spheres which were swelling into increasingly insane dimensions. With the utmost delicacy she run her hands over her curves, up and down, left and right, as far as she could stretch her arms and as close as she could get them to her body. She even drowned them into her canyon-cleavage, letting the bulging inner sides of her breasts swallow her arms. As she moved her hands over her sensitive skin she believed to feel every individual cell of her of her breasts, every single square getting rubbed and stroked. "No, I don't think this is attractive", she told the genie. With a dumb grin she whispered: "I think that's fucking hot!" She tightened the grip on her bosom. The hormones rushed through her body as all remaining parts of her mind that were responsible for reasonable behavior were shut off. Moans were thrown out of Amanda's mouth, one after another, in a steadily quicker succession, while she pressed her hands as deeply into her flesh as she could, fondling it in a berserk-like trance.  
  
The genie didn't respond or react to this, for her breasts were surpassing even large tractor wheels in diameter and she could no longer see anything in front of her but cleavage. Clapping her hands before her chest was of course impossible, but even trying to do it them under her bust would be a difficult task. She grunted. Her mood was only slightly lifted by the fact the growth was starting to subside: The pressure between the round walls of her cleavage increased at a slower pace, and she felt her curves' overall swelling was decreasing. Once her breasts stuck out from her as a pair of giant, almost weather balloon-sized spheres she could finally see no more signs of expansion on her cleavage. Shortly afterwards the constant moaning that filled the room grew quite, indicating Amanda was also done growing and� stuff. Unable to see her master from her current position the genie tilted her body forward so she was "lying" on her belly. Her breasts bounced up and down (or rather forth and back from her point of view), rubbing over and clapping against each other, but despite their massiveness they hung down as a pair of firm and round globes, almost gracing the carpet on the floor. "Alright, all "fun" aside I hope you are aware of the consequences your wish has?", the genie asked, looking at Amanda.  
  
Though she couldn't see anything of her but breasts.  
  
Exhausted Amanda was leaning against her ginormous bust. The white-skinned orbs of the art student were pretty much the same size as those of the genie. Any difference there might have been between them, maybe one or two inches in width, was diminutive in the dimensions they of them had achieved. The genie could only roughly see the hands of Amanda stroking the sides of her bosom softly � as far as she could reach them � and stretching her neck could spot her head. Her right cheek was resting in the vast sink between her breasts, cuddling them gently. Amanda raised her face a little from its "nest", though she couldn't see much of the genie beyond the horizon her bust created. "What?", she asked. "I can make them smaller anytime, or wish for enough strength to carry them� or do you mean I get older because I have birthday every day?" Amanda giggled. "So what? It's just one year per day! Small price for big boobs, if you ask me!" Smiling she let her face sink onto the top of her seemingly infinite cleavage again. The tender skin of her assets responded with a tingle as she rubbed her cheek over the inner slopes of her cleavage, while at the same time she ran her arms softly over her smooth curves.   
  
As she caressed herself however, it felt like the surface of her bosom was changing under her hands, getting rougher, Harder to stroke. Amanda frowned. Suddenly she realised it wasn't the surface of her bosom that was changing, but her hands. Before her own eyes she could watch as wrinkles appeared everywhere on her arm, getting deeper and more numerous per second. Soon she felt them appearing everywhere on her body, her legs, face, neck � the only part of her spared where her breasts, which seemed increasingly misplaced on Amanda as they stayed round, firm and smooth while the rest of her skin became rougher and sloppier by the second. "W-what?", Amanda asked, but immediately put a hand over her mouth as she heard her own voice: It sounded different from usual. Croaked. Hoarse. Like that of her grandmother.  
  
That was when it hit Amanda: She was turning into an old woman.  
  
"H-h-hey!", she shouted. Or at least tried to, but it sounded more like a loud whisper. "Why am I turning into an old hag?" She noticed her hair was becoming white and ruffled, and her sight was getting a little blurry. Still, she could imagine the grin on the genie's face(even though in truth the corners of her mouth didn't move).  
  
"Well no one said I had to go by them at order", the spirit explained. "Today's your 90th birthday. I think tomorrow I will make it your fourth birthday, the day after that your 52nd, and if I'm generous I may make it your 26th birthday the day after that."   
  
Amanda coughed, feeling as year after year was added to her age. Her skin was rough and full of wrinkles all around her body, her sight was diminishing until she was almost blind even with her glasses, her hair bleached out, and she was even shrinking. Eventually she became a short 90-year old woman with bleak straw-like hair, an excessively wrinkled face � and a pair of perfectly round and smooth breasts, each larger than herself. "You� you tricked me!", she panted, her voice barely audible.  
  
A smile crept over the genie's stern face. "Shocking, isn't it?" She crossed her arms above her massive cleavage and rested her chin on them, watching in glee as her master tried to move in her old weak body. "That's what you get for trying to outsmart a genie!", she giggled, sticking out her tongue.

Oh, I don't know, It could be fun if Amanda wished the genie would learn to enjoy it...  
And yes, a wish to be 18-25 years old forever seems to be in order.

I would agree with many of the other readers. I personally prefer a more jubilant ending rather than a dark twist, with a synical bit of humor at the end to compliment, but still positive and sexy nonetheless.

Loved this story, mostly because I'm a big fan of female genie+expansion stories. The end had an interesting and unexpected twist (a bit of a turn off though). Hope Amanda will get back at the genie. Also, I'm concerned about her "every day-birthday" wish. What happens when she runs out of birthdays?

Good question. Maybe they'll just start over again? Or Amanda wishes for eternal life? Or the genie just assumes Amanda will get over 1000 years old^^

I think it would be wise of her to wish to be eternally in her prime years, so the genie would have a harder time twisting the wish. Doubtful that she'd like to have a large chest on the body she had at the end forever.

Nice story, will you continue it? Also, is the genie not allowed to directly kill her master? Finally, if her master was gone, but never wished the genie's breasts away, would she have to keep them until someone else wished them away, or could she get rid of them anyway?

Thank you ![:)](./I3reacl_files/smile.gif ":) (Smile)") I will most likely write a sequel one day, but it will probably take while before I start working on it.  
  
I don't know, and haven't thought about it yet. I make up the rules for the genies as they are needed. So as long as this questions aren't relevant for the plot I'm afraid I must leave them unanswered.

Awesome story! This was a really fun read, with loads of great humour thoughout. The Genie's snarky reactions to Amanda's lunacy were pure gold every time.   
And of course, the growth scene was excellent.

[:iconfaestock:](http://faestock.deviantart.com/) `[faestock](http://faestock.deviantart.com/) is one of our best known and popular deviants from the Stock and Resources community. Her gallery is filled to the brim with high quality stock photographs that have inspired deviants to get creative, and turn the already beautiful images into something magical. Jessica always takes time to reach out to deviants, providing contests and nurturing other artists. We're inspired by her selfless attitude and dedication to a genre that we couldn't create without. It's with great pleasure that we award the Deviousness Award for September 2013 to `[faestock](http://faestock.deviantart.com/), congratulations.  [Read More](http://today.deviantart.com/)

**More Milk for More Maidens**"Aren't you done changing yet, April?", Victoria yelled from the kitchen. As her younger co-worker didn't reply she sighed. "Man, first day in our first job, and she can't even get into her uniform." Lowering her green eyes the tall girl looked at the clothes she wore: A short black dress alongside a white apron and matching boots. There was also a white maiden's cap tucked into her short crimson hair. "The chief maiden will be here any moment", she mumbled. "Said something about a "special test" on the phone. And that butler just gave us our uniforms and told us to go straight into the kitchen once we have changed � the rich surely are](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/More-Milk-for-More-Maidens-201845822) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**A Hardware Upgrade**Since she was a child Jean had always loved flying. Though it was over twenty years ago she could still remember the first time when she had entered a plane. She was so nervous she had hold tightly to the arm of her mother the entire time on the airport, and once they sat inside immediately grabbed the leans of her seat. When the plane took off she almost screamed, and couldn't calm down until the signs for the seatbelts had gone off. But as she dared a look outside the window after a while and stared at the sea of white fluffy clouds and the beautiful landscape beneath the plane all her fear was immediately replaced with utter awe.

**Bikini Body**"Okay, I've added the cat-ears. Now, do you think I'd look better with a bunny nose or a bird beak?" The 22-year old college girl shifted a little on her couch so she could hold her pencil better, while making a few alterations on the semi-anthropomorphic sketch of herself. Between her right shoulder and ear she was holding a telephone from which she impatiently awaited a reply. Meanwhile, the other occupant of the couch looked up at her with a similarly impatient look in her eyes. "I swear I've already fed you twice today, Mitty", she told her begging pet.  All the black cat responded was "meow" before getting up and jumping off th](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Bikini-Body-251846519)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**In retrospect...**Sarah stared into her glass, blushing slightly. With the straw she drew circles on the surface of her juice, nervously shifting around on her chair. �Sooo, how do you feel?", she asked, not looking up from her glass.  
  
�Like a milk-cow", the woman next to her said. Around them, Sarah could hear the whispers of the other guests at the street caf�, constantly glaring over to their table. People passing on the street gazed towards them, their eyes nearly popping out of their heads. �You know, one of those genetically modified with the fat udders."  
  
Silently, Sarah took a sip from her orange juice � coincidentally, &#](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/In-retrospect-202581465)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**A Witchy Accident**"Lalala-lala~♪"  
  
The lovely voice of a young lady echoed through the bathroom, filling it with a cheerful melody. Inside a full bathtub the source of the music, a young woman in her early twenties was taking a bath, chirping this little tune while she thoroughly rubbed some foam over her leg. The water pearled off her skin as she stretched her leg into the air, reflecting the light of the ceiling lamp and the full moon that was shining through the window. "Ah, there's nothing like a hot bath", the woman sighed. The tips of her purple hair sunk into the water as she put her head back a little and glided a little deeper into the bathtub.](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/A-Witchy-Accident-272934324) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**The genie from the milk bottle**There weren't many people who could open a door with their feet, but Amanda was one of them.  
  
Holding the key between her toes the young woman put it into the keyhole, bending a little backwards. She had to be careful nothing would fall out of the box she was carrying in her arms. �That was a good day", she said to herself, looking at all the plastic items, cans and other garbage she had collected. �I can make a lot out of this stuff!"  
  
With little effort she tilted the key around, opening the door. Her apartment looked like one would expect it from a 24-year old woman, maybe a bit larger than the average. The greatest difference be](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/The-genie-from-the-milk-bottle-196457100)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Milk for a Maiden**"Man, what an old-fashioned uniform!", May sighed, glancing at her black house-maiden dress and white apron. In her long, curly hair, she wore a white maiden cap, while black high-heels and white socks covered her feet. "Well, at least the skirt is short." Cleaning the kitchen table, the brunette then saw a bottle of milk. "Hey, milk!", she said, grabbing the bottle. "If my new boss pays me so lousy, he can't complain if I drink some of his milk." Opening it, she emptied the bottle with a few gulps, ignoring the warning label "FROM GENETICALLY MODIFIED COWS � MAY CAUSE SWELLINGS ON SOME PERSONS".  
  
Just as she put the bottle down again, M](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Milk-for-a-Maiden-166103544)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Levy's Request**"M-master, do you have a moment?"  
  
Makarov, the third master of the mage guild Fairy Tail, turned around. One of his guild's younger mages, Levy McGarden, was standing behind him, looking rather nervous. She wasn't a very tall girl � of course way taller than the tiny old guild master � with blue shoulder-length hair and an orange bandana inside it. Her cropped sleeveless top was wide open, showing the yellow bikini top and silver necklace she wore, while short white jeans held by a brown belt covered her thighs. On her feet she wore a pair of sandal-like high heels, and two ankle chains decorated each of her legs. "Sure, Levy", he](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Levy-s-Request-207655326) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**L.A.S.A.S.A**Legend of the Attractive Shinobi Apprentice Shimanto Ayumi  
  
Slowly, Ayumi got closer to her opponent, careful not to make any noise. Sneaking up to the armored guard, the ninja girl carefully pulled out a shuriken from her weapon bag - three meters, and she would be in range. The moon shone down on the Japanese mansion, bathing the garden in its silver light. Ayumi was covered by the shadow of a building, her slender, but still female figure only vaguely visible. Two meters - she checked once more if no other guard could see her on the bridge. Luckily, they were either all inside the mansion or too far away. One meter. Pulling back her arm, s](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/L-A-S-A-S-A-160108905)

**A Demon's Desire**"Excuse me."  
  
Pandora turned to look at the girl who talked to her. She was a very pretty girl, but also quite strange. Her hair was long and curly, but it was dark green, and her eyes were the same color. She also wore a short green sundress, but that was a lighter shade. Her ears were slightly longer than normal, but they were pointed as well. She was flat-chested and thin, but her lower body was perfectly shaped and very sexy. The girl was tiny and shy. "Are you Phoenix?" she continued in her small voice.  
  
"They call me that, yeah," Pandora answered, smiling. She was equally beautiful, with blonde hair styled much like that of the tiny gir](http://xphoenixflare.deviantart.com/art/A-Demon-s-Desire-195762701)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**You're Not Alone**"Yeah, see ya."  
  
Marley cheerfully made her way to her dorm room, her enormous, exercise-ball-sized breasts bouncing merrily and her basketball-sized butt swaying hypnotically as she walked. Her bushy red hair flew behind her as if a light breeze was blowing through the hallway, and her fox tail waggled back and forth happily. The look was completed by a pair of adorable fox ears, enchanting emerald eyes, and one of the prettiest faces in all of Morasia. She wore a simple black t-shirt, jeans, and sneakers.  
  
She squeezed through the door to her dorm room, where her roommate Becca was waiting for her. Her fellow redhead smiled when the fox gir](http://xphoenixflare.deviantart.com/art/You-re-Not-Alone-203740530)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**April's Big Day**April's Big Day  
  
April was cleaning around the house since she was going to have company over today. She had met a woman named Sabrina not very long ago, and had invited her over for lunch. April figured it'd be a good way to get to know more about Sabrina.  
  
Two of April's friends, Clara and Katrina, had introduced her to Sabrina the other day. The cool thing about Clara and Katrina was that they were witches, and could pretty much do anything they wanted; they were also twins.  
  
April had to admit though, that she did have this one thought about kissing Clara; she wondered what it'd be like. Clara was extremely cute and was ve](http://blueberryjanelle.deviantart.com/art/April-s-Big-Day-191673895)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Operation Covert BE Pt 2** The girls were dragged down into the lower levels of the facility, their tired legs banging against the steps as they went. The guards turned in front of one of the empty holding cells, indifferent since all others were apparently empty, and laid the exhausted maidens down in the room. The guards left the room, one of them pressing keys on a control panel, activating a shining wall of light, separating the girls and the guards. Savanna looked at the guards, a tired, but angry expression on her face, as they turned and left the girls in their new chamber.

Part Two  
  
We all watched as Sabrina's breasts started growing; slowly but surely, her shirt's wrinkles smoothed out as her chest was making itself known. Sabrina always had nice pair of breasts; she loved to show them off whenever she could, and loved the attention she got when people drooled over them, especially her cleavage. She took care of her body, which was why Sabrina got so many eyes looking in her direction. She was very beautiful.  
  
Sabrina wasn't the type to call people names, or make fun of them because they didn't look as pretty. Sometimes she'd joke around, but she honestly had no intentions of](http://blueberryjanelle.deviantart.com/art/Busty-Desires-Part-Two-207960046)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Growing Patience**Growing Patience  
  
I had recently purchased a new product that was being sold, and the person who consumed it would, in theory, grow "bigger." Of course, I had to try it. How could I pass it up?  
  
My boyfriend, Brad, was still at work so the house was to myself for about another hour until he got back. I figured this would be the perfect time to try this new "product" that I had heard so much about. I walked over and reached into my purse, "Ah, here it is. For fifteen dollars, this stuff better work."  
  
I walked over into the living room and took off the cap to the bottle. The bottle wasn't very big at all, and reminded me of one of those sm](http://blueberryjanelle.deviantart.com/art/Growing-Patience-209140234)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)

"Well, duh! We told you we'd come," Kylie rolled her eyes. "And besides, we're not like you where you just randomly show up at our houses at the most unexpected times...."  
  
Katrina's eyes looked up at Kylie, "What's that supposed to mean."  
  
"Well, both you and Clara do that. Just teleport to places randomly."  
  
"Yeah, I remember you two teleported to my bathroom when I was in the shower," I chuckled and my cheeks turned a little red.](http://blueberryjanelle.deviantart.com/art/Busty-Desires-Part-One-206953017)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)

"I'm going into the kitchen to grab a bite to eat, and make Katrina a sandwich. You need anything?"  
  
"No thanks, Clara. I'm good."  
  
Clara nodded and walked off into the kitchen. Kylie walked to the Potion Room where she found Katrina muttering to herself as she poured liquid into a big round cauldron that was in the center of the room.  
  
Katrina grabbed a bottle off the shelf and walked up to the cauldron. She looked at the bottle in her hand, and thought to herself for a moment. She must have calculated something in her mind, Kylie thought.

**Tale of the sexy ninja girl**It was a dark night somewhere in the ancient Japan. Carefully, Ayumi peeked out of the small bush she had chosen as her hideout. A few hundred feet ahead of her was the castle she had to infiltrate, the only way inside being a well guarded gate. The young ninja quickly crawled out of the bush, sneaking towards a nearby tree. Before she could hide behind it though she accidentally tripped over one of its roots, and fell onto her face. Cursing at the moonless night she hastily checked if the guards had heard her.

 It was a dark night somewhere in the ancient Japan. Carefully, Ayumi peeked out of the small bush she had chosen as her hideout. A few hundred feet ahead of her was the castle she had to infiltrate, the only way inside being a well guarded gate. The young ninja quickly crawled out of the bush, sneaking towards a nearby tree. Before she could hide behind it though she accidentally tripped over one of its roots, and fell onto her face. Cursing at the moonless night she hastily checked if the guards had heard her. Once she was sure nobody had taken notice of her presence Ayumi covered behind the tree, while taking an old paper scroll from her weapon belt. �All right, here we go!", she said, opening the scroll.   
  
A bright light emerged from the ancient writing, steaming into her body. As the glowing subsided, Ayumi felt a comfortable warmth building up in her chest. Leaning against the tree she felt her form-fitting ninja suit growing even tighter around her breasts, her moderate curves slowly expanding inside it. Dropping the scroll Ayumi watched her bosom reach out from her body, feeling pleasurable tingles all over herself. Blowing up like balloons her perky breasts gradually shaped up, her tight clothes underlining their rounding form. The black fabric was soundly stretched over her bulging bust, Ayumi's skin prickling slightly from the sensation the rising pressure created. She rolled her brown eyes up to the sky, staring at the leaves above her, while the bandages tied around her chest grew tighter by the second. The young ninja shook her knees as her bosom's sensitivity increased with each gram it gained, her breath going hard and fast.  
  
'God, when will I get used to this?', she thought. Feeling ever hotter Ayumi's cheeks were glowing bright red behind her black banana, sweat forming on her burning forehead. As she glanced down her breasts she saw them reaching the measurements of small fruits, the modest domes firmly pointing off from her body. Closing her eyes she then felt their soft flesh flowing through the gaps between her bandages, creating some folds on her outfit. Ayumi pressed her back against the tree as she rubbed her butt over the hard bark, her bandana swallowing a small moan. She tried just to be so calm the guards wouldn't hear her, but otherwise did little to push back her growing excitement: Putting her hands around her breasts she let them grow into her cupped palms, the resulting sensation giving her shivering goose-bumps. Carefully, she pressed her fingers a little bit into her prospering bustline, only to bite her lips as she had to choke a gasp. Her bandages slowly dissolved, allowing her breasts to grow faster the less her old-fashioned support held them back.   
  
Overtaking grapefruits her assets tore a hole into her way too tight suit, creating a small rift in the middle of her bosom. At first, one could only see white fabric inside it. But as her breasts kept growing the tear also extended, until eventually some cleavage appeared between the ripping bandages. With a loud snap the first one broke apart, boosting her breast-size, cleavage and arousal a bit. The sudden wave of pleasure led her to strengthen the grip on her bosom, which in result increased her sensation, and shortened the life-span of her remaining bandages. Moan after moan forced its way out of her throat as the bandages one by one broke apart, pushing a rising amount of tit flesh into her fondling fingers. The tear in her suit steadily widened under the curving of her figure, while her breasts flared over the sides of her figure. Ayumi's bust felt like it was boiling with pleasure, standing several inches off from her body as she gently rubbed over her massing mammaries.   
  
For a moment then, her whole body stood still, the only movements coming from her growing chest. With a loud rip all of her leftover bandages suddenly broke apart, jolting her bosom up to a tremendous E-cup. Some shreds flew out of her suit as the fabric almost ripped up to her neck, displaying a tight cleavage alongside a generous amount of her skin. As they were only minor supported her breasts jumped a little inside the black suit, damaging it further. Ayumi knew if she moaned now the noise would attract the guards, so she used all her will power to keep her mouth shut, while she dug her hands deeper into her bosom. Getting overwhelmed with sensations she was just about to rip her suit apart when the feeling of growth slowly decreased, until it completely left the ninja.  
  
Feeling exhausted Ayumi panted slightly, her hands still squishing her sensitive bosom. She took in a deep breath to gather herself, bloating up her bustline and tightening her cleavage, before she let the air stream out through her bandana again. Once she had calmed down Ayumi lowered her stare, examining her blown-up rack: She had done this a dozen times already, but she was every time stunned at how big and soft her breasts became, still remaining a firm form despite their heavy weight. Dropping her melonous tits she watched them jiggle inside her suit, slightly rubbing against each other. 'That could be better', she thought, pulling a small dagger from her weapon belt. Slowly, she sliced off a large part of the fabric, careful not to wound herself. When she was done her suit sported a clean V-neck, giving rich insight to her body while putting some pressure out of her cleavage. Ayumi jumped on the spot, gladly noticing her breasts now bounced a little higher. �That's more like it!", she giggled, putting her hands back on her bust. She leaned herself against the tree again, rubbing and groping herself for a few more seconds. Once she was satisfied Ayumi gave her breasts a keen slap, watching and feeling as her meaty mounds joyfully jiggled into every direction. �All right girls, time to get to work!", she joked. Not wanting to duck she kicked the ancient scroll up into her hand, putting it back on her belt as walked out of her cover.   
  
The gate of the castle was protected by two armored samurais, their faces hidden behind red masks. Both were holding lances in their hands, while one also wore a large sword on his belt. Like statues they were standing on each side of the gate, showing no signs of motion. Only their eyes moved a little as they caught a human shade stumbling towards the gate. �Who is there?", the guard with the sword shouted, both of them pointing their lances at the stranger. The person seemed to have trouble to keep balance, walking around like a drunken man before stopping a hundred feet in front of them. They could now identify the shade as a woman, though her body was hard to distinguish from the darkness. The only thing they could clearly see was her long blond ponytail swaying from side to side as she tried to stand still. �Come closer so we can see you!", one of the guards told her. �But slowly!" The woman did as she was told, carefully moving towards the gate. �Try anything funny and we will... we will... we..."  
  
The guard fell silent. As the woman came closer, the torches above the gate illuminated her top-heavy figure, their light reflecting on her bright skin. Seeing the results her body had on the two men Ayumi giggled, pointing her chest out just a bit more. �Excuse me, but could you repeat that?", she politely asked. With a straight back she slowly moved over towards the guards, her breasts bouncing with each step. All clumsiness seemed to have vanished from her walk as she approached the samurai with the sword, carelessly passing his lance. �I don't think I heard your right", she told him, putting on a seductive look.  
  
Ayumi could see the guard was shaking a little inside his armor, but he still tried to keep his calm. �I-I asked who you are!", he shouted again, trying not to look at her cleavage. Staring at the ground Ayumi leaned a bit closer to him, just so her breasts slightly brushed his armor.    
  
�Nobody special", she said, circling with her foot on the ground. �I'm just a fragile, young girl in search for a strong man who can protect me, so that I don't need to feel lonely anymore." Looking into his eyes she put a hand on the man's mask, leaning even closer against him.  �Especially during dark, scary nights like this."  
  
Not yet. She did not have him yet. Though he was visibly fighting with himself, the samurai was still clinging to his duty. Carefully Ayumi took the scroll from her weapon's belt, opening it just a bit. Closing her eyes the ninja felt its magic working on her, her breasts soon tingling all over again. The growth was too slow for the guard to notice, but he could feel through his armor the extra pounds of chest pressing against his body. �I-I'm sorry", he said, removing her hand from his mask. As he held her she could feel his arm was shaking, like the entire rest of his body. �Th-this is the castle of g-general Y-Y-Yagaba, a-and I have to tell you to l-leave."  
  
Ayumi opened the scroll a bit further. Her breasts were swelling inside her suit, widening her cleavage as the fabric was pushed over her curves. �Don't send me away!", she begged the guard. With little effort she freed her hand from his weak grip, softly putting his arm down as her breasts grew against his body. �It's soooooooo scary out here! Can't you let me just stay one night?"   
  
The guard gulped. �I-I'm afraid th-the fortress is f-full of imperial s-soldiers, so we don't h-have any b-beds l-left�"   
  
Leaning ever closer Ayumi pressed her breasts against the samurai, sandwiching them between their bodies. �That's no problem", she said in a soft and soothing voice. �Actually, I would feel much better if I would not sleep alone, but with a strong, powerful warrior lying by my side." Secretly she closed the scroll again, waiting until the last pounds of breast flesh had rolled out from her body. With gentle hands then she removed the mask of the samurai, seeing his face was just as dumb-struck and lecherous as she had imagined it to be. For a short moment, the young ninja felt slight disgust about what she was doing. Quickly Ayumi shook it off again, giving the guard another slinky glance. The poor man didn't even notice as she also removed the helmet from his head. �I also wouldn't mind if he lay on any other position of my body", she whispered into his ear. Dropping both the mask and the helmet she wrapped her arms around the samurai's neck. He was basically wax in her hands, making such a stupid face it was almost cute. With one hand Ayumi stroke his hair, his smile growing even dumper as her other hand slowly wandered down his body�  
  
Seeing the man was completely defenseless, Ayumi pulled a dagger from her belt and sliced up his throat.   
  
Quickly the ninja ducked under the fountain of blood streaming from his wound. Her heavy breasts nearly slammed her into the ground, Ayumi moving her body forth and back as she fought with her balance. As the corpse of the soldier landed one the ground she slowly straightened up again, holding her wobbling bosom with both hands. �Will I ever get used to this?", she mumbled, standing a little insecure on her legs. Sometimes, she wished the effects of the scroll weren't just temporary so that she could get more used to them, and wear clothes during missions which didn't feel painfully tight. After intense training she was at least able to walk around properly for a limited amount of time, but that rarely held longer than five minutes. Looking downwards Ayumi noticed her breasts had blown up to a solid FF-cup, her suit displaying a canyon of cleavage. �I hope the rest is easier to seduce", she sighed, turning away from the dead samurai.  
  
And then she saw the other one standing directly in front of her, pointing his lance at her face.  
  
�Um, hey!", she said, nervously looking at the iron peak in front of her eyes. �Any chance you would just let me pass and murder your general?" The guard didn't reply, but moved the tip of his lance towards her throat. �O-okay, no need to do something you might regret!", Ayumi quickly said, taking a step back as the samurai moved forward. She believed to feel her massive knockers pulsating, her heart-beat going up to her throat. �A-all right, let's make a deal!", she offered. Hastily she put her sweating hand on her belt, trying to get hold of the scroll. �If you let me leave alive, I'll give you something that will make sure you always have the most gorgeous-" Suddenly, just as she had grabbed it, Ayumi felt the scroll slipping away from her grip, watching in shock as it fell to the ground and completely opened itself. �Oh no�"    
  
Once more the letters on the scroll began to shine. The guard took a step back, still pointing his spear at Ayumi. But he was quite perplexed as he watched her own spears suddenly lancing through her suit, his eyes growing comically wide at the sight of her growing breasts and nipples. Ayumi could hear a slight hissing from her ninja suit, while at the same time the weight of her chest was dragging on her shoulders. Letting out a soft moan she felt the sensitivity of her breasts increase again, sending shivers and prickles through her body. Overtaking her head they pushed the fabric of her suit aside, extending her already bounteous cleavage. While her breasts almost soundly rubbed against each other, the rip in her suit slowly wandered lower, moving over her curves like a skier down a hill. The squeezing of her breasts and pressure inside her clothes �forced" Ayumi to put her hands back on her bosom, her own lustful screams sounding like distant echoes in her own ears as the ninja girl fondled her growing boobs.   
  
Sending pleasure after pleasure through herself Ayumi only barely noticed she was kneeling down a little as her legs couldn't support her chest's weight anymore. Growing into volley balls her firm roundings tore further on her suit. On the sides, one could see the fabric was slowly dissolving, turning from pitch black to a dark grey. The groping of her hands accelerated the process, though her deepening cleavage put some stress out of the suit. Once it had ripped down to the very end of her bosom however, her broad V-neck barely gracing her piercing nipples, it only took a few seconds before the first rip appeared on her right breast. Without thinking she pushed her hand into the small rift, and continued to massage her meat bun from inside it. Still growing fuller her bosom jiggled slightly as Ayumi suddenly slapped her left breast, creating another tear on her suit. Once the sensation had calmed down Ayumi �fingered" her other breast as well, causing Ayumi to moan loud enough for the the entire castle to hear her.      
  
As Ayumi approached basket balls the guard slowly began to snap out. Forcing a grim expression into his face (which couldn't be seen under his mask) he placed his spear in front of her nose. �Q-quit this nonsense!", he yelled. He could barely hear his own voice though under her intense moans as Ayumi ploughed her hands through her swelling flesh. Losing all balance she fell onto her knees, the pain of the impact only barely reaching her mind. Her ecstasy was slowly reaching its climax, while the rifts in her suit continued to grow under her rising curves. Pushing her hands deeply into her soft bosom she gathered her arousal for a short moment, before letting it all burst out in a wild scream of pleasure. The guard wondered for a moment if he should run away or stay: On one hand, the woman was scaring her a bit, like the whole situation. But then again, how often did one get the chance to see a busty woman in a tight black suit growing even bustier while she was loudly groping herself?  
  
Ayumi's volume then decreased a little as her moans and screams turned into panting, and her massage slowed down. She could feel her hands getting squashed between her breasts and the suit, though around her knuckles the fabric was ripping slightly. Once her body had grown completely numb from the sensation she put her hands out of her suit, and let her arms hang down. Exhausted, Ayumi felt the sweat running down her face, while her breasts were still swelling. She couldn't remember to have ever gotten so big. The pumpkins that grew on the farms in her village were the only thing she knew being still larger, and only in good years. She could barely feel any of her bosom sagging on her body though, pointing out from her like solid rocks. Her black ninja suit showed every of her curves, still lying tightly on her body despite its numerous rips. Though they had appeared one after another the rifts on the sides of her bosom looked almost identical, each displaying a large amount of skin. But they stood in no comparison to the tremendous cleavage between them, going from her shoulders down to the very end of her bosom in a wide V-shape. The form-fitting fabric just barely missed to uncover her nipples, showing a slight excerpt of her areola. One could easily see the pressure that had build up between her breasts, her cleavage looking more like a bottomless abyss than a softly curved valley of breast flesh.    
  
Unable to keep her back straight anymore Ayumi bent forward. Her breasts felt so heavy and full, she was afraid they could fall off from her body like ripe apples from a tree. After reaching the massive scale of medicine balls the growth finally stopped, much to Ayumi's relief. The heat from the sensation slowly decreased, but therefore now the cold of the night began to take over, Ayumi freezing in her skimpy outfit. Another rip suddenly sounded through the air as her nipples drilled two small holes into her suit, her teats standing pink and coldly erected from her body. Blushing deeply Ayumi quickly covered herself, shaking a little as she put her arms around her humongous bosom. �C-could you lend me a hand, please?", she asked the guard, finding her attempts to stand up didn't do more than shaking her breasts.   
  
His lance was still pointing at her face, the warrior not being sure what he should do. This woman was an enemy who had killed one of his comrades, so basically, he had to execute her. But as he looked down at the buxom woman in front of him, unable to even stand up without help, he found that she posed no threat anymore. Putting his spear down he knelt next to her, placing his arm around her shoulders. A wicked smile formed behind his mask as he felt her breasts brushing against his body. 'Who knows?', he thought as he helped Ayumi back on her feet, closely eying her bosom. 'If I'm nice to her, maybe she will be �nice" to me later, hehe� And if not, so what? With tits like that, what could she do to keep me from-"  
  
His thoughts were abruptly cut off as a dagger was pierced through his throat.  
  
�Thanks a bunch!", Ayumi kindly said to him, her smile shining through her bandana. Removing the dagger she let the samurai fall to ground, fighting with her balance as she stood unsupported again. She was leaning almost 45� degree forward, her breasts bumping softly against each other whenever she moved. Her gaze then shifted towards the large castle, looking up its tremendous walls."Two down, a hundred to go", Ayumi sighed.  
  
The next day, the soldiers of the fortress found their general dead in his chamber, as well as a large number of guards lying lifelessly on the floors. No one ever found out who the culprit was, but there was one thing all the corpses shared: A wide, lecherous grin on the face.

Hmmm I'm not a good writer ![^^;](./I3reacl_files/animesweat.gif "Sweating a little...") , but sometimes I felt the expansion was at a bigger size than It actually was going on the story, but maybe that's just me ![^^;](./I3reacl_files/animesweat.gif "Sweating a little...")  
  
Other than that I feel it's a nice story and that you're pretty good at describing and showcasing the expansion in the stories c:

It's not just you, I noticed that little deficit in my stories as well. I'm working on it, but it's kind of hard to drag out the growth as much as possible and keep it from going too big too fast.  
  
And thanks, that's all I really care for ![:)](./I3reacl_files/smile.gif ":) (Smile)")^^

**One Sip**Since that night, I have believed in love at first song.  
  
You sang.  
  
Darling, you stirred your voice into the coffeehouse scents;  
It carried notes of inspiration and the flavor of your soul.  
  
You smiled.  
  
Your words trickled down my throat, and I savored their warmth.   
There was no bitterness, no dregs- just your heart poured out.  
  
You stood.  
  
I abandoned my cup to follow, �hello� scalding my tongue.](http://dragoeniex.deviantart.com/art/One-Sip-392857616)

The absolute number
one cause of
rejection of DD
suggestions for most
Artisan Craft CVs is
poor photography.
There is nothing
worse than seeing an
otherwise brilliant

dodgy photo. But

[:iconfaestock:](http://faestock.deviantart.com/) `[faestock](http://faestock.deviantart.com/) is one of our best known and popular deviants from the Stock and Resources community. Her gallery is filled to the brim with high quality stock photographs that have inspired deviants to get creative, and turn the already beautiful images into something magical. Jessica always takes time to reach out to deviants, providing contests and nurturing other artists. We're inspired by her selfless attitude and dedication to a genre that we couldn't create without. It's with great pleasure that we award the Deviousness Award for September 2013 to `[faestock](http://faestock.deviantart.com/), congratulations.  [Read More](http://today.deviantart.com/)

**In retrospect...**Sarah stared into her glass, blushing slightly. With the straw she drew circles on the surface of her juice, nervously shifting around on her chair. �Sooo, how do you feel?", she asked, not looking up from her glass.  
  
�Like a milk-cow", the woman next to her said. Around them, Sarah could hear the whispers of the other guests at the street caf�, constantly glaring over to their table. People passing on the street gazed towards them, their eyes nearly popping out of their heads. �You know, one of those genetically modified with the fat udders."  
  
Silently, Sarah took a sip from her orange juice � coincidentally, &#](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/In-retrospect-202581465)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Milk for a Maiden**"Man, what an old-fashioned uniform!", May sighed, glancing at her black house-maiden dress and white apron. In her long, curly hair, she wore a white maiden cap, while black high-heels and white socks covered her feet. "Well, at least the skirt is short." Cleaning the kitchen table, the brunette then saw a bottle of milk. "Hey, milk!", she said, grabbing the bottle. "If my new boss pays me so lousy, he can't complain if I drink some of his milk." Opening it, she emptied the bottle with a few gulps, ignoring the warning label "FROM GENETICALLY MODIFIED COWS � MAY CAUSE SWELLINGS ON SOME PERSONS".  
  
Just as she put the bottle down again, M](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Milk-for-a-Maiden-166103544)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**More Milk for More Maidens**"Aren't you done changing yet, April?", Victoria yelled from the kitchen. As her younger co-worker didn't reply she sighed. "Man, first day in our first job, and she can't even get into her uniform." Lowering her green eyes the tall girl looked at the clothes she wore: A short black dress alongside a white apron and matching boots. There was also a white maiden's cap tucked into her short crimson hair. "The chief maiden will be here any moment", she mumbled. "Said something about a "special test" on the phone. And that butler just gave us our uniforms and told us to go straight into the kitchen once we have changed � the rich surely are](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/More-Milk-for-More-Maidens-201845822) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Phone Call BE**"I can't believe this guy!"  
  
Amanda shut the door behind her, all small objects in her apartment shaking at the impact. "How he can turn down me, Amanda Manor, the probably hottest girl in entire high school!? I prepared so hard for this: I made my hair for two hours, tanned my skin in the solar studio and put on the smallest, tightest jeans skirt I could fit in!" Putting her hands into her tank-top she pulled two bundles of cotton out of her bra, reducing her cup-size to a modest B. "I even stuffed my bra more than usually", she sighed. "Now how shall I get a date until Friday?"  
  
After throwing the cotton away she grabbed her telephone, push](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Phone-Call-BE-187436187)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**A special treat**It was a beautiful spring day, warm sunlight streaming into the large, Victorian mansion. A little, six-year old girl was walking down the floor, looking rather grumpy. "I'm SOOOO bored!", she mourned, her long, baggy skirt waggling from side to side. With each step, the silver ornaments on her purple dress knocked against her body, a feeling she had gotten used to though. Not knowing what to do, the little princess yawned, stretching her arms out from her body. Her sleeves ended in white collars, flounced like her skirt, covering the lower half of her hands while leaving free view on her tiny fingers.  
  
Suddenly, the girl stopped. Around the](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/A-special-treat-180160430) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Dear Dairy**Dear Dairy,  
  
Whoops, typo! But it's kind of funny. Maybe I'll start all my diary entries like that? ;P  
  
Anyway, since quite a few things have happened lately in my life and I don't have anyone right now to talk to (at least yet) I guessed I could start a diary. Of yourse� again a typo, but this one happens actually quite a lot to me ^\_^; Anyway, of yourse it's not like I don't have any friends or a family. Right now, they're all just a few hundred miles away from me. I moved away from home a few days ago for college, and don't know many people here yet. And I'm not really the kind of person who likes to talk all day on the telephone. But](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Dear-Dairy-293882315)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**The genie from the milk bottle**There weren't many people who could open a door with their feet, but Amanda was one of them.  
  
Holding the key between her toes the young woman put it into the keyhole, bending a little backwards. She had to be careful nothing would fall out of the box she was carrying in her arms. �That was a good day", she said to herself, looking at all the plastic items, cans and other garbage she had collected. �I can make a lot out of this stuff!"  
  
With little effort she tilted the key around, opening the door. Her apartment looked like one would expect it from a 24-year old woman, maybe a bit larger than the average. The greatest difference be](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/The-genie-from-the-milk-bottle-196457100)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**A Witchy Accident**"Lalala-lala~♪"  
  
The lovely voice of a young lady echoed through the bathroom, filling it with a cheerful melody. Inside a full bathtub the source of the music, a young woman in her early twenties was taking a bath, chirping this little tune while she thoroughly rubbed some foam over her leg. The water pearled off her skin as she stretched her leg into the air, reflecting the light of the ceiling lamp and the full moon that was shining through the window. "Ah, there's nothing like a hot bath", the woman sighed. The tips of her purple hair sunk into the water as she put her head back a little and glided a little deeper into the bathtub.](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/A-Witchy-Accident-272934324) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**True love only grows I**Tap. Tap. Tap.  
  
Again and again a foot was stepping on the ground. In a simple rhythm Britney tapped on the carpet of her husband�s office. From time to time a small click accompanied the tapping as Britney was biting on the nail of her thumb her teeth, chopping off small pieces in an irregular pattern. The bitter taste of the red nail lacquer rubbed off, on her tongue, only a very slight amount, but enough for her to take her thumb out of her mouth after a while and put it on her chin instead. Eventually she started tapping on her chin as well, offbeat to her feet. It wasn�t because she was impatient that she was tapping, and she](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/True-love-only-grows-I-360919581)

**Lisa and Mona - Chapter 1**The sun had barely begun to rise when Mona's alarm clock rang. Hitting the snooze button, she considered closing her eyes and going back to sleep, just as she did every morning. However, looking down at her chest gave reminded Mona why she needed to be up so early before work. So, with a great deal of effort Mona sat up, and eventually she made her way out of the bedroom and into the bathroom.  
When she had started her new job, Mona possessed a natural C-cup bust: nothing to brag about, but then again nothing to be scoffed at either. She was a reasonably endowed woman with little cause for dissatisfaction, or so she had been told.

Before going to bed one night, Ashley wished to herself, �I wish I can grow my boobs, somehow.� Alicia heard Ashley wish to herself.  
  
Ashley had to share a bedroom with her sister Alicia. Ashley is 17years old. She has long blond hair and blue eyes. She is 5� 6� and weights 110lbs. Ashley�s boobs aren�t very big. She has always had an A-cup ever since grade 4. Alicia is only 15 years old. She has thick brown hair and blue eyes. She�s 5�10� and weighs 120lbs. Her boobs started to develop last year.

**Obsession Granted** The cell phone sailed through the air at terminal velocity, enjoying its first and subsequently last, aerial excursion before coming in collision with the computer monitor: which had grown tired of life, and thought with its final thought that this was for the best really. Emily cussed, the perpetrator of the electronic homicide. She placed her hands over her almost nonexistent bust despondently. Why did everything she tried to increase her bust fail? She glared at the vanity table, literally strewn with a vast assortment of breast increasing beauty products, with disdain and trepidation.

Shyanne laid across the lounge in a comfortable position, reading the second book in the Twilight series, new moon. She had developed an interest in the saga when her human friend Beth had convinced Shyanne to watch the movie with her. She was really thankful that she had Beth as a friend, she was understanding and could tell her anything. Shyanne trusted her.  
  
Shyanne had always been a bit self conscious about how she looked, but still knew that she wasn't below average in the looks department.

Date: November 14th, 2011  
Backer: University of XXXX  
Location: CLASSIFIED  
  
Subject April XXX applied through the university e-mail system today. I'm not sure who was the wise-ass who felt it necessary to assign the meet-up on Valentine's Day, but he's probably enjoying the joke more than anyone else. At least it's fitting; the subject felt it pleasing to show up then. She mentioned wanting to be particularly impressive today; a date, perhaps?

Emily slowly paced back and forth, waiting for her neighbor to show up, the towering brunette moving with an easy grace that seemed to belie her bulging muscles and distended hourglass figure, as she waited in the front hall.  She could feel the house's unease, the many ghosts whispering and hiding just out of sight, anxious at their living 'sister' leaving for a few days.  
She had tried to get them to relax.  Her currently larger even then usual body was a not unwelcome side effect of that effort, the previous nights phantom orgy leaving all involved a bit overfilled.

She always had to have the best of everything, the biggest doll house, the newest video games before they were released, the rare impossible to find collectables and she loved to flaunt everything had to the world.  So even before her breasts stopped growing she began to research ways to make them bigger.  They had always been the biggest and best of anyone she knew growing up and she knew once they stopped getting bigger it was only a matter of time before someo](http://ap-proliferations.deviantart.com/art/Sasha-s-Story-Part-1-288819285)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**The Manipulation Remote**Katie rifled through the new supplies she had received from ExpanderCo looking from something to test out. She had just found the perfect test sample in Erin, who used to be a Pre-School student 2 hours ago. Originally Katie was going to change Erin back but then discovered how smart the twerp was and decided it was too dangerous to let her go just yet.  
  
"Miss, what are you doing? I am bored!" Erin whined. She pouted and crossed her arms over her sizeable chest. Katie had been listening to her complain for about half an hour about being bored. She had not been complaining before because she had been exploring her new body with the enthusiasm](http://labdog10.deviantart.com/art/The-Manipulation-Remote-144977542) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Troublesome Expansion**April took a deep breath, double checking the directions she had been given. "This is it" She whispered to herself walking up towards the door of the small cottage, a thin pillar of smoke rising up into the afternoon skies. She knocked her frail hand against the heavy wooden door, stepping back as she waited for a response. Her eyes read over the sign over the door, Nika's Magical Accessories.  
  
The door creaked open, a pair of large brown eyes peered out at her, "Yes?" A soft voice called out.  
  
"Uhm." April shifted slightly, she had never sought out such strange services before, "I-I am interested in um, buying something?" She offered weakly.](http://ginbug.deviantart.com/art/Troublesome-Expansion-189729210)

 "Coming♥!... Stupid door, will you open... Ah, finally!... Cynthia, hello! Long time no see."  
"Hi, Claire."  
"Come in!� Nice top, by the way."  
"Really? It's just an ordinary blazer though..."  
"But it's blue! And it suits your skirt."  
"That's also very ordinary... just like my shoes... Clarisse, I look like a secretary! How can you say it's nice?"   
"Didn't you know? Conservative is 'in' right now."  
"Then why do you wear an orange tank-top and a mini-skirt?"  
"As if I'd go with the mainstream! And my skirt's not so short."  
"It's only half as long as mine!"  
"No big deal, yours goes over your knees. Anyway, I think you look nice as a blue secretary."  
"Well, thanks."  
"Did you do something with your hair, too?"  
"I wear it open again. Buns just don't fit to a blonde like me."  
"Luckily, I always cut my hair short. Tea?"  
"Coffee. And your hair isn't blond, so it doesn't really matter."  
"It once was blond!"  
"Yeah, and now it's something between red, brown, grey, and something the world still has to define."  
"Maybe one day, they'll call it 'Claire-coloured'. Wanna go outside?"  
"Did you clean up your balcony already?"  
"Jeez, Cindy, that was a month ago!"  
"A month? Wow, I really haven't been here for long."  
"See?� All right, here we go! You drink your coffee pure, don't cha?"   
"Yes, and thanks� Oh, what a comfortable chair!"  
"Isn't it? And it was a bargain, too! I just stumbled across it in the market."   
"Wow, good catch� Speaking of which, are you still together with Brad? Kind of hard to believe you've got a boyfriend who's ten years older than you�"  
"Men are best at thirty-five: Experienced, but not old."  
"As I said, good catch. So how's it going?"  
"Not so well. He's meeting another girl from work."  
"What? He's cheating you!?"  
"It's not really like that. It seems they are talking about some kind of new product the company wants to establish - well, at least he says that, and that I exaggerate. But you see, I'm still quite worried..."  
"I totally understand you, even though I don't have a boyfriend."  
"Really? Still not? But you're blond, hot, really nice..."  
"Excuse me, but could we change topics please?"  
"Oh, no problem. You wanna hear about that project he claims to be working on?"   
"Sure! What is it? Another razor?"  
"Nope. This time, it's a mobile phone."  
"A mobile phone?"   
"Yep, he even gave me the prototype to prove he doesn't lie. Wanna see?"   
"Well, all right... Hm, looks kinda ordinary."  
"It's still a prototype, so the design's not final."  
"So what's the problem he has to discuss with his new 'girlfriend'?"  
"Don't say that."  
"Sorry."  
"They're trying out some new components, but Brad said they weren't tested enough."  
"Why do you have to test out telephone components? As long as it's working, everything's fine."  
"He said something about the radiation."  
"Oh. Well, that's something serious, I guess..."  
"Hey, shall we switch it on to see what happens?"  
"You want to kill us?"  
"All right, was just an idea. Actually, I already tried to turn it on earlier, but couldn't find the switch."  
"Well usually, you activate modern mobile phones by pressing the 'call'-button for a short period of time."  
"Really? Like this?... Oops."  
"Claire! Turn it off!"  
"I'm trying, but the button's stuck!"  
"CLAIRE!"  
"It's a prototype, damn it! These things break easily!� Ah, whatever. I don't think this thing will turn us into zombies."  
"Your words in god's ear, Claire. Your words in god's... EEK!!"  
"Don't you mean 'ear'?"  
"No, Claire, somethings wrong with my chest! It feels... strange."  
"I think you're only making this... AH! Wait, now I got it, too!"  
"God damn it Claire, throw the phone away!"  
"AHHHH!"   
"NOT into your apartment! I meant out of range!"  
"Oops�"  
"Let's search it, quick!"  
"All right, all right! Oh, I don't want to turn into a zombie! Eating brains is sooo disgusting!... Okay, here's the phone. And now?"  
"Throw it out!"  
"What?"  
"Do it!"  
"But Brad will kill me!"  
"If you don't, he may find you dead already!!"  
"O-okay!� Phew, that was scary."  
"Oh my god, Claire, Claire, Claire!"  
"What?"  
"My chest! Look at my chest!"  
"What's with your... OH MY GOD, CYNTHIA, CYNTHIA, CYNTHIA! Your boobs are growing!"  
"Sh, not so loud! Close the door to the balcony!"  
"Okay... Oh god, I can feel my chest blowing up, too!"  
"What kind of radiation is that supposed to be?� Ouch, my back hurts..."  
"You're breasts haven't gotten so much bigger though."  
"And my bra's neither! It's pressing into my skin."  
"You are wearing a bra?"  
"You don't?"  
"Well, with A-cups, it's not really necessary, so... hey, are you feeling all right? Your face looks kind of blue."  
"It's getting a bit hard to breath..."  
"Shall I help you out of your bra?"  
"No, thanks. I think it will fall off in a minute."  
"If you say so� Jeez, my top feels pretty tight, too."  
"At least you're getting a nice cleavage."  
"Oh, don't worry: Once your button's pop off, you'll have an even better looking one."  
"Gosh, I hope they won't get that big... I pray they won't!"  
"Well, mine have already orange size. What about you?"  
"Grapefruits, I guess... big grapefruits. Oh, they feel so soft!"  
"Really? ... Hey, you're right! And you know what? Mine feel pretty soft, too!"  
"CLAIRE, GET YOUR HANDS OFF MY CHEST!"  
"Jeez, Cindy, calm down!... Ouch..."  
"Claire, my clothes are getting tighter and tighter!� Better take my blazer off, it was expensive�"  
"I tell you, your buttons will start popping soon!� Ow�"  
"You all right?"  
"Yeah, I'm fine. Ouch� in the future, I'll buy looser tops."  
"Oh, this is ridiculous! Let's call a doctor."  
"All right, I'll take my mobile phone and..."  
"NO! I mean, let's take the ordinary phone, please."  
"All right, it's over the- whoa!"  
"What's wrong?"  
"My shirt is ripping! Look!"  
"Wow! A clean cut at the top!"  
"Yeah, and it goes down half my breasts! NOW I have a nice cleavage!"  
"Oh god, what is this all?... What's the doctor's number again?"  
"It's saved inside. Gosh, I have to sit down� Oh, they are so soft� so sensitive� hmmmm� I can feel them growing in my hands�"  
"Calm down, Claire!� Hello? Is this the doctor?� My name is Cynthia Orade. I'm at my friend's apartment right now, and we� Her name? Clarissa Haever� Yes. We turned on a prototype mobile phone, then felt a sting in our chests. After we got rid off the phone, they suddenly started to grow!� Yes, our breasts! You've got to come and� What?� No, this is not a joke! I'm dead serious!� I'm no teenager, and this isn't a prank call!� What?� Listen, I'm a 27-year old businesswoman, born in Chicago, zodiac sign Libra, blood group A negative. Five minutes ago, I had a modest B-cup, and was an average looking woman. Now, my tits are larger than softballs, my back is hurting, and my bra has almost fallen o- eeek!� Okay, scratch the almost, but� Hello? Anybody there?� Idiot! He hung up! Though I can kind of understand him�"  
"�"  
"Claire?"  
"�Ohh♥"  
"Claire! Your breasts!They are�"  
"So sensitive� so soft � so� good..."  
"Claire, snap out of it!� My god, Claire! Your shirt has ripped in two!"  
"Two� too� small."  
"What?"  
"Too� small� they're too� small�"  
"Claire, they are bigger than footballs!� Oh god, and I'm already an E-cup! And my front is full off holes! Damn buttons, why must there be gaps between them?"  
"Ohhh�"  
"Claire, are you all right?� Claire, you've got to stop this! I think this weird state makes you grow faster!"  
"Ohhh� ohhh� ohhh... OOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHH- ouch!"  
"AHHHH!� C-Claire, are you all right?"  
"Ow, my head� I told you they would pop off, but do you listen to- ouch!"   
"S-sorry, Claire!"  
"Jeez, just stop pointing your 'canons' at me� oh, I've got a headache� EEK! My breasts!"  
"So, you have noticed 'already'?"  
"My god, they are twice the size of yours! And� AH! MY TOP!"  
"You really have been off� Hold your shirt up! I don't want to look at your naked boobs!"  
"You prude?"  
"I just want to avoid thinking about breasts as much as possible."  
"O-okay�"  
"Good. Now- AH!"  
"Oh dear, that was my favorite vase you just shot�"  
"At least that was the last one to pop off� wow, look at my cleavage. It's� it's� enormous!� And my breasts! They are larger than my head!"  
"You call that enormous? Look at me! My breasts are GARGANTUAN!! Larger than pumpkins!!! BIG pumpkins!!!! GIANT ONES!!!!! Even when I hold my shirt up, I can barely cover them! And my back�"  
"At least you are sitting!"  
"You can sit down, too."  
"After seeing how you 'enjoyed' yourself? I refuse. Though they are pretty heavy�"  
"You should see yourself standing. Forty-five degree, I say!"  
"Now that you mention it, my back's indeed quite buckled� Well, I think it won't hurt if I sit down for a moment."  
"Definitely less as if you keep standing. By the way, where's your bra?"  
"Somewhere on the ground� Oof, that's way better."  
"See, what did I say?� Hey, I think my breasts stopped growing!� At the size of water melons..."  
"That's good, Claire. That's good�"  
"At a closer look, I could also say they are large medicine ball size� Well, at least we found out today we're experts in round objects, especially fruits. Right, Cindy?"  
"Yeah, that's good... hmmm� good�"  
"Cynthia?� Oh god Cynthia, stop rubbing your breasts!"  
"Good, hmmm�so good�"  
"Cynthia, cut it out!"  
"Good� soft� ohh�"  
"CYNTHIA!� Oh no, you're growing faster now! You'll destroy your shirt!"  
"Good� oohhh� good�"   
"Damn it, she's almost as big as me already. And- Whoa! More button popping! Her breasts are taking over her shirt!"  
"SO GOOD!!!!"  
"�And her mind. I've gotta do something!"  
"OHH! OOOHHHH! Keep it up! Faster� FASTER�!"  
"Okay, if I'm cautious, I might be able to stand up without loosing my balance - or top."  
"Yes! Grow! I want basketballs! Medicine Balls!! Beach Balls!!! MOONS!!!!"  
"Jeez, you're over medicine already� All right, now I carefully lift up my breasts� yes� then I raise my butt� good. Now trying to stand upright� WHOA! Nonono, don't fall! Keep balance!"  
"Oh yeah! Don't stop, keep growing!"  
"NO!"  
"YES!"  
"AAAHHHH- !"  
"OOOHHHH- !"  
"Ouch!� Ow� at least I landed softly� on my breasts�"  
"Oh yes!"  
"Huh?!"  
"This is good stuff� My fingers� I can feel them as they fondle my breasts� each hair on them�This is great! And � Ohh� My boobs are touching my legs! God, they're so big, so� so� sooohhh� OOOOHHH! Where's the phone? I want more� more� MOOOOOOOORE!"  
"CYNTHIA!"  
"OHHH� What? Wait� what the hell am I doing?� No, stop it hands! STOP!! I don't want this!"  
"Phew, you're back � finally! Any more and my chair would have cracked under your weight."  
"Huff� huff� oof! Oh my god, Claire, what have I done?� And why are you lying on the floor?"  
"Well, I wanted to help you with your little 'massage', but had some problems keeping balance."  
"Massage� Oh god, my breasts! I'm� I'm�"  
"�probably worth an entry in the Guinness book. Jeez, I don't know ANY fruit that big."  
"M-Maybe jack-fruits, th-these are the b-biggest f-fruits in the w-wor.. oh god, they are still so sensitive!"  
"And growing."  
"WHAT?� Damn, you're right! Slower again, but still�"  
"I have to give credits to your blouse though. It's impressive it's still holding."  
"Only merely, at two buttons�"  
"OUCH!"  
"One, sorry� Hm? Hey, what's that cracking sound?"  
"Um, I think it's�"  
"AAAAAAAHHHH!"  
"�the chair. Jeez, that one was expensive� Oh no, Cynthia! You've fallen on your back!"  
"I� know�"  
"Are you okay?"  
"Breathing� hard�"  
"Roll to the side! To the side!"  
"Ungh� Nnnhh� Oof. I did it!"  
"Thank goodness! A dead body was the last thing I could need in here."  
"Yeah� Hey, Claire, Claire, I think my breasts stopped growing!"  
"Really?� Phew, that was about time! You know, when I was younger, I always envied the other girls for having bigger breasts than me."  
"And that's over now?"  
"FOR - EVER! I'll never complain about my A-cups again! I've got a few thousand dollar saved up from my grandparents' heritage. Let's pay a reduction from that!"  
"Usually, I would refuse such an offer as it's your money. But since this is all your fault�"  
"Hey!� Well, okay, you're right."  
"You think we'll be able to stand up today?"  
"With help, I may. I don't think however anyone could lift YOU up, even with a building crane!"   
"Well that's very charming."  
"Come on, you're twice the size of me at LEAST! And I'm already freaking huge!"  
"Claire, please� Huh? Hey, someone's opening the door."  
"Uh-oh, I think that's Brad! What now?"  
"Well, he'll either be very pissed - or very pleased."

Very unique. The growth was very good despite the actual third-person decription. The girls seem to be handling it realistically, although near the end it got a little tricky to discern who was talking.

I thought about adding the name of the talking character in front of each phrase, but that would make more like a script than a story. If I write something like that again though, I'll try to give the characters distinctive ways of talking(e.g. one very vulgar and the other one "normal", was originally intended in this story).  
  
Thanks![:)](./I3reacl_files/smile.gif ":) (Smile)")

**Firefly Magic**Fireflies,  
lanterns at the rear,  
swarmed in the warm Illinois night.  
And I, young and bereft of fire,   
stood in wonder  
of their lit-up magic.  
  
A waking dream  
on the edge of reality.  
I remember their tail lights, still.  
  
Even then, I had no wish  
to capture fireflies;  
I could not hold them in tight fists.  
They were too free for that  
and I too caged.  
  
I want magic in my life.  
A little light,   
a tiny lantern.  
  
I'm years away  
from that Illinois summer.  
Lost in my own frontyard,  
I sense no wonder,  
only the empty buzz of mosquitoes.  
  
Life stings.  
Life itches.  
Life calls for a liberal dose of calamine lotion.

The absolute number
one cause of
rejection of DD
suggestions for most
Artisan Craft CVs is
poor photography.
There is nothing
worse than seeing an
otherwise brilliant
piece ruined by a
dodgy photo. But
even beyond DD
acceptance, if you
want to people on dA
to be able to
appreciate your
skill you...

Her gallery is filled to the brim with high quality stock photographs that have inspired deviants to get creative, and turn the already beautiful images into something magical. Jessica always takes time to reach out to deviants, providing contests and nurturing other artists. We're inspired by her selfless attitude and dedication to a genre that we couldn't create without.

**A Witchy Accident**"Lalala-lala~♪"  
  
The lovely voice of a young lady echoed through the bathroom, filling it with a cheerful melody. Inside a full bathtub the source of the music, a young woman in her early twenties was taking a bath, chirping this little tune while she thoroughly rubbed some foam over her leg. The water pearled off her skin as she stretched her leg into the air, reflecting the light of the ceiling lamp and the full moon that was shining through the window. "Ah, there's nothing like a hot bath", the woman sighed. The tips of her purple hair sunk into the water as she put her head back a little and glided a little deeper into the bathtub.](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/A-Witchy-Accident-272934324) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Story of the hot kunoichi**The armored guard stepped back until he felt the wall of the mansion behind him. Pressing his body against the wooden planks he watched half in fear, half in awe as the buxom woman slowly approached him. Her bosom and the rest of her body were wrapped inside a tight black suit that only revealed a small d�collet� at the top of the neck, displaying a subtle, yet very appealing cleavage. The face of the woman to who carried this pair of fabric-stretchers was mainly covered by a black bandana, only her brown eyes looking out above it. Her long, gorgeous blond hair was tied into a pony tail so long it almost touched the ground. The only](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Story-of-the-hot-kunoichi-298845406)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**A Hardware Upgrade**Since she was a child Jean had always loved flying. Though it was over twenty years ago she could still remember the first time when she had entered a plane. She was so nervous she had hold tightly to the arm of her mother the entire time on the airport, and once they sat inside immediately grabbed the leans of her seat. When the plane took off she almost screamed, and couldn't calm down until the signs for the seatbelts had gone off. But as she dared a look outside the window after a while and stared at the sea of white fluffy clouds and the beautiful landscape beneath the plane all her fear was immediately replaced with utter awe.

**In retrospect...**Sarah stared into her glass, blushing slightly. With the straw she drew circles on the surface of her juice, nervously shifting around on her chair. �Sooo, how do you feel?", she asked, not looking up from her glass.  
  
�Like a milk-cow", the woman next to her said. Around them, Sarah could hear the whispers of the other guests at the street caf�, constantly glaring over to their table. People passing on the street gazed towards them, their eyes nearly popping out of their heads. �You know, one of those genetically modified with the fat udders."  
  
Silently, Sarah took a sip from her orange juice � coincidentally, &#](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/In-retrospect-202581465)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Snow Boobs**It was a late afternoon in December when a young woman was taking a walk through the park. Flakes danced around her nose as she walked over the snow-clad path, smiling at the white scenery around her. The branches of the trees were buckling under the weight of the snow, while the usually lush and green lawn was hidden beneath an at least two inch deep layer of snow. The path the woman was walking on wasn't quite as snowed, but her large winter boots still left deep imprints behind her. While it wasn't pitch-black the lanterns on each side of the path were already shining, their light reflecting in the surrounding snow, and with each minute th](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Snow-Boobs-275240349)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Curse of the Dark Maiden**Once upon a time in a world that is not ours, there was a dark, deserted wasteland far away from any kind of civilisation. In the most outside corner of that wasteland stood a huge, rocky mountain, surrounded by an eternal thunderstorm. No sunshine ever reached the ground there � the only plants that grew here were dead trees and grey grass. Truly, it was the most unpleasant place in the entire world, a place no human would have ever wanted to live at. Nevertheless, a big Gothic castle had been built on top of that mountain, seemingly inhabited aside from the swarms of night creatures that resided here.  
  
But behind its crumbling walls a](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Curse-of-the-Dark-Maiden-200175137) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Mammary Mentality**�Doctor, I�m obsessed with boobs!�  
  
Through her rectangular glasses Quinn looked up from her notepad to the man lying on the red couch in front of her. Sitting on her office chair her legs were crossed, partly out of habit, partly so her patient couldn�t peek under her knee-long grey skirt that lay tightly around her thighs and hips. Dark nylon thighs covered her smooth legs, and she wore black high-heels on her small feet. �It is true that during our little sessions you have revealed several aspects of your personality hold a particular interest in the exclusive charm of a woman�s body, especially when the](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Mammary-Mentality-337778591)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Bikini Body**"Okay, I've added the cat-ears. Now, do you think I'd look better with a bunny nose or a bird beak?" The 22-year old college girl shifted a little on her couch so she could hold her pencil better, while making a few alterations on the semi-anthropomorphic sketch of herself. Between her right shoulder and ear she was holding a telephone from which she impatiently awaited a reply. Meanwhile, the other occupant of the couch looked up at her with a similarly impatient look in her eyes. "I swear I've already fed you twice today, Mitty", she told her begging pet.  All the black cat responded was "meow" before getting up and jumping off th](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Bikini-Body-251846519)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Short and Sweet**Lilly wasn't really a snoopy girl. But when she coincidentally witnessed as her mother received a package at the garden gate from the postman, and then went back into the house, acting all secret as if she wanted nobody to see her bringing some package into the house, and when Lilly afterwards spotted her putting a load of red bonbons from the package into a jar that she hid on top of the highest shelf in the kitchen, it was enough to make the short girl move a chair under said shelf, put a pile of books on top of it and step onto the books to reach for the jar.  
  
"Come on", Lilly murmured. She raised herself on the very tips of her toes, stre](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Short-and-Sweet-306536048)

**Reverse Breast Reduction**Tiffany was tired of her large E cup breast. She hated the rude comments from men every time she walked down the street, and she couldn't do basic everyday things like tie her shoes, jog, and driving was tough. Her breast grew extremely fast during high school and didn't stop until shortly after starting college.   
Tiffany wanted a reduction, but feared scarring from surgery. So she saw a doctor who promised he could shrink the size of her breast by having the fat and tissue sucked out. After some checking Tiffany arranged for an appointment. When she got to the office, the doctor had her undress and he placed two large dome like bowls over e](http://citizenbjm.deviantart.com/art/Reverse-Breast-Reduction-306086690)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)

Pandora walked down the street casually on a bright sunny day. The sky was blue and there was no cloud in sight. Being on a different planet was a bit different than what she was used to, considering planet Earth was so unique in many ways.  
  
Of course, being an alien princess wasn't easy, either. Pandora had already learned thousands of languages, and every now and then a new alien race would evolve and she would have to learn yet another language. But it didn't really bother her. She was adored by the trillions on her home planet, and everyone loved her.

April was cleaning around the house since she was going to have company over today. She had met a woman named Sabrina not very long ago, and had invited her over for lunch. April figured it'd be a good way to get to know more about Sabrina.  
  
Two of April's friends, Clara and Katrina, had introduced her to Sabrina the other day. The cool thing about Clara and Katrina was that they were witches, and could pretty much do anything they wanted; they were also twins.  
  
April had to admit though, that she did have this one thought about kissing Clara; she wondered what it'd be like. Clara was extremely cute and was ve](http://blueberryjanelle.deviantart.com/art/April-s-Big-Day-191673895)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)

Being an alien princess was a lot of work, especially with learning how to speak the thousands of languages throughout the universe. But one thing Pandora really loved about her people, was that all the females of her species could "change" their bodies any way they wanted. It's main purpose was to attract mates, but every now and then she'd have a little fun with her special ability.  
  
Pandora would often visit planet Earth and hang out with some earthlings she called friends. With her skin being leafy green, it was hard to blend in with everyone, though.

Kristy was relieved and thankful that someone had finally accepted her job application. Being fresh out of school she had barely any experience in anything but skipping school. It was 6 o clock at night as she got ready to go to her new job, she was happy that the uniform was optional. Looking at herself in the mirror she posed and blew a kiss to her reflection. She considered herself pretty average, Brown hair with the front tips dyed light blonde, About 5 foot 4 she was normal height with C cup sized breasts, she was slim with a toned belly.

**Annie's Endowments: Part I** Annie stood naked in front of the bedroom mirror and regarded her reflection with obvious distaste.  She put her hands on her small belly and sighed, feeling that she had been dealt a very poor hand by fate.  She had a round and winsome face, with dark hair that fell in loose curls about her shoulders.  She knew she was a little chubby, but with narrow hips, a flat butt and a modest bosom, she didn't exactly think of herself as curvy.  Rather, Annie thought as she frowned to herself, she just looked dumpy and unremarkable in all respects.  All her life, she had felt jealous of her sister, Gina, who had so effortlessly kept fit and athletic.](http://kodos11.deviantart.com/art/Annie-s-Endowments-Part-I-269942944) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)

Ryan smiled down at his fiancee.  He was only 3 inches taller than her, but she was leaning down into his shoulder with her "hug."  "Yeah, I know," he said.  "It does seem like we've been dating forever."  
  
She looked up at him.  "Three years," she said.  "But, next month, it's going to be permanent."

This is a pretty bad breast expansion story written by me at the age of 14, then edited about a year later. Even after the edit, it's still pretty bad. But I thought I'd upload it for the sake of getting some of my own content on here.

STORY:  
  
        Ciara was a normal 16 teenage girl. About 5'6 in height, long brown hair that went down to about mid-back, blue eyes. A nice ass, with a pair of  nice C cup boobs.

Shyanne laid across the lounge in a comfortable position, reading the second book in the Twilight series, new moon.

She was really thankful that she had Beth as a friend, she was understanding and could tell her anything. Shyanne trusted her.

*A long time ago, in a world that is not ours, there was a deserted wasteland far away from any kind of civilization. For centuries this country had laid abandoned, avoided by any kind of life form except for some creatures that dwelled in the dark. One day a young princess of darkness and her nefarious servant came to this unholy land in search of an exile. From the wrecking ruins of an old castle located on a mountain at the edge of this forsaken country that Dark Maiden had begun to build up an evil empire. One by one she conquered the neighbouring kingdoms without the use of any armies or weapons(at least not in the traditional sense). Her strategy was rather unconventional, gained from a curse of unknown origins, but surprisingly effective as one king after another fell to her and was imprisoned inside his own dungeon. In a few months ten kingdoms had already surrendered to the evil princess that had turned into an evil empress. In fear of this rising dark force the world's most powerful order of paladins decided to send out one of their elite warriors to defeat this young source of evil before it could mature into a serious threat to the world.  
  
Never had they ever considered their paladin could fail�  
  
And even if, they would have never been able to presume in what way�*

The Dark Maiden lay in her throne, legs crossed over one armrest while her head leaned over the other one. Through the holes in the ceiling she watched flashes moving through the sky. After a while her gaze shifted towards the large gate which seemed like it could fall out of its rusty ankles any second. From the entrance a red carpet led up to her throne, though it was so dirty and ripped off its colour could be better described as a mixture of gray and brown. "I hope the first taxes arrives soon", the evil empress mumbled, taking a look around the mainly fallen apart hall. "I conquered ten countries, but I can barely pay the guards at the gate!" Thinking about her empire the Dark Maiden let out a sigh. As she breathed in she could hear her black leather corset stretch around her humongous chest, its bodice bursting with cleavage. With a loud rip one of the strings suddenly broke apart, allowing her breasts to spread out even further. The maiden waggled on her throne, her wobbling breasts pushing on her tight corset and disturbing her balance. Once they had calmed down she pushed the overflowing masses of bosom back into her corset. Small tingles were sent from her sensitive globes through the rest of her body as she squeezed her meat pumpkins. Her grey cheeks blushed slightly, her long white hair falling to the floor as the young queen put her head back. Closing her violet eyes she let out a soft moan, thanking every higher entity from of any religion she was alone in the castle, safe for the guards that (hopefully) couldn't hear her.   
  
It took a few seconds for the young woman to relax. Without looking she tied the broken string of her corset back together, holding her breath to keep her milk jugs still for a second. Once she had repaired her bodice the Dark Maiden threw a scornful look down her body.  The entire top of her curves were fully uncovered, the rim of her corset lying just a few millimeters above her areola. Being wrapped tightly around her chest it creaked every time the Dark Maiden moved, each single breath moving the leather slightly over her curves. The deep rift of the bodice went from the top of her corset to its hem just above her belly button, the strings pressing deeply into the ashen skin of her breasts. "This damn curse", the maiden mumbled, sitting up on her throne. Even as she sat straight her breasts were on height with her chin while barely touching her chest wall, both being completely round and firm. She put her elbow on an armrest, crossing her legs as she leaned her head against her fist. Actually, she had to be a little grateful to the magic that had blown her breasts up: With the help of this perverted curse she was able to subdue the rulers of ten kingdoms and take over their realms for herself. However, she was reminded every second of her life this "power" came with a price: From the moment she woke up and had to carry her charms out of her bed, to the painful ordeal of getting dressed up to such simple tasks as eating and repeatedly pulling the food out of her cleavage, or simply walking around(not to mention riding). Also, it wasn't like her gigantic globes always guaranteed a success. Often it was still a tough piece of work to "distract" her victims so she could disable them, and more than once she had almost ended up in a prison cell herself. She also remembered reluctantly the two times she had run into a female ruler. Only through persistent cleavage showing and some very embarrassing acts of her she had eventually managed to capture them: One ended up getting so green from envy she didn't take notice of anything but the maiden's swaying meat buns, while the other one� well, one could say she discovered a whole new side of her personality. It was even a surprise for the Dark Maiden when the baroness had suddenly wrapped her arms around her neck, and looked at her with a lustful sparkle in the eyes. Just in time the maiden could smack her frying pan over her head, before whatever this "aristocrat" would have done if she let her. It was hard and embarrassing, but in the end she had even taken these hurdles.   
  
Unfortunately, there were also hurdles she had not taken. One of them was the kingdom of amazons � not just because they were all women though. For this race of female warriors all that mattered were strength and the mass of their muscles. Large breasts (or rather breasts in general) were nothing but a hindrance in their eyes. When puberty hit young amazons too well they even cut off one of their breasts so it wouldn't trouble them when holding a bow. The Dark Maiden shuddered as she thought about her audience with the amazon queen, which had ended with her running away from a rain of arrows shot by an army of half-breasted women in skimpy armors - her back still hurt when she remembered it. Aside from those barbarians another problem she had to deal with were races other than humans. They were all humanoid and in a way attracted to big breasts, but the "cultural differences" still made it hard to win them over. Surprisingly one of her biggest headaches turned out to be the minotaurs. She had never really thought about it, but a race of bull men also meant a race of cow women - and cow woman meant big udders to compete with! Of course the Dark Maiden was still rather buxom even for their measurements, but the gap wasn't nearly as striking as to other human women. Another tough problem were the dwarves: She could have the biggest breasts in the world (which she probably did), for those midgets no woman was attractive without a proper beard. Giants, on the other hand, didn't see her as busty since one breast of a female giant usually weighted more than the maiden's entire body. Of course, proportional she was still holding the bigger bust, but just say "proportional" to a giant and he looks at you like a duck with a mental sickness. And the elves! No wonder so many half-elves walked around considering how the elven women dressed and looked like.  
  
Again the Dark Maiden sighed. She had already thought about conquering those countries with her armies � after all, she was the leader of an empire now. But there were two problems: First was that while she was proud to have conquered so many kingdoms, the part of the world she ruled over was the poorest and most insignificant, and as such had the weakest military force. This didn't correspond well with the other problem she had, namely her enemies themselves: Monstrous women possessing more strength and better archery skills than most men, bull-like creatures that could tear people apart with their bare hands, the greatest blacksmiths in the world capable of forging weapons that could cut through steel like butter, humanoids so gigantic they could destroy an entire village just by stepping on it, and a race of mystical eremites of which each possessed more magical power than entire humanity. And what did she have? The only really experienced fighters in her army were a handful of crusaders that had fought lesser demons like imps before. The rest were mainly militias from villages and small towns, some royal guards in bad shape after standing in front of castles for years without ever fighting an intruder, and a hundred years old veteran called "Binky" by his men. It would take one hell of a pep speech to get her men even motivated to fight, and then a miracle for them to survive the first battle.  
  
She tried not to do, but eventually the Dark Maiden looked above her. On the top of her throne a small bowl was standing, containing a large amount of chestnuts � the same chestnuts that had "blessed" her with this curse. A few capable magicians had investigated them and found out the curse was stackable: If she ate more, she would get even more stacked. Lately, the Dark Maiden had often played with the thought of eating more of them. Her problem with the minotaurs, giants and even the elves was mainly a matter of size, and she was sure there was also a breaking point for the dwarves, beard or not. And the amazons were also just humans. Maybe, if she just stocked up a little more...  
  
"Bullshit!", she shouted, slamming her fist into her armrest. Her breasts bounced inside her corset, luring another sigh out of the Dark Maiden. "The only thing I'll achieve is that in a hundred years people will still laugh about the evil empress that was killed by the weight of her own boobs!" She quickly went through all other options she had again, until she realized there weren't really any. Again she sighed, sinking a little lower in her throne. It seemed that for the time being, her conquering would have to make a pause if not some weird twist of destiny would suddenly come to her aid...  
   
"Watch out!"   
  
Thrown out of her thoughts the Dark Maiden turned towards the window, just to see a small black spot flying into her castle. Fast as lightning the dark ball crossed the distance to her and dived into her cleavage, making her gasp. Her corset stretched loudly from the jiggles of her breasts, the empress eventually grabbing them with her hands to stop them. Between her large grey orbs a small head suddenly poked out. It was covered in black feathers with a pair of gleaming red eyes that looked up to the empress' face. "Sorry for that, milady", the little bird apologised, its peak moving relatively synchronous to its words. "Didn't see where I was flying."  
  
"Cut the milady!", the Dark Maiden shouted, looking angrily at the little feather ball inside her cleavage. "And don't act as if you didn't fly in there on purpose!"  
  
"Guess I'm busted", the bird said, putting a strong emphasis on the word 'busted'. "But I can't help it! You've got the most comfortable cleavage in the entire empire!" The little bird pulled out its wings from her cleavage, and began to rub the firm flesh around it. Soft feathers moved over the empress' sensitive bosom, making her giggle and wriggle uncomfortably on her throne.  
  
"G-get outta there, you little punk!", she commanded between laughs. She picked the small head that could hardly be distinguished from the rest of the bird's body with two fingers and pulled it out of her cleavage. The bird quickly freed itself from her grip, flying to the perch next to the throne.  
  
"Jeez, after three months one could think you would finally get used to this", it said, hopping around on its perch. "Or rather to these."  
  
The Dark Maiden glared evilly at her pet. "Well, I wouldn't have to get used to anything if you little twat hadn't given me those cursed nuts!"  
  
The bird put his head under its wing, not out of shame though but to clean its feathers. "Maybe, but then you wouldn't rule an evil empire now", it shot back.  
  
"I would have come up with something else. Eventually." The mistress threw another glare at her pet. "What are you doing here anyway?", she asked. "I ordered you to look out for enemies! You are only supposed to come back when you spot an intruder!"  
  
The bird pulled its head out from its wing again. "Yes. Guess why I'm here."  
  
Immediately the slack empress sat up. "Wait, you mean somebody is on the way to attack us?" As the little bird nodded the Dark Maiden screamed in glee. "YES! Finally! My first ordeal as an empress! I already wondered how many more kingdoms I had to conquer until somebody noticed!" She jumped up from her throne, her bosom almost destroying her corset with its bounces. She leaned over towards her bird, looking eagerly at it while in return it stared at her wobbling cleavage. "Okay, how many enemy soldiers are we talking about?", she asked. "A dozen? Hundreds?? Thousands?!?  
  
"One."  
  
Despite being eighteen years old the evil empress was as jittery as a little girl. "One thousand!?", she squealed.  
  
"No, one as in one single rider on a horse."  
  
The maiden felt like an arrow had been shot into her chest, an extra-large one so that her breasts wouldn't take the blow for her heart. "Just one?", she repeated.   
  
The little bird pondered for a moment. "Now that I think about it, it would be two including the horse."  
  
The empress let herself fall back on her throne. "Jeez, what a disappointment", she mumbled, her breasts jiggling in frustration. "The guards should easily take care of that �"  
  
"Don't take it so lightly!", the bird warned her, sounding strangely serious all of a sudden. "This is no ordinary intruder! On the back of the horse there was a flag fluttering in the wind, showing a candle with a white flame in the shape of a dove on it!"  
  
The evil empress sat up. "Really? The emblem of Sancti Luc�rna, the most powerful paladin Order in the world?" Her short burst of joy however quickly settled down. "Meh, why do you I even get excited? It's probably just some annoying recruit they want to get rid of�"  
  
"Actually, it's a legendary elite paladin feared in the whole world who has taken down entire kingdoms by herself."  
  
"Really? Oh. Okay, that's something-" The Dark Maiden paused. "Wait, did you say *her*self?"  
  
"Yep, it's a woman."  
  
"Oh crap!" Quickly the Dark Maiden stood up from her throne, seemingly panicked. "There is only one single female paladin in the entire world!"  
  
"I know, that's how I recognized her-"  
  
"Quick, we must prepare our defenses!", the maiden shouted. "How much time do we have until she arrives?"  
  
The wings of the gate were suddenly thrown open. The left one fell out of its angles and crashed into the floor, the impact causing some rubber to fall from the walls(and shaking the maiden's bosom a little). Through the half broken gate a young woman jumped into the throne room. She was wearing a bright silver armor, and held a long sword in one hand that looked like it was meant to be wielded with both hands. "Forces of evil and darkness, despair!", the intruder declared, raising the blade over her head. "I, the Holy Maiden of Sancti Luc�rna, have come to put an end to your dark rule!"  
  
The evil mistress looked at her pet. "You were only that much faster?"  
  
The little bird spread its wings out from its body. "Well, considering I'm a bird with fifteen centimeters wing span, I'm quite proud I could keep up with a galloping mustang."  
  
The Holy Maiden took a few steps into the room. Only her head was not covered by armor, showing her slightly tanned skin. The length and structure of her blonde hair were very similar to the Dark Maiden's white, as well as the intruder's face and figure beard a striking resemblance to hers(putting the chest part aside). The red eyes of the armored woman glared the entire time at the evil empress as she slowly approached her. "Evil empress of darkness!", the Holy Maiden yelled, pointing her sword at the Dark Maiden. "With my blade I shall slice your corrupted body apart and purify your soul! Prepare yourself!"  
  
The Dark Maiden sighed. "Nice to see you too, sister", she said, sitting down on her throne again.  
  
The bird tilted its head. "Somehow I'm not surprised by this turn of events, but to emphasize on the dramatic impact of this revelation I will still behave like I am totally shocked." After clearing its throat the bird screamed with exaggerated hysteria: "OH MY GOD, SHE'S YOUR SISTER!?"  
  
Lowering her sword the Holy Maiden stopped in the middle of the room, a slight smile on her face. "Well, well, it's been a while, little sister", she said, putting a hand on her waist. "How long has it been?"  
  
"Since the paladins took you away from father's castle ten years ago", the evil empress replied, looking sternly at the paladin. "And don't call me little!" She put her hands on the sides of her corset, squeezing her breasts a little together and making them flow further out of the leather's confines. "Doesn't quite fit anymore, wouldn't you agree?"  
  
The Holy Maiden began to walk up and down the room. "I wasn't surprised when I heard who the evil empress was that took over ten kingdoms in only a few months", she calmly spoke, "Even if it was just the garbage of the world. What startled me though was when I heard the rumors about *how* you did it: You, who already said at the ripe age of six years that this is a world dominated by men and we live in a society that suppresses women, the girl who always ran away from the castle to hang around with the boys in town, the probably most idealistic feminist in the entire world ended up as a big-bosomed slut." Quietly the paladin chuckled. "Isn't this kind of ironic?"  
  
"I don't need to be lectured by someone like you", the Dark Maiden responded coldly. "Not after what you have done."  
  
The Holy Maiden stopped. "What I have done?", she repeated. Her red eyes furiously glared at her sister. "*I* was taken away as a hostage, if you haven't forgotten, as a bait to put our father under pressure! And he, he couldn't protect me!"  
  
"Oh, poor little girl, weren't you?" The Dark Maiden returned the piercing glare of her sister with one full of hate. "Do you know how furious and depressed father was when the paladins kidnapped you? If his advisors had let him he would have gone right after them and taken you back! But this is Sancti Luc�rna we are talking about! You can't just walk to their fortress and say 'Hi, I'm an evil emperor, please give me my daughter back you took as a hostage'! After working for them so many years you should know how insanely powerful they are! But still, father never gave up on you: He spent three years gathering allies, forming alliances and building a force strong enough to attack their main fortress and rescue you so he could finally hold you in his arms again! Just when he was almost done with his preparations however, just before he was ready to declare war on one of the most terrifying organisations in the world, rumors suddenly came up - rumors about a dark princess that had left the path of evil. About a former hostage who had joined the Sancti Luc�rna years after being kidnapped by them. About a thirteen year-old girl that only after a few months of training had become first female paladin in history, and on top of that the youngest."  
  
"What are you trying to say?", the Holy Maiden asked. "That you are mad at me because I became good?"  
  
"No, I'm mad at you because you destroyed our family!", the Dark Maiden shouted. "When father found out his oldest daughter had become a knight of the light he practically lost his will to live! Even a year later he was nothing but a walking zombie, and of course completely unable to rule his empire! Bit by bit it fell into the hands of backstabbers and rebels! Father couldn't even defend us when the castle was surrounded by enemies from all sides! Mother had no other choice but to leave him and take us into another kingdom of darkness. But the king, a "friend" of our father wouldn't let us in � not before my mother agreed to marry him, this disgusting old�" The Dark Maiden paused, shuddering. "And if I hadn't run away a year ago, he would have married me next!"  
  
Covering his red eyes with his wings the little bird sobbed. "What a tragic story!", it cried.   
  
The Holy Maiden seemed less impressed. "Are you done?", she asked a little annoyed. "I still have to slay a dragon and save a princess from the clutches of an evil mage today, so I'd like to kill you in the next half hour."  
  
The bird removed its wings from its face, looking irritated at the paladin. "You are going to kill your own sister?", it asked.  
  
"It's her own fault!", she replied. "She could have sworn off evil a long time ago and followed the way of light and goodness, just like me!"  
  
"But you're about to kill her!", the bird argued. "Wouldn't it be more like the way of light and goodness if you tried to convince her changing sides by calling out to the good in her soul?"  
  
The Holy Maiden shrugged. "I'm a fanatic. We have a little different ways to settle things."  
  
"She was always extreme, even when we were children", the Dark Maiden chimed in. "While I had enough fun stomping on the ants in our castle she wasn't satisfied until she found their nest and flooded it with weird chemicals she stole from the alchemist's lab."  
  
"You are just too soft, sister", the holy maiden told her.  
  
"Kind of funny seeing who of us turned out to be the bad guy, isn't it?"  
  
"Mom and Dad always loved you more than me!"  
  
"Oh come on, don't bring out such clich�s! And you are just jealous because I got a pony on my sixth birthday."  
  
"I have every right to be! I only got a pair of new boots on my sixth birthday!"  
  
"Magical boots of godly blessed speed�"  
  
"I WOULDN'T HAVE NEEDED SPEED SHOES IF I HAD A PONY!"   
  
The bird shook its tiny head. "The fate of hundreds of people is on the line, and they talk about ponies and shoes", it sighed. "Why did the emancipation ever have to make its way into the eternal struggle between good and evil?"  
  
Suddenly the paladin grabbed the hilt of her sword with both hands, and took a fighting stance. "Enough of this!", she declared. "I shall now slice you apart with my blessed blade of purity, you and your little� black,  um� bird� thing�"  
  
"I'm a canary bird of doom! How come nobody knows this species?"  
  
"Whatever, you'll soon be extinct anyway!"  
  
"Not so fast, sister!" The Dark Maiden stood up, hands on her hips, legs spread apart, her violet eyes beaming with determination. "Though I am not really proud of how I did it, I managed to conquer ten kingdoms and build up an empire, all by myself! And before I have washed the name of our family clean and restored our honor in the world so mother can finally leave this bastard of a husband I won't ever surrender to anybody! You may be my sister and a famous paladin feared even by dragons and mages, but I will still defend my empire with everything I got!" She held out her hand. "Quick, give me my frying pan!"  
  
There was a moment of silence. The only things that could be hear were the wind and thunder outside of the castle.  
  
"�Did that just sound as stupid as I think?", the Dark Maiden asked.  
  
"I don't think you can really fathom the stupidity of your words, my dear", the bird told its mistress.   
  
The Holy Maiden raised her sword above her head. "Ready or not, here I come!" With a loud battle cry the holy paladin charged towards the Dark Maiden. Her raging screams echoed through the castle, making the evil empress shiver slightly. Her courage dropped to the floor as helplessly searched for something that could save her. When the Holy Maiden was right in front of her she closed her eyes, preparing herself to get sliced in half.  
  
"Head down!" Without thinking the evil empress immediately ducked, the quick move making her breasts slap against her chin. Hovering behind her the bird flew forward and from its claws threw an array of small objects towards the paladin. Her battle cry abruptly ended as they landed into her mouth, making her stop in her tracks. Startled she instinctively swallowed the load, blinking a few times in surprise. "Y-you insolent little spawns of darkness!", she shouted angrily. She shook her head, still a little perplexed, slowly recognizing the taste of the projectiles. "If you think some chestnuts are enough to stop me�" Mid-sentence she suddenly stopped. The anger in her face disappeared, turning into a mixture of confusion and worry. "W-what is this feeling?", she asked, waving air towards her face. "I-is it getting hotter in here?"  
  
The Dark Maiden straightened up again. "Hey, smart move!", she congratulated her pet, smiling as her sister put a hand on her armor.   
  
"Thanks", it said, landing on her shoulder. "Though I had hoped she would choke on them and suffocate."  
  
The Holy Maiden stumbled backwards. Her face had become a little pale, looking like she was about to get sick, while she pressed her hands against the metal plate on her chest. "W-what have you done to me?", she screamed.   
  
With the tides having turned the Dark Maiden confidently raised her head, smirking deviously towards her sister. "Nothing that will kill you", she assured her. Slowly she walked around the female paladin, who was giving her a half fearful and half angry glare. "But if I was you, I would strip out of that armor � or at least the breastplate."   
  
The Holy Maiden wanted to say something, but froze. Beneath her silver breast plate, inside her chain mail and loose linen top she wore underneath her armor she could feel a swelling sensation inside her chest, alongside a small prickle. She blinked a few times, looking down on her armor as if she could see through it at her body. Something was pressing against it from the inside. It wasn't like something had been put into her armor though, it was more like... like�   
  
It took a while until the Holy Maiden realised that her chest itself pressed against her armor, rounding out and rising outwards. The plain flesh around her breast warts slowly ascended and bulged out from her body. "D-don't tell me�", she whispered. A loud banging could be heard as the Maiden dropped her sword, the maiden's face turning pale as the snow. She ripped off the shoulder plates from her armor, and hastily began to remove the armor around her arms. While she took of one piece after another the tingle around her chest intensified, the surface of her breasts increasing as they steadily blew up. As the last parts of her arm protection fell to the ground, revealing the long sleeves of her chain mail and bare hands the Holy Maiden hastily pulled her breast plate over her head. With a loud crash she dropped it to the ground, her jaw almost falling out of her skull as she looked at her unarmored body. Around her chest there was a small bump in her chainmail, as if two ripe apples had been put into it. Adding to her shock she could see the bump was slowly reaching out from her, its ascent steadily growing rounder and dividing itself into two smaller bumps. Taking a step back the Holy Maiden searched for something to hold onto. "You� I� this�", was all she could stutter.   
  
The Dark Maiden grinned evilly as she watched her sister "bloom". "What's wrong, sis?", she asked provocatively, slowly marching over to her. The Holy Maiden, still at loss for words, simply looked down in disbelief. The strong grip of her chainmail held her assets pretty stout, but somehow the Holy Maiden could feel that even without it her breasts would have kept their firm structure. While the iron rings rattled slightly from moving over her increasing bosom her linen under-top stretched beneath, groaning slightly as it was wrapped around her bust. Its tightly tied bodice widened a little as it was pushed forward, and the inner sides of her breasts slowly grew into the narrow gap of her shirt. As the inner slopes of her breasts began to dock onto one another the Holy Maiden had to inhale sharply. Despite the pleasurable feeling though no enjoyment built up inside her, but only rage, and to a certain amount shame that brought some colour back into her face. "R-ridiculous!", the Holy Maiden choked, glaring in disgust at her bloating chest. Now it didn't look like apples had been put into her chainmail but pears, large round pears that were constantly growing larger. "Y-you really think something like that can stop-" Something soft suddenly pressed against her back, a fleshy substance that almost completely covered her entire upper back and slightly spilled against her neck. At the same time a pair of hands slid under her arms, and before the Holy Maiden could react they had grabbed the bulging parts of her chainmail. Throwing her head back the paladin threw out a gasp as the hands cupped her growing breasts, trying to massage them through the metal. "W-what in the name of light are you doing?!", she half shouted, half moaned.   
  
The Dark Maiden glanced over the shoulder of the paladin. "Oh, nothing", she said innocently, but with an evil grin on her face. She leaned a little closer to the Holy Maiden's ear, pressing her own breasts against her back while she ran her fingers softly over her sister's rack. "Just helping you enjoy it", she whispered with a voice as sweet as honey. The blush of the Holy Maiden deepened as the hands of the evil empress stroke over her chainmail, creating a reaction even through it on her sensitive skin. With gentle movements the fingers followed the bulging course of her curves, causing the Holy Maiden to breath heavier. The empress moved her hands over the slightly sagging bottom of her breasts, then up the arching fronts that steadily swelled forward until her hands reached their rising tops, stroking them for a few seconds before they wandered towards the flaring flanks of the bosom. Soft moans erupted from the Holy Maiden, overturning that a string of her linen top had just snapped. Her squeezed breast flesh pushed against the bodice with increasing force while flowing against the palms of the evil empress. "Wow sis, you're really getting a nice pair of boobs there", the Dark Maiden giggled. She rubbed her at least three times larger piles of flesh over her sister's back. "But you'll still need some more to catch up to me." Grinding her teeth the paladin wanted to say something, but instead bit her lip as her sister began to grope her bosom, squeezing it rather roughly through the chainmail. The pressure inside her linen top increased, breaking another string and therefore widening the gap of her bodice further. Sporting a small line of cleavage underneath the chainmail the Holy Maiden felt as her top tried to rise up her belly, but got kept at its place by her chainmail. Only the top of her bosom managed to slip out of the fabric, testing the will force of the maiden further as a rising amount of her bare breast skin came into contact with cold iron. Feeling the fabric glide over her bulging curves, the metal rings pressing into her sensitive skin and her sister's hand gently fondling her bosom completely overwhelmed the paladin, her red eyes looking helplessly up at the ceiling. She looked like she was short before exploding either from rage, or from pleasure.   
  
One by one the strings of her undershirt broke apart. Each snap caused the rift in her top to grow a little wider, freeing more tight cleavage as her burgeoning bust pulled on the linen. Even the hard chainmail couldn't keep the fabric from rising up her body anymore, the hem of her top slowly gliding over her belly while at the same time unveiling her bosom from the top, leaving more and more for only her chainmail to cover. The Holy Maiden winced as the rings pressed against her bare skin, leaving small imprints, while her sister continued to massage her soft meat buns. Looking straight down the paladin could watch her breasts steadily rising up towards her neck, and tried to find a comparison to their size. She remembered once seeing a variety of foreign fruits on the market of a faraway kingdom that were called "melons", one of them being nicknamed honeydew melon. She guessed the current size of her breasts around those, and silently hoped this would stop before she reached "water melons", the largest fruit she had seen on that market. Beneath her chainmail stitches were creaking, threads were popping and yarn was ripping as her top bit by bit dissolved. A jagged tear appeared on the right side of her bosom, gradually growing deeper and wider under her rising curvature, while at the same time the last string of her bodice broke apart. Her top slid a little deeper, the rim of the fabric resting just above her breast warts, only kept in place by the tight chainmail lying above it. The solid metal plate had stretched surprisingly well over her bosom, but once it had been filled out began to restrain her flesh on its way outwards. Though still globular the shape of her breasts began to deform a little, her skin folding slightly as her chainmail refused to give any more room. One more time the Dark Maiden moved her hands over the full voluptuousness of her sister's curves, and after giving them one last squeeze let go of them, the Holy Maiden feeling as her humongous breasts left her back. "Wow, how many chestnuts did you give her?", the evil empress asked, chuckling as she walked around her sister to get a better look at her rack.   
  
"I think I only threw about four or five into her mouth", the black bird replied. It set off from the Dark Maiden's shoulder, flying towards the Holy Maiden's chest until it hovered only a peak-length away from her swelling mammaries. Through the rings of her chainmail it could roughly see her cleavage pressing outwards, reaching out like a maw that would consume everything in its path. "But stackable curses often have a higher potency if casted multiple times simultaneously on the same target", it said after flying in front of the growing bosom for a while. "So she could end up as big as you, mistress, maybe even bigger."  
  
"What?! Bigger than that cow?!", the Holy Maiden screamed. "You little-!" Just in time the bird avoided a strike from her right hand. Abruptly she froze as her breasts swayed slightly inside her chainmail, their bounces putting the linen top under even more stress. The rigidity of the metal forced her quaking flesh to pile up inside the way too tight chainmail, forming wrinkles all around her bosom that looked meaty bubbles. What was left of her linen top got pulled into the wrinkles, leading rip after rip to go over the tight fabric. "Ugh�" The legs of the paladin were shaking as her breasts flowed almost unhindered against the chainmail, while her body began to lean slightly forward. "O-only a f-freak like you could do something like- GAH!" Again the Holy Maiden gasped as the bird suddenly bumped against her right breast. Her compressed flesh quivered and jolted, causing the iron rings to rattle slightly. She took a step back, going a little more into her knees. Meanwhile the bird flew circles in front of her, seeming a bit disorientated.   
  
"T-that wasn't nearly as fun as I thought it would be", it stammered. "Ma-make a note I shall never again try to fly into a bosom t-that is protected by an iron ch-ch-chainmail." The evil empress sighed.  
  
The paladin wrapped her arms around her breasts to calm them, panting in exhaustion. "S-stupid tweetie!", she shouted, but in a low voice. "D-did you really think you c-could break a solid iron chainmail, c-crafted by the most talented dwarven blacksmiths of San-"   
  
The Holy Maiden was cut off by a loud bang coming from her chest, followed by the sound of a small metal object rolling over the floor. The Holy Maiden stood still for a few seconds, before she looked down at the chainmail wrapped around her packed bosom. Her eyes almost fell out of her head as she saw a ring was missing at the center of her chest. "N-no way...!"   
  
The grin of the Dark Maiden grew into eerie dimensions. "Hehe, looks like things are gonna get really fun now, right?" As she looked for her pet though the empress found it sitting next to her on the ground, its whole body slumped. "What's wrong?"  
  
"She called me tweetie", the bird sobbed, hanging its head. "Tweetie�"  
  
While the evil empress picked the bird up to comfort it her sister still looked at the hole in her chainmail in disbelief. Her whole armor rattled and crackled, shaking over her bosom. The small gaps between the rings began to extend, some even began to stick out slightly. "I- impossible!", she screeched. Another loud bang suddenly echoed through the hall, quickly followed by another one. To the maiden's disbelief the iron rings of her chainmail one by one broke off, creating a growing gap in the middle of her bosom. The Holy Maiden shrieked as ring after ring was shot through the throne room. The more pressure was released the further her breasts reached out from her, flowing through the gap that formed on its front. Firm cleavage squeezed through it as her flesh spread out, the bruised skin smoothing in the fresh air. While the tear extended upwards pretty fast, revealing a growing amount of her bosom, only a few rings popped off downwards, creating an almost pointed tip. Between the bangs one could hear her linen top shredding apart, some pieces falling out of the growing gap from time to time. After a while it wasn't enough anymore for her bust to break her mail ring by ring, but instead began to shoot off larger pieces: Two connected rings, three connected rings, five connected rings, eight connected rings, and so on. The tear in her chainmail ripped higher and larger, showing off a deep and firm cleavage as it revealed the top of her bosom. Feeling the flesh spill out of her chainmail the Holy Maiden almost dropped to her knees, barely able to fight down the impulses that were going through her. She couldn't hold back though a roaring moan that sounded like the rutting call of a wild animal. The paladin's head shined bright red, silently cursing her behaviour.  
  
As the popping of metal began to slow down she nervously looked at her chainmail. Around her neck it was still intact, but where her breasts bulged out there was a large heart-shaped tear, and a pair of fleshy, wobbling pumpkins inside it. She whimpered at the size of her humungous hooters, each already a tad bigger than her sister's � and still growing. The amount of skin exposed was also horrendous and far above what the dress code of her Order allowed: The tear went from below her shoulders in a soft curve over the slopes of her breasts, barely covering her nipples as it ended in a sharp peak slightly above the end of her bosom, showing off more than a foot of squeezing cleavage. Despite the size of the tear her breasts were still rather conserved inside the chainmail, the free flesh spilling an entire inch over the edges and almost reaching up to her chin. And as her breasts continued to push outward she could watch them rise steadily higher, swelling outwards, piling up and breaking more rings from her chainmail. A few remnants of her under-top rested scattered between her mail and her bosom, tickling her sensitive skin a little as the swelling caused them to move slightly. More and more her back buckled under the weight it had to carry, and only their sensitivity stopped the maiden from holding her breasts up with her arms. The top of her pink areola came into sight as her chainmail slowly glided lower, moving over her bulging bosom. When her heavy mounds were just noticeably larger than those of the Dark Maiden no more rings popped off her chainmail. A few seconds later and the only movements her breasts made came from her breathing. "Well, guess the fun's over now �at least for us", the Dark Maiden laughed. The bird flew from its mistress' hand as she crossed her arms below her breasts, causing them to spill a little further through the bodice of her corset. "But you still have a lot more pleasure to discover, sis. Shall we give you a hand at it?"  
  
The paladin stared at the ground, panting. Her chainmail creaked at every of her breaths, the giant swells of flesh inside it quaking at every move. The evil empress took much joy in watching her sister's bust sway and wobble while almost spilling out of her armor, so much that she didn't notice she was reaching for her sword. "I� I�", the Holy Maiden stuttered. Her fingers found the knob of her sword, and quickly embraced it. "I'M GONNA KILL YOU", she screamed, jumping on her feet. More rings popped off as she charged at the Dark Maiden, raising the blade over her head.   
  
"Wha- wait!", the Dark Maiden screamed, her own breasts bouncing as she backed off. She had not expected her sister to recover so fast. Unfolding her arms she held them in front of her face, closing her eyes as the paladin swung her sword. Just as it was about to hit her head and split it in two a gleam suddenly appeared around both women. Two blue bubbles of energy popped up, engulfing them and keeping the paladin from slicing her sister apart as the two force fields pushed each other back. Before any of the maidens knew what was happening they were thrown backwards into opposite directions, the hall and their bosoms shaking as both crashed into a wall. The bodice of the Dark Maiden broke apart, leading her corset to open completely and reveal her naked grey orbs. Immediately she put her arms around her bosom to hide at least her more intimidate areas, blushing while she wondered if she should moan in pleasure or groan in pain from the impact. Simultaneously the Holy Maiden's chainmail broke at the bottom, the lower slopes of her breasts dangling as they were suddenly revealed. An array of iron rings danced over the floor, her armor having broken so far only two triangle-shaped parts covered her bosom around her breast warts and at the sides. Aside from that one could gaze at every detail of the paladin's firm rack, from their round form to the squeezing valley between them, each sphere around the size of a large pumpkin and looking almost as solid as one. "Ugh� w-what was that?", the paladin asked, rubbing her aching head(and trying to ignore her tingling bust).  
  
Still covering herself the Dark Maiden grabbed the sides of her corset. "Beats me", she said as she pulled the leather back over her curves, trying to knot the broken strings back together.  
  
"Jeez, don't you girls know anything about sorcery?", the bird asked annoyed. The two maidens watched as it flew to the throne and sat down on top of it, next to the bowl with the chestnuts. "Stackable curses become more effective if casted multiple times on the same target because they absorb mana from the environment"; it began to explain. "The more stacks, the more mana is absorbed, and the more effective the curse is. But at the same time this leads the body of the cursed to radiate mana itself, and the more stacks are added the more concentrated the emission becomes. If a certain amount is passed a magical field will form around the cursed. And it's one of the BASICS of magic that magical fields of the same kind automatically repel each other if they get too close."  
  
"You mean like magnets?", its mistress asked.  
  
"What's a magnet?"  
  
"�You don't know what a magnet is and scold us for not knowing about the repelling attributes of stackable curses?"  
  
"I'm a talking bird, not a talking lexicon, okay?"  
  
The Holy Maiden slowly dragged herself up the wall, careful not to lose balance. "D-don't think that will stop me!", she shouted, pointing her sword at the Dark Maiden. "I-", she paused a moment because the swaying of her breasts irritated her "I will lift his curse and-"  
  
"That's impossible", the Dark Maiden cut her off, closing the first string of her corset. "I called a shaman and a priest to inspect that curse already. Both told me that it can't be lifted, but will only perish over time."   
  
The Holy Maiden snorted, half amused, half angry. "Yeah, maybe for some hillbillies from the end of the world! The priests in the Order will surely-"  
  
"Actually", the Dark Maiden interrupted her again "The shaman is a sage with thousands of followers all around the world who has come to this calm region to meditate, and the priest was a former arch priest who was sent here into exile as the result of a political intrigue."  
  
A bit baffled the Holy Maiden stared at her sister. "�How long?", she asked after a while.  
  
The Dark Maiden shrugged. "For me, they estimated around ten years."  
  
"WHAT?!" The Dark Maiden almost jumped in rage. "I will NOT wait ten years to kill you!", she shouted, now fully ignoring the wild movements of her chest. "And I will not walk around with these damn things for so long! I�I�" She paused, looking like she had remembered something. "Wait� I've got it!", she screamed. "I'll just brew the potion of infinite possibilities and wish the curse would be gone!"   
  
Still fumbling on her corset the Dark Maiden rolled her eyes. "Oh come on, that potion that grants any wish is just a�"  
  
"SHUT UP! I have to remember the ingredients." The Holy Maiden began to move up and down, causing her breasts to do the same. "Okay, first I need the blood of an amazon queen, taken from a wound pierced with her own crown. Then I have to get the horns of a hundred minotaurs, cut off with a sacred sword, as well as the beard of the strongest dwarf, and then� Wait, how shall I know which dwarf is the strongest?... I know, I'll just kill a few hundreds of their elite soldiers and take all their beards! All right, once I have everything I just need to stir the ingredients with a scepter from the treasure of the giants inside the holy well of the elven capitol during full moon, drink a sip from the mixture and state my wish. Then my boobs will shrink down to normal size again and I can finally purify your soul by slicing your body apart!"  
  
Standing up from the ground the Dark Maiden shook her head. She was about to tell her sister this magical elixir was nothing but a myth, a tale mothers told their children as bedtime stories, but then frowned. "Wait, did you say the blood of an amazon queen, the horns of a hundred minotaurs, the beard of the strongest dwarf, the treasure of the giants and the well in the elven capitol?"  
  
"Yes, why?"  
  
"Oh, just asking." She held back a giggle, turning her head away from her sister so she wouldn't see her grin. "Actually, you are quite lucky: The kingdoms of all these are in direct neighborhood to my empire. If you depart immediately, you might even make it to the country of amazons before dawn."  
  
But her sister had already "bounced" out of the room. Shortly afterwards the empress and her pet could hear the neighing of her horse, followed by the quick clapping of hooves.  
  
"Not shabby, my dear", the little bird complimented its mistress. It set up from the throne, flying circles through the hall for a while before it sat back down on its perch. "Especially telling her the curse is impossible to lift."  
  
"It wasn't a complete lie", she grinned. "They said it would go away after ten years by itself. She just doesn't need to know they both offered me an immediate cure, which is just way too expensive for me."  
  
"Do you think she'll find out?"  
  
Smiling confidently the dark empress closed the last strings of her leather corset. Her bust hopped a little as she victoriously stuck out her chest. "If she hasn't changed from back when we were kids, she will first try out every ridiculous legend about ultimate items of unlimited super-blah and go on a wild rampage through half of the world before she begins to think. And from all the tales I've heard about her, I think she's still much like back when we were kids." The empress strode through the room, suddenly strangely proud of the slight bounces her breasts made with every step. "Give message to my generals: They shall send troops to the countries once my sister is done with them and eliminate the remaining resistances!"  
  
"How many soldiers shall they sent?", the bird asked. The Dark Maiden walked over to a window. At the path that led up to her castle she could watch her sister galloping away on her horse at a fast pace. Even from the distance she could see the rage in her ride, and for a moment even believed to see her breasts bouncing up and down as she rode.   
  
"Five should be enough", she smirked. "But tell them we also need new guards for the gate."

Sequel to "The dark side of BE" [[link]](http://fav.me/d3b6g4h) , even though the main character from it doesn't get BE'd this time.  
  
Originally I intented to let the paladin's entire armor break, but eventually found that would have been a bit over-the-top.  
  
Of course it's not any more realistic if a chainmail breaks from the pressure of a pair of rapidly growing boobs, but it *seems* more plausible, doesn't it?  
  
Enjoy^^

Oh boy here comes the engineer.  
For iron to actually break and not just bend or change shape, it needs to be under pressure of about 150 MegaPascals (If we say it is only vertical force with no momentum). This is 150 Newtons per cube-millimeter. Well there is more to it, it is hard to say anything concrete without exact cross-section study and such, but to illustrate this to you, let me give you an example. Let's say you have a hand of 14 cm long and 7 cm wide. This is 98 cube-centimeters. 150 MPa on this hand would equal to having someone putting about 150 TONS of weight on said hand.  
  
So yeah, I know this is a fantasy story of women growing big breasts but then again, I'm an engineer.

right chainmail there are two/ three varients butted where there is four open rings threaded through a solid ring and then bent together till the two ends meet. Rivited ring mail (similar but overlap and a rivet is put through to secure it, then finally flat section riveted which is some of the best armour of its type craftable

Butted mail is made by taking the open rings, threading them together, heating the tips, and pressing the tips together to make a solid, smooth ring. This is opposed to riveted mail, where the tips are flattened sideways, holes are made in the flattened part, they are threaded into the mail, the ring is squased until the holes line up, and a small, hot piece of metal is placed in the holes and flattened to seal it. Butted mail is weaker, but smoother and less irritating than riveted, which has the hard edges of the flattened parts and the rivets.  
By the way, all of this was completely taken from Google searches, so in addition to the awesome, sexy, and funny story, thanks for spurring me to learn about armor crafting techniques.

Yeah, man. And this chapter is helped quite a bit by the fact that chicks in armor are hot.  
  
Anyway  
  
I'm kind of wondering what kind of genetics led to the Dark Maiden having gray skin and white hair and the Holy Maiden being normal for both.

Gray skin, white hair and unnatural eye-colours are typical traits for people who grow up in evil kingdoms due to the air being polluted by the magic from demon summonings, dark spells and so on. When the holy maiden was younger she had thos traits too, but during her time as a paladin she was often under the influence of holy light which cleared the "smog" out of her body, and therefore her body slowly changed into a more natural appearance. She's stuck with the red eyes though.  
  
And yes, chicks in armors are hot ![:P](./I3reacl_files/=p.gif ":P (Lick)")

There was no bitterness, no dregs- just your heart poured out.

**Phone Call BE**"I can't believe this guy!"  
  
Amanda shut the door behind her, all small objects in her apartment shaking at the impact. "How he can turn down me, Amanda Manor, the probably hottest girl in entire high school!? I prepared so hard for this: I made my hair for two hours, tanned my skin in the solar studio and put on the smallest, tightest jeans skirt I could fit in!" Putting her hands into her tank-top she pulled two bundles of cotton out of her bra, reducing her cup-size to a modest B. "I even stuffed my bra more than usually", she sighed. "Now how shall I get a date until Friday?"  
  
After throwing the cotton away she grabbed her telephone, push](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Phone-Call-BE-187436187)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**A special treat**It was a beautiful spring day, warm sunlight streaming into the large, Victorian mansion. A little, six-year old girl was walking down the floor, looking rather grumpy. "I'm SOOOO bored!", she mourned, her long, baggy skirt waggling from side to side. With each step, the silver ornaments on her purple dress knocked against her body, a feeling she had gotten used to though. Not knowing what to do, the little princess yawned, stretching her arms out from her body. Her sleeves ended in white collars, flounced like her skirt, covering the lower half of her hands while leaving free view on her tiny fingers.  
  
Suddenly, the girl stopped. Around the](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/A-special-treat-180160430) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**In retrospect...**Sarah stared into her glass, blushing slightly. With the straw she drew circles on the surface of her juice, nervously shifting around on her chair. �Sooo, how do you feel?", she asked, not looking up from her glass.  
  
�Like a milk-cow", the woman next to her said. Around them, Sarah could hear the whispers of the other guests at the street caf�, constantly glaring over to their table. People passing on the street gazed towards them, their eyes nearly popping out of their heads. �You know, one of those genetically modified with the fat udders."  
  
Silently, Sarah took a sip from her orange juice � coincidentally, &#](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/In-retrospect-202581465)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**A Hardware Upgrade**Since she was a child Jean had always loved flying. Though it was over twenty years ago she could still remember the first time when she had entered a plane. She was so nervous she had hold tightly to the arm of her mother the entire time on the airport, and once they sat inside immediately grabbed the leans of her seat. When the plane took off she almost screamed, and couldn't calm down until the signs for the seatbelts had gone off. But as she dared a look outside the window after a while and stared at the sea of white fluffy clouds and the beautiful landscape beneath the plane all her fear was immediately replaced with utter awe.

**Short and Sweet**Lilly wasn't really a snoopy girl. But when she coincidentally witnessed as her mother received a package at the garden gate from the postman, and then went back into the house, acting all secret as if she wanted nobody to see her bringing some package into the house, and when Lilly afterwards spotted her putting a load of red bonbons from the package into a jar that she hid on top of the highest shelf in the kitchen, it was enough to make the short girl move a chair under said shelf, put a pile of books on top of it and step onto the books to reach for the jar.  
  
"Come on", Lilly murmured. She raised herself on the very tips of her toes, stre](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Short-and-Sweet-306536048)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Curse of the Dark Maiden**Once upon a time in a world that is not ours, there was a dark, deserted wasteland far away from any kind of civilisation. In the most outside corner of that wasteland stood a huge, rocky mountain, surrounded by an eternal thunderstorm. No sunshine ever reached the ground there � the only plants that grew here were dead trees and grey grass. Truly, it was the most unpleasant place in the entire world, a place no human would have ever wanted to live at. Nevertheless, a big Gothic castle had been built on top of that mountain, seemingly inhabited aside from the swarms of night creatures that resided here.  
  
But behind its crumbling walls a](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Curse-of-the-Dark-Maiden-200175137) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**The genie from the milk bottle**There weren't many people who could open a door with their feet, but Amanda was one of them.  
  
Holding the key between her toes the young woman put it into the keyhole, bending a little backwards. She had to be careful nothing would fall out of the box she was carrying in her arms. �That was a good day", she said to herself, looking at all the plastic items, cans and other garbage she had collected. �I can make a lot out of this stuff!"  
  
With little effort she tilted the key around, opening the door. Her apartment looked like one would expect it from a 24-year old woman, maybe a bit larger than the average. The greatest difference be](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/The-genie-from-the-milk-bottle-196457100)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**30k Birthday Celebration**There wasn't really much to associate with the number 30. One of the bloodiest wars in history lasted 30 years, some months have 30 days, and according to Wikipedia there was a band called "30 Odd foot of grunts", but it really isn't a special number. So as Gina turned into the driveway of her home she told herself it was no big deal today was her 30th birthday.  
  
Gina parked in front of her garage, looking at the clock before she shut down the engine. 7pm � it had really been a long day of work. Not that she minded it, she liked her work. And that way, she was able to distract herself a little. Her colleagues had also made it easy for he](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/30k-Birthday-Celebration-268587999)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Dear Dairy**Dear Dairy,  
  
Whoops, typo! But it's kind of funny. Maybe I'll start all my diary entries like that? ;P  
  
Anyway, since quite a few things have happened lately in my life and I don't have anyone right now to talk to (at least yet) I guessed I could start a diary. Of yourse� again a typo, but this one happens actually quite a lot to me ^\_^; Anyway, of yourse it's not like I don't have any friends or a family. Right now, they're all just a few hundred miles away from me. I moved away from home a few days ago for college, and don't know many people here yet. And I'm not really the kind of person who likes to talk all day on the telephone. But](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Dear-Dairy-293882315)

**April's Big Day**April's Big Day  
  
April was cleaning around the house since she was going to have company over today. She had met a woman named Sabrina not very long ago, and had invited her over for lunch. April figured it'd be a good way to get to know more about Sabrina.  
  
Two of April's friends, Clara and Katrina, had introduced her to Sabrina the other day. The cool thing about Clara and Katrina was that they were witches, and could pretty much do anything they wanted; they were also twins.  
  
April had to admit though, that she did have this one thought about kissing Clara; she wondered what it'd be like. Clara was extremely cute and was ve](http://blueberryjanelle.deviantart.com/art/April-s-Big-Day-191673895)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Itsy Bitsy Bikini**An empty shopping bag sat on the floor next to Ariel's pile of clothes. She stood in the dressing room completely naked, staring at her reflection and holding up her new bikini. It was yellow with white spots, and absolutely tiny. The two small triangular patches of cloth were flimsily held together by a few pieces of skimpy yellow rope. The bottoms, although the tags said they would fit Ariel's size 6 body, looked like they might have come from the children's section.  
  
She never would have considered wearing something so skimpy under normal circumstances, but today it was her goal to stand out.  
  
She wouldn't have even bought the two piece if](http://inflator.deviantart.com/art/Itsy-Bitsy-Bikini-256341007)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**April takes on the town BE**April stood in the middle of her bedroom before a full size mirror that hung off her closet door. She turned from side to side, frowning at the small curves that were just barely visible through her night gown. She knew they didn't have to be that way. She discovered that with a simple thought they could grow! Oh and how wonderful it felt to have them expand on her chest. She never made them too big though, and they would always return back to their regular size. It wasn't that they couldn't go any further, it was just she was afraid that she might lose control.  
  
But today would be different, today she wanted to see how big they could go! She](http://ginbug.deviantart.com/art/April-takes-on-the-town-BE-191399372)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)

"Okay, so everything is ready. When did Clara say she'd be back?"  
  
"She said she was going to take Janelle shopping for a little while to give us time to set up here. She'll be here any minute," Jess replied.  
  
Sabrina walked over to the window and looked through it as she bent over a little, both Jess and Katrina staring at her ass with smiles on their faces.  
  
"So anyways, what did you and Clara get for her?" asked Jess.  
  
"Hehe, you'll see soon enough, Jess," Katrina smiled.  
  
"They're here!"  
  
Sabrina hid behind the chair, and Katrina and Jess hid behind the couch. There was the sound of keys knocking against the d](http://blueberryjanelle.deviantart.com/art/Birthday-BE-176689756)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)

"I'm going into the kitchen to grab a bite to eat, and make Katrina a sandwich. You need anything?"  
  
"No thanks, Clara. I'm good."  
  
Clara nodded and walked off into the kitchen. Kylie walked to the Potion Room where she found Katrina muttering to herself as she poured liquid into a big round cauldron that was in the center of the room.  
  
Katrina grabbed a bottle off the shelf and walked up to the cauldron. She looked at the bottle in her hand, and thought to herself for a moment. She must have calculated something in her mind, Kylie thought. Katrina slowly poured the contents that were in the bottle into th](http://blueberryjanelle.deviantart.com/art/Kylie-s-Milky-Situation-199712794)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Busty Desires: Part Two**Busty Desires  
Part Two  
  
We all watched as Sabrina's breasts started growing; slowly but surely, her shirt's wrinkles smoothed out as her chest was making itself known. Sabrina always had nice pair of breasts; she loved to show them off whenever she could, and loved the attention she got when people drooled over them, especially her cleavage. She took care of her body, which was why Sabrina got so many eyes looking in her direction. She was very beautiful.  
  
Sabrina wasn't the type to call people names, or make fun of them because they didn't look as pretty. Sometimes she'd joke around, but she honestly had no intentions of](http://blueberryjanelle.deviantart.com/art/Busty-Desires-Part-Two-207960046)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)

Part Three  
  
Kylie looked at the banana in her hand, then back up at Sabrina.  
  
"Aren't you going to eat it? Look how big Clara's tits got. Don't you want to have some fun too?" Sabrina gestured over at Clara and as she turned her head, she gave Clara a smile and a wink. Clara's cheeks turned red.  
  
"But this is the last banana!" Kylie looked around at everyone.  
  
"We can always make more, silly. Speaking of which, Katrina, whip up some more bananas. I'll go drop them into the cauldron."  
  
Katrina snapped her fingers, and a hand of bananas appeared in her hands. She handed them over to Sabrina who smiled and walk](http://blueberryjanelle.deviantart.com/art/Busty-Desires-Part-Three-208825088)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)

Everyone stood around me in a circle. There was no way for me to escape.  
  
"Hold her down!" Sabrina ordered.  
  
Clara, Kylie, Pandora, and Katrina brought me down to the floor with ease, while Pandora and Kylie pinned my arms to the floor and Clara sat on my belly while she looked down with a giggle, "Hey, there!"  
  
"Here, feed her the bananas!"  
  
Sabrina handed Katrina the four bananas that were left, and unpeeled one. I kept my mouth closed and turned away.  
  
"Janelle's not going to eat them," Clara said sadly.  
  
"I have an idea." Katrina whispered under her breath as she cast one of her spells. She smiled, "Now Janel](http://blueberryjanelle.deviantart.com/art/Busty-Desires-Part-Four-209773365)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Expanding Lingerie**Josie was about to start college and wanted some new clothes and underwear before she started her new life.  
She went to the mall and checked out the department store. Finding clothes for Josie was always easy because of her thin build. She had cute 32b cups breast, and 34" waist. The blonde picked up a few clothes, then got a cute red bra and panties she liked and went into the dressing room.  
As Josie took off her clothes and tried the lingerie, she liked the feel and look the red bra and panties gave her in the mirror, but she noticed some itching on her boobs and ass shortly after putting on the underwear. She then tried on some jeans, bu](http://citizenbjm.deviantart.com/art/Expanding-Lingerie-306081634)

 The morning sun crept out below the horizon, spreading its dim light over the niveous landscape. Flying over the white plains its rays reached a small house on the edge of a small town, where they shone through a small window right into the room of a small girl. Since it was quite early the dark-skinned child slept soundly inside her bed when the warm light hit her face. Slowly, she began to open her maroon eyes, groaning a little. Her black curls fell into her face, the little ribbons on top of each appearing as blurry red spots in her sight. At first, she wanted to turn around and sleep on � if necessary, she would even stand up and pull down the drapes. It was way too early to stand up, the small girl thought, peeking at to the clock. As her eyes rolled over to the night table she also threw a casual glance at her calender, seeing it still showed the date of yesterday:  
  
December 24th   
  
Immediately she pulled off the blanket from her body, all tiredness gone. Wide awake the small girl jumped out of her bed, dashing towards the door. Once she opened it however she calmed down a little, remembering her parents weren't awake yet. Quietly, she began to sneak through the floor, trying to tame her inner excitement as everything in her wanted to run.   
  
While she set one foot in front of the other, cautious to make as little noise as possible, the small girl � whose name by the way was Ginger - wondered for a second if she wasn't acting a bit too childish: Surely it was the 25th of December, the day of Christmas when her presents would lie under the tree. But was it really okay for a sixteen-year old girl to behave like she was six, even if she looked like it due to some rare genetical disorder? Shouldn't she have slipped out of her light pink nightdress into some casual clothes first, or at least put a pair of socks over her naked feet? Then again, she thought, it was Christmas, and although she knew her greatest wish wouldn't be granted � she had given up on that a long time ago - some fancy clothes and a new mobile phone weren't too bad either.   
  
Unable to contain herself anymore the small girl raced towards the stairway, rushing it down. With a huge leap she took the last five steps at once, nearly falling as she landed on the floor. Once she caught herself again she immediately continued running, taking the corner to the living room with hasty steps.  
  
Standing in the doorway Ginger stopped, her body frozen in awe. Though the lights were not switched on yet, the tall tree was already shining brightly from its numerous decorations: Christmas balls gleaming in various colours, golden and silver tinsel wind around the needles, wooden and metal bells swaying silently in the room, little Santa Clauses riding sleights or carrying present bags, and a seemingly infinite amount of other ornaments hung from the tree, its branches buckling from the heavy weight. This in combination with its sheer size deeply impressed the small girl, the golden star on top of it almost out of her sight. Once she lowered her stare though Ginger grew even more excited, her large eyes almost shining from joy: Below the deepest branches the space between tree and ground was cramped with presents, each tied with a golden bow. In less then a second she was kneeling down next to the colourful boxes, looking all over them. Some were not bigger than a mouse, while others almost outbid her in size(though this wasn't too hard). Seeing through the sheer mass she was about to grab the nearest one, when she spotted something in the corners of her eyes.  
A bit off from the tree a single present was lying on the floor, wrapped in grey paper. There was no bow tied around it, and it looked like it had been carried over a long distance. Being an outsider compared to the others this package caught Ginger's interest. Not wanting to stand up she crawled over to it, dragging her legs over the floor. Quite curious she grabbed the present with her tiny hands, but then instantly frowned: it felt all cold and wet.   
  
This present really puzzled Ginger's mind. Had her parents bought it last minute, with no time to pack it like the rest? That was the most plausible explanation, though she had no clue what could be inside it. She didn't make any special wishes this year, or at least nothing worth to rush into the store at the day before Christmas. Or did her parents come up with something themselves?  
  
Carefully Ginger unwrapped the plainly packaged present, behaving a bit more appropriate for her age. Once the paper was off it revealed a usual brown box beneath, looking a little damaged. For a while she just stared at it in wonder, unsure what to do � it was a little suspicious, after all. In the end however curiosity led her to open it, the small girl eagerly peeking into the inside.  
  
It was empty.  
  
"Is that some prank?", she asked, seemingly not amused. Going back into little girl mode she tossed the box aside, reaching her arms out to grab another one. In the middle of the motion however she suddenly stopped, her gaze focused on her hands.   
  
For a second, it had felt like they were� growing?  
  
Quickly Ginger shook her head. Impossible! Absolutely ridiculous! Yet, as she looked at her fingers, it did seem they were a bit longer� no, she thought, no! This was absurd! She had always wished to finally grow up, to stand equal with her friends, to finally not be a freak anymore - but that was a wish that couldn't be granted. As hard as her life was, a sixteen-year old girl could not believe in such things as magic or miracles, and definitely in no San�  
  
Her thoughts were cut off as her fingers visibly grew an inch.  
  
Wide-eyed and with an open mouth Ginger suddenly felt a tingle everywhere in her body. Turning stiff from the shock she was unable to move as a rising pressure was building up inside of her. Helplessly the small girl watched her childish hands becoming more filigree, rising in size while staying unmeagerly slim. Her arms were also growing longer, getting slightly thicker along the line - luckily, her dress had no sleeves. In a similar process her legs were maturing as well, making her miniature feet grow to a size that would leave footprints in the snow(a joke from some meanies at school: They said she was so small, her feet wouldn't even leave prints in the snow). Her skirt, lying mainly between her lower legs and the floor, was pulled up by her growing body, slowly revealing the youngster's chocolate-coloured skin. Her formerly loose dress seemed to be shrinking as the fabric tightened around her torso, the small teenager steadily going up in height. As she progressed in age the outlook of her face altered appropriately, changing from chubby-faced child with sweetly large eyes towards pretty adolescent in a few moments. Her black hair also extended slightly to fit the new size of her head, straining the red ribbons on each curl.  
  
Going through years in seconds the first signs of puberty started to hit Ginger: While her face luckily remained unaffected by pickles or other deformations, the rest of her body began to curve out slightly, giving her a much more feminine figure. Reaching backwards Ginger's small bum started to develop, pressing against her skirt � fortunately, she wore no underwear. As her butt was rounding out, achieving a quite appealing outline, her legs also grew more defined, the expansion focusing on her thighs. At the same time, Ginger felt a strong pressure rising in the top region of her dress, a small bump coming out from her previously plain torso.   
  
Overwhelmed by the growth Ginger let out a shriek, watching her chest reach out at a relatively fast pace. The gap on front of her dress quickly widened, while the threats that held it together began to stretch. Two small mounds then forcefully pressed themselves into that gap, creating a minor valley of flesh.   
  
Though her entire body was growing Ginger became strangely sensitive to the expansion of her bosom, feeling every ounce it packed on. She only vaguely noticed her dress had risen above her knees, bit by bit uncovering her exotically dark body. Her butt was only slightly growing in size, but still shaped up together with her hips, gaining a form some of her classmates would be envious of. In contrast to all the growth her waist had remained relatively slim, though none of her bones was shining through the over-stretched fabric of her dress. Continuously growing taller her body stood somewhere in the early teen years, getting gradually closer to the that of an ordinary 16-year old.   
  
However, it seemed certain parts of Ginger would not be satisfied with being ordinary.  
  
At an alarming rate her breasts were expanding, their speed overshadowing any other growth she underwent. Reaching the measurements of small fruits their basements began to press against each other, her meat balls steadily curving towards perfect spheres. While the squeeze in her cleavage increased by the second, triggering a tingling prickle on the contact, a slight pain arose in Ginger's back, accompanied by a dragging in her shoulders. The young girl groaned, wishing for some kind of support. Instead, the little help her dress gave constantly diminished as it slowly dissolved under the influence of her aging body, its already pale colour brightening further. Though the fabric showed no signs of ripping yet the growth was tearing her V-neck ridiculously large, giving a generous insight to the finest parts of Ginger in all their firm glory.   
  
Pressing against each other her grapefruit-sized globes started to flare over her figure, standing slightly beyond her waist. That wasn't too hard though since it had not much changed from the beginning, its slim appeal underlined by her form-fitting clothing. All parts of Ginger's body had at least doubled in size, gaining some quite attractive attributes along the line: Her once tiny hands had turned delicately feminine, looking like she had never worked in her entire life. The end of her dress was steadily approaching her heart-shaped bubble butt, the curvy youngster sporting a quite voluminous backside. The smooth appeal of her long legs was also gorgeous, even as she sat on her knees, the most notable feature of course her compact thighs in their shining stoutness (though her feet were also cute to look at). All chubby charm had vanished from her expression, remaining soft enough not to give her a stern look, her face all in all quite pretty. Her hair was as curly as before, though most of her ribbons had fallen off in the process, making it seem a little messy.  
  
While most of her body appeared confident with its appearance, starting to slow down in its growth, Ginger's breasts still seemed displeased about their current state: Blooming to CD-size they continued to swell outwards, pressing against each other and her clothes. One by one the strings of her V-neck broke apart, every breakthrough sending her bust further forward. The small impacts strengthened the tingle between her breasts, Ginger's lips quivering as she tried to stay calm. Shaking at the unknown sensation the youngster let out a slight moan, shallow as a whisper, while her breasts went up towards larger scales. Though her nightdress did an impressive job at holding out, considering it was designed for someone of half her size, the rift on her front was steadily growing deeper, going down the roundings of her incredible firm bosom. The light colour of her dress stood in great contrast to her dark skin, emphasising how much of her body was revealed: With all strings broken and a clean rift at the front a good third of her chest stood at disposal, while her arms and legs were basically free from cover. Having already much to share her breasts still grew larger, together already overdoing her head. Round and full they stood proudly from her chest, perfectly matching the rest of her curvaceous figure.   
  
Sporting an exceptionally attractive body Ginger eventually felt the growth fade off, only doing a few last corrections on her: a little bit volume here, some more bulk there, another fallen ribbon, and just as fast as everything had begun it ended, leaving the youngster with a figure just beyond the average teenager's, and a bust just beyond the average adult's.   
  
Not daring to move Ginger sat paralyzed, watching her bosom go up and down from her heavy breathing. Her skirt had risen up to her butt's end, so one could freely glance at her smooth legs, most eyes probably getting stuck at her sturdy, but not unnaturally thick thighs. In her kneeling position she slightly stuck out her prominent butt, unintentionally increasing it's firm, round appeal. Clinging tightly to her skin Ginger's nightdress greatly emphasised her decent hourglass-figure, going from a cute bubble butt with honey-sweet hips over a softly curved waist up to a more than healthy bustline. Though her breasts were stout as rubber each move she made created a little wobbling, the resulting friction tickling the sensitive girl. A bit nervous Ginger took a look around, feeling rather uncomfortable in her new body. Even on her knees, the ground seemed so far away� Spotting the box she had opened before she began to ask herself if this all wasn't just a weird dream � it wouldn't have been the first time, after all.   
  
Still staring at the open present box she suddenly noticed a folded piece of paper inside it. "Was that there the whole time?", she wondered, bending over to it. Feeling her breasts hanging down and her skirt rising up a slight blush formed on Ginger's face, the freshly baked grown-up quickly grabbing the paper before jolting back to her original position.  
  
*RIP*  
  
The fast maneuver had been too much for her strained dress: On its backside, a deep tear now almost went down her entire back, ending just above her butt, while the display of wiggling cleavage on her front had extended to the end of her bust. Her face turned even darker from the blood that flew into it, Ginger focusing on the letter as she tried to ignore her nightdress had just turned into a very revealing evening dress.  
  
*My dear Ginger,  
  
I know it has been a very hard time for you up to this point, and to my shame, I have to admit some of the lacking joys in your life are my fault. Due to an unacceptable error in our database � we had just installed our workshop with computers that year � your name has been put on the naughty children's list for seven years without any reason. In the name of the entire company I personally want to apologize for all the missing presents of that time. Normally, only wishes concerning toys are accepted by us, and only for those below thirteen. But for your special case, we decided to make an exception with the rules. Also, as an attempt to compensate for all your hardships, a little extra was added onto your wish: I know you always wanted to look just like "any kid your age", but I think being a bit off from the average won't be to your disliking ;)  
  
I again apologize for our mistakes and wish you a merry Christmas!  
  
Sincerely, your Santa Clause. Hohoho!  
  
P.S.: I actually don't laugh like this in private, but due to licensing contracts I have to use it as my trademark laughter.*  
  
Ginger read the letter once more, very slowly, then quietly put it down. Was it a bad joke from someone at school? A dream? Or could it really�?   
  
Again Ginger looked down, staring right into the depths of her new body. A bit hesitant, she put her hands on her legs, getting in touch with her firm body. Moving her arms upwards she then let her fingers slide over every curve of her body, from the full meat of her thighs over the ample roundings of her butt, following the soft conjunction between hip and waist while running over the tight fabric of her dress, until finally approaching her bounteous meat buns. They were so large, like small melons, Ginger unable to reach even half around them. Yet the soft flesh slightly gave in as she put her hands on their sides, squishing her plunging neckline a little. Everything felt so real: the jiggling, the sensitivity, her new height - still, she just couldn't bring herself to believe this all�   
  
Her hands were still resting on her bosom, slightly tickling the sensitive area. Again she began to move her arms up and down, just so softly her breasts wouldn't move(or at least not much). The fond treatment caused the young woman to distress a little, easing the stiffness in her muscles. Stroking herself Ginger slowly sat up, cautious not to damage her dress further. After some effort she was back on her bare feet, though she had to stand ducked due to the weight of her chest. Trying to straighten up she fought with her balance, almost falling down multiple times. Her breasts jiggled every time she shifted her body, Ginger strengthening her grip on them to halter their movements a little.   
  
Finally she rose up to full height, still holding her wobbling bust in both hands. Though she felt very insecure on her legs, shaking from time to time, the black bombshell was amazed by how tiny the world suddenly seemed: Sure, she was no giant, her height probably the only thing that was completely average about her. But compared from a moment ago everything in the living room now seemed so tiny: The couch, the TV, the chimney - even the once towering Christmas tree now seemed less imposing. Mindlessly Ginger inhaled her environment, appearing like a little girl again that saw the world for the first time.   
  
While she looked around in astonishment, her ears suddenly caught footsteps from the stairs. The well-developed teenager turned towards the door, a big smile on her face. "Let's see how my parents will like my "special" present", she chuckled, squeezing her soft spheres as a pair of adults entered the room, stopping dumb-founded at the door...

Missed this before, but am happy to have found it now, even out of season. As a creative way to find a rationale for BE, it works beautifully, and you make your heroine/recipient sound quite attractive, even in her small sin (Who hasn't at least wanted to open a Christmas present early?) Now all we have to do is find a way for us males to enjoy the presence of the ladies so enhanced.

[:iconfaestock:](http://faestock.deviantart.com/) `[faestock](http://faestock.deviantart.com/) is one of our best known and popular deviants from the Stock and Resources community. Her gallery is filled to the brim with high quality stock photographs that have inspired deviants to get creative, and turn the already beautiful images into something magical. Jessica always takes time to reach out to deviants, providing contests and nurturing other artists. We're inspired by her selfless attitude and dedication to a genre that we couldn't create without. It's with great pleasure that we award the Deviousness Award for September 2013 to `[faestock](http://faestock.deviantart.com/), congratulations.  [Read More](http://today.deviantart.com/)

**Milk for a Maiden**"Man, what an old-fashioned uniform!", May sighed, glancing at her black house-maiden dress and white apron. In her long, curly hair, she wore a white maiden cap, while black high-heels and white socks covered her feet. "Well, at least the skirt is short." Cleaning the kitchen table, the brunette then saw a bottle of milk. "Hey, milk!", she said, grabbing the bottle. "If my new boss pays me so lousy, he can't complain if I drink some of his milk." Opening it, she emptied the bottle with a few gulps, ignoring the warning label "FROM GENETICALLY MODIFIED COWS � MAY CAUSE SWELLINGS ON SOME PERSONS".  
  
Just as she put the bottle down again, M](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Milk-for-a-Maiden-166103544)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**In retrospect...**Sarah stared into her glass, blushing slightly. With the straw she drew circles on the surface of her juice, nervously shifting around on her chair. �Sooo, how do you feel?", she asked, not looking up from her glass.  
  
�Like a milk-cow", the woman next to her said. Around them, Sarah could hear the whispers of the other guests at the street caf�, constantly glaring over to their table. People passing on the street gazed towards them, their eyes nearly popping out of their heads. �You know, one of those genetically modified with the fat udders."  
  
Silently, Sarah took a sip from her orange juice � coincidentally, &#](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/In-retrospect-202581465)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Bikini Body**"Okay, I've added the cat-ears. Now, do you think I'd look better with a bunny nose or a bird beak?" The 22-year old college girl shifted a little on her couch so she could hold her pencil better, while making a few alterations on the semi-anthropomorphic sketch of herself. Between her right shoulder and ear she was holding a telephone from which she impatiently awaited a reply. Meanwhile, the other occupant of the couch looked up at her with a similarly impatient look in her eyes. "I swear I've already fed you twice today, Mitty", she told her begging pet.  All the black cat responded was "meow" before getting up and jumping off th](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Bikini-Body-251846519)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**The genie from the milk bottle**There weren't many people who could open a door with their feet, but Amanda was one of them.  
  
Holding the key between her toes the young woman put it into the keyhole, bending a little backwards. She had to be careful nothing would fall out of the box she was carrying in her arms. �That was a good day", she said to herself, looking at all the plastic items, cans and other garbage she had collected. �I can make a lot out of this stuff!"  
  
With little effort she tilted the key around, opening the door. Her apartment looked like one would expect it from a 24-year old woman, maybe a bit larger than the average. The greatest difference be](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/The-genie-from-the-milk-bottle-196457100)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**A Hardware Upgrade**Since she was a child Jean had always loved flying. Though it was over twenty years ago she could still remember the first time when she had entered a plane. She was so nervous she had hold tightly to the arm of her mother the entire time on the airport, and once they sat inside immediately grabbed the leans of her seat. When the plane took off she almost screamed, and couldn't calm down until the signs for the seatbelts had gone off. But as she dared a look outside the window after a while and stared at the sea of white fluffy clouds and the beautiful landscape beneath the plane all her fear was immediately replaced with utter awe.

**Phone Call BE**"I can't believe this guy!"  
  
Amanda shut the door behind her, all small objects in her apartment shaking at the impact. "How he can turn down me, Amanda Manor, the probably hottest girl in entire high school!? I prepared so hard for this: I made my hair for two hours, tanned my skin in the solar studio and put on the smallest, tightest jeans skirt I could fit in!" Putting her hands into her tank-top she pulled two bundles of cotton out of her bra, reducing her cup-size to a modest B. "I even stuffed my bra more than usually", she sighed. "Now how shall I get a date until Friday?"  
  
After throwing the cotton away she grabbed her telephone, push](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Phone-Call-BE-187436187)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Snow Boobs**It was a late afternoon in December when a young woman was taking a walk through the park. Flakes danced around her nose as she walked over the snow-clad path, smiling at the white scenery around her. The branches of the trees were buckling under the weight of the snow, while the usually lush and green lawn was hidden beneath an at least two inch deep layer of snow. The path the woman was walking on wasn't quite as snowed, but her large winter boots still left deep imprints behind her. While it wasn't pitch-black the lanterns on each side of the path were already shining, their light reflecting in the surrounding snow, and with each minute th](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Snow-Boobs-275240349)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**A Witchy Accident**"Lalala-lala~♪"  
  
The lovely voice of a young lady echoed through the bathroom, filling it with a cheerful melody. Inside a full bathtub the source of the music, a young woman in her early twenties was taking a bath, chirping this little tune while she thoroughly rubbed some foam over her leg. The water pearled off her skin as she stretched her leg into the air, reflecting the light of the ceiling lamp and the full moon that was shining through the window. "Ah, there's nothing like a hot bath", the woman sighed. The tips of her purple hair sunk into the water as she put her head back a little and glided a little deeper into the bathtub.](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/A-Witchy-Accident-272934324) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Tale of the sexy ninja girl**It was a dark night somewhere in the ancient Japan. Carefully, Ayumi peeked out of the small bush she had chosen as her hideout. A few hundred feet ahead of her was the castle she had to infiltrate, the only way inside being a well guarded gate. The young ninja quickly crawled out of the bush, sneaking towards a nearby tree. Before she could hide behind it though she accidentally tripped over one of its roots, and fell onto her face. Cursing at the moonless night she hastily checked if the guards had heard her. Once she was sure nobody had taken notice of her presence Ayumi covered behind the tree, while taking an old paper scroll from her we](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Tale-of-the-sexy-ninja-girl-204211313)

Kristy was relieved and thankful that someone had finally accepted her job application. Being fresh out of school she had barely any experience in anything but skipping school.

So, with a great deal of effort Mona sat up, and eventually she made her way out of the bedroom and into the bathroom.  
When she had started her new job, Mona possessed a natural C-cup bust: nothing to brag about, but then again nothing to be scoffed at either.

Jenny was in the kitchen of her apartment preparing dinner. Ever since she had graduated high school, she finally started to feel more responsibilities as life came towards her. Although she was only nineteen tears old, she had a pretty decent job that paid good money. Living in an apartment was okay for her as she didn't have to pay a whole lot of money besides the rent and other necessities.  
  
She was always a smart girl, always above average in her classes back in high school. She had long brown hair, and had a great smile. Her cheeks had just a touch of red; almost as if she were blushing, and she had sexy lips](http://blueberryjanelle.deviantart.com/art/Jenny-s-Busty-Surprise-170338964) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Lisa and Mona - Chapter 2**Lisa watched over the course of a few weeks as Mona tried her best to control her lactation. It was a marvelous thing to watch as Mona's breasts swelled and shrank, the tide of milk ebbing and flowing in regular cycles. Every two days Mona's breasts would swell from a D-cup to and E-cup, filling up with milk until they could take no more, then spectacularly releasing it in one long gush. Mona had learned from her experience on the subway to avoid public places when she knew her nipples were about to release the flood, but it was hard to manage. She still had to work during the day, and there was always the possibility of a surprise leak.

Katrina's eyes looked up at Kylie, "What's that supposed to mean."  
  
"Well, both you and Clara do that. Just teleport to places randomly."

Subject April XXX applied through the university e-mail system today. I'm not sure who was the wise-ass who felt it necessary to assign the meet-up on Valentine's Day, but he's probably enjoying the joke more than anyone else. At least it's fitting; the subject felt it pleasing to show up then. She mentioned wanting to be particularly impressive today; a date, perhaps?

Clara nodded and walked off into the kitchen. Kylie walked to the Potion Room where she found Katrina muttering to herself as she poured liquid into a big round cauldron that was in the center of the room.  
  
Katrina grabbed a bottle off the shelf and walked up to the cauldron. She looked at the bottle in her hand, and thought to herself for a moment.

On that day, it was about noon and they had both planned to meet for lunch at a local restaurant.

**More Milk for More Maidens**"Aren't you done changing yet, April?", Victoria yelled from the kitchen. As her younger co-worker didn't reply she sighed. "Man, first day in our first job, and she can't even get into her uniform."

 "Aren't you done changing yet, April?", Victoria yelled from the kitchen. As her younger co-worker didn't reply she sighed. "Man, first day in our first job, and she can't even get into her uniform." Lowering her green eyes the tall girl looked at the clothes she wore: A short black dress alongside a white apron and matching boots. There was also a white maiden's cap tucked into her short crimson hair. "The chief maiden will be here any moment", she mumbled. "Said something about a "special test" on the phone. And that butler just gave us our uniforms and told us to go straight into the kitchen once we have changed � the rich surely are weird!"   
  
On the kitchen counter, she then noticed two glasses of milk, alongside a note: *For the newbies from the veteran♥* "Sweet!", Victoria squeaked in delight, smiling as she emptied  one of the glasses in a few gulps. Once she placed it on the table again she began to feel a bit strange � not sick or bad, just strange. Leaning against the table Victoria noticed a tingle in her chest, slowly engulfing her little breasts. When she took a look down herself she saw a small bump forming in her apron, steadily rising from her body. The bump slowly divided itself into two rounding bulges, Victoria's eyes widening as she watched her breasts growing right in front of her.   
  
Clenching the edge of the table Victoria threw her head into her neck. A warm shiver was running from her breasts through the entire rest of her body, the 20-year-old  closing her eyes at the sensation. With every ounce her body gained she felt a stronger drag in her shoulders, increased by the rising pressure inside her clothes. Curving towards full spheres her small domes pulled on the fabric of her maiden uniform, taking the little space left inside it. Beneath her apron her black dress was growing painfully tight, struggling to keep her blowing bust contained. The bulges in her fabric gradually approached each other, smoothing the wrinkles of her apron. Her athletic figure had already curved out noticeably, her chest standing slightly off from her body. The tingle inside it was still growing, or at least it felt so to Victoria. The bigger her bosom became, the better she could feel what happened around it: the growth, the pressure of her clothes, the tingling of her skin � everything was getting clearer and more intense over time. Although she was a quite strong-willed person, Victoria had a hard time keeping a cool head. Through her apron two peaks showed her inner struggle, while a slight blush formed on the maiden's face.   
  
As she was fighting with herself her breasts grew another inch forward, tearing at the stability of her dress. With a power Victoria wouldn't have expected from it her maiden uniform withstood the swelling bustline, holding it back. Despite the slight deformation this caused her breasts still remained a round appeal to them, underlined by the smooth fabric lying on them. Standing proudly off from Victoria her bosom began to flare over her body, gently brushing her arms. Unconsciously, Victoria twitched her fingers, gulping down a moan as the young woman suppressed the rising urge to grope herself.  
  
As the sensitivity of her breasts increased Victoria began to pant � it was getting hard for her to concentrate. Still, in worry of herself, she managed to peek at her growing bust: Where she would usually see a flat board a pair of firm curves now greeted Victoria, the tall woman looking like she had put small coconuts into her uniform. Memories of a time when she had put oranges into her top called back into her mind � only this time, her fruits were not made out of fruit flesh, but flesh flesh.  
  
Pulling herself together Victoria loosened herself from the kitchen table. This was ridiculous: After several tough years in high school she had finally come to accept her body, and now she was growing from some random milk?! Shaking her head at this absurdity Victoria ran out of the kitchen, looking for somebody who could help her. Each step shook her breasts a little, but as they were tucked firmly inside her clothes, they remained relatively calm. The larger they became however the more the shakes turned into bounces, sending a leaping pain through Victoria. With her growing bust she dashed through the old mansion, desperately searching for help. The growth was hard to spot as she ran, but *she* clearly felt every additional bit of bosom rub against her uniform. Strained from the strengthening jumps she could already hear the first seams of her dress ripping apart � considering it was made for someone with practically no chest, it was a miracle it had hold out that long.  
  
Getting more panicky (and busty) by the second Victoria rushed through the mansion. Behind each door however she only found a spacious, but deserted room. And everytime she stopped the momentum of her breasts was heavier, their diameter already surpassing that of CD's. During one of her stops then a loud rip could be heard from the top of her dress, the sound sending goosebumps over Victoria's back. At her collar, she could feel a small part of her bosom being uncovered, exposing a small amount of cleavage. Though it wasn't quite as compressed anymore her bulging bosom continued to tear on her dress, deepening her neckline � luckily, her white apron was lying relatively high, so the rift soon vanished underneath it. Since her growth showed no signs of stopping though Victoria knew it was only a matter of time until it would rip as well. Quickening her steps she kept running through the mansion, her meat buns jiggling in every direction as they grew out from her.   
  
Meanwhile, a woman roughly a head shorter than Victoria had entered the kitchen, wearing the same outfit as her. Her smooth amber hair swayed slightly as she turned her head from side to side, her hazel eyes searching for her roommate. "Um, Victoria?", April called into the room. Her voice was rather shy, and not very loud. Instead of her friend she spotted a glass of milk on the table. "Guess I should drink it", she said after reading the note. "It would be impolite to refuse a gift from our new employer."   
  
Quickly she drunk out the entire milk. After she had put the glass back on the table a tingle arose in her modest chest, making her feel a little uncomfortable. Under slight blushing April watched as her decent B-cups began to develop, enlarging the bump in her apron. The already snug bra she wore was slowly overflown by her breasts, while their rising sensitivity caused a stirring sensation inside the 18-year-old. Clearly one could hear the fabric of her black dress getting stretched, her body shivering slightly as the pressure inside her uniform steadily increased. Slowly, her upper curves reached out, straining her clothes. Every new pound her bust gained deepened the blush in April's face, until it was shining like a tomato. She wanted to run off like Victoria, but the pleasant feeling her growth caused took most of her self-control away. Her bra, already a cup-size too small for her, was hurting April, the white cups trying to push her breasts back into her body.   
  
Feeling restless April jumped up and down, flapping her arms through the air. Her bosom rubbed against her clothes, causing her arms to move faster. She gasped quietly when her sensitive orbs started to bump against each other, again and again, until they constantly touched one another. Her tight clothes forced her progressing bustline back, April's mind wavering at the upcoming sensations. With a loud snap the lock of her bra broke apart, jutting her breasts to the size of softballs. Free from underwear they wobbled forth and back from their outburst, moving like jello inside her uniform.  
  
Immediately April stopped hopping. Growing into full spheres her breasts pushed her broken bra off, letting it fall down to her waist. Though they were round and heavy they still stood firmly off from her body once the jiggling had subsided, their sagging at the absolute minimum of what their weight allowed. Like white silk her apron was lying perfectly smooth over her bosom, while her dress looked and felt several sizes too small around her chest. The tingling engulfed her entire body, growing stronger the tighter her clothes pressed on her milkjugs. On top of the bulging mounds two smaller bulges suddenly poked through her apron, only slightly noticeable, but still there. Overwhelmed April let out a moan, so shallow it probably couldn't be heard outside of the kitchen. In stuttering movements she rose her arms up towards her bosom, slowly opening her palms. Just before she could put her shaking hands around her breasts though April hesitated. The little distance was quickly closed though, the fabric of her apron brushing her fingers. As the soft spheres flowed into her hands April's eyes shot  wide open, but then quickly closed them again. The contact with her breasts brought her arousal to a new level, the small peaks on them thickening a little.   
  
Unable to hold herself back the shy girl grabbed her tits. The firm curves pressed softly against her palms, fitting perfectly into her cupped hands. Putting her head back April felt like her feet were lifted up from the ground. Another moan slipped through her lips, this time a little louder. As her breasts outgrew her palms she began to massage the mounting mass, gently, but determined. Each grope send a greater wave of pleasure through her body, her nipples growing from time to time. The little part of April's mind that still worked kept her from getting too wild, though occasionally it let a moan escape from her mouth, getting more frequent and louder over time. After some intense caressing April removed her hands from her body, and let her mounds swell out for a moment. Her breasts were around the size of large grapefruits, going for honeydews. Still not in full control of her actions she then slipped her hands beneath her apron. With only the thin cover of her dress the touch alone was enough to make her legs tremble. Pressing her buxom spheres together April opened her eyes. Her eyeballs then rolled up towards the ceiling as she felt a rising amount of body mass between her fingers, the teen thoroughly kneading her soft flesh. Each drive made her breath go a bit harder, her pleasure bursting out in a moan from time to time. One by one the seams of her dress gave in, the ripping accelerated by her rubbing hands. April barely heard as the first holes appeared in her uniform � some were covered by her apron, while those at the sides showed small excerpts of her light-coloured skin. Under the influence of her growing assets the rifts steadily extended, her dress bit by bit turning into Swiss cheese. April didn't care though as her mind was completely focused on the massage she gave her growing assets.     
  
Victoria in the meantime was still running through the strangely deserted house. The weight on her chest caused her to slow down a bit, and exhaustion was starting to hit her. More and more her breasts were dragging on her, going through the size of rockmelons. The rip in her dress had grown into a full V-neck, and though the tip was hidden beneath her apron it shined through the white fabric. She could feel the seams growing weaker with every bounce, her bosom pressing with full force against the apron. Knowing that it wouldn't hold on anyway she put her hands on the knot in her neck. Once it was open the apron was shot off her chest, hanging loosely at her waist. While she opened her belt Victoria took a quick look down herself. Without the apron her cleavage reached to the middle of her bosom, the meat balls inside wobbling and rubbing against each other. Though it was still ripping down a little her V-neck stayed relatively fixed due to the bulk of her chest increasing as well. The larger her bust grew the more her black dress emphasised each of its firm curves. Victoria didn't care though how sexy she looked right now, but only wished to finally stop growing and get back into clothes that fit her.      
  
While she threw her apron away Victoria suddenly heard a familiar voice coming from the kitchen. "April!", it shot through her mind. On the spot she turned around, the resulting swing of her bosom deepening her cleavage by an inch. Pumping all her strength into her legs she dashed through the house's numerous floors, her breasts almost jumping out of her dress. Their size was almost on par with her head, and by their current growth rate probably would have busted that border before she arrived in the kitchen. The load almost made Victoria trip, but in worry of her friend she kept pushing forward, sweating and panting in exhaustion.  
  
In the kitchen the situation hadn't changed much from before, much in contrary to April's body. Her black dress had mainly ripped apart, giving a generous insight to her bounteous breasts. The flesh was pressing through every of the numerous rifts in her dress, so her hands often moved over her bare bosom as she continued to fondle it. April moaned and panted, being short before a collapse, but she still wanted more. Without reserve she tore the remaining pieces of her dress apart. Now her breasts were only covered by her apron, and it wasn't a very good cover: On the sides her roundings were completely uncovered, while a rectangle-shaped cleavage stood between the holders. The harsh ripping caused her mounds to jiggle a bit, her large nipples rubbing against the fabric of the apron.   
  
Putting her hands back beneath her apron April continued to massage her growing mammaries, feeling their softness without any boundaries. The surging sensations forced her a little into the knees, her moaning echoing through the whole house. She was shaking from head to toe, while her body buckled slightly under the rising weight of her chest. Her nipples were so hard it hurt her, their outlines fully visible through her apron. Its holders pressed tightly into her skin, while wrinkles appeared on the previously plain fabric as her bosom formed boils inside her apron. No feelings of pain reached her mind though, the young maiden soundly focusing on what her hands were doing with her sensitive body.    
  
She was just about to drop herself on the ground when April finally got aware of what she was doing. "EEK!", she shrieked, quickly putting her hands off from her body. The sensations inside her didn't vanish, but at least were reduced a little. She could slowly feel them increase again however as her bosom was still growing. "I-I have to get out of here!", she screamed. With a red head she jumped towards the exit, her breasts bouncing wildly inside her tight apron.  
  
Just when she reached the door April bumped into Victoria's boobs.  
  
With her friend's head between her head-sized tits Victoria moaned, feeling April's breasts below her own. Being both taller and heavier than April she threw her on the ground, burying her face inside her cleavage as they landed on the floor. Quickly Victoria crawled backwards until her breasts lay on top of April's, the four milkjugs growing against each other. Both could feel the other's nipples in their soft flesh, hardening at the embarrassment of the situation. "S-s-sorry, Vicky", April stuttered. Her fragile frame sported a pair of massive F-cups, being only slightly smaller than Victoria's knockers. In her face Victoria could see April was even more exhausted than herself, and could guess what had happened inside the kitchen while she was gone.  
  
To ease the situation Victoria forced a smile into her face. "It's okay April", she assured her friend. "I'm just glad you aren't hurt." Their breasts continued to grow against each other's, arousing the two women even further. Their firm spheres were deformed a little as Victoria lay on top of April, squishing them with her weight. Her cleavage, which had stayed relatively in place up until now, continued to tear deeper, the extension of her V-neck causing more of her skin to rub against April's. The eighteen-year-old was still staying closely behind Victoria in cup-size, her breasts swelling out of her apron. The rectangle shaped cleavage was turning into a U-form, while increasingly more body mass flowed over the sides. After a while of lying beneath her friend, April shyly rose her voice: "Um, Vicky, you're a bit heavy�"     
  
"Oh, sorry." A little embarrassed Victoria tried to push herself off from her friend. Slowly, the two women's breasts regained their shape as she lifted her body up, the four spheres shining in all their magnitude. Victoria's had grown to a full pair of volleyballs, while April's had just surpassed her head. With trembling arms Victoria tried to stand up, her sweat falling into April's cleavage. In the end however she didn't find the strength to lift the extra weight she had gained, and her arms gave away. Falling back down her breasts crashed into April's, forcing a gasp out of her timid girl. "S-sorry", Victoria said again, her body going up and down. Under Victoria's boobs one could hear the fabric of April apron ripping, forming a narrow hole at the underside of her bosom.   
  
Quickly Victoria put her arms back on the ground, searching for a good spot to lift herself up again. While doing so however she accidentally touched one of April's breasts. Feeling a foreign hand on her body April shrieked, wildly wavering her arms through the air. Immediately Victoria opened her mouth to apologize. But instead she also shrieked when one of April's hands ended up on her bosom. April felt the pleasure in her rising again, and mindlessly twitched her fingers around Victoria's bust. Now it was time for the red-haired maiden to let out a moan, while at the same time she reflexively groped her friend as well. Soon both women were massaging the other's growing chest with one hand, gasping and moaning at every grope. Infinite waves of pleasures ran through the women's growing curves. Almost simultaneously they put their second hand on the other's bosom as well, feeding their urges by groping one another. While the house almost vibrated under their moans their breasts continued to dock onto one another's with growing force, their cleavages looking like they were about to fuse. The hole in April's apron continued to expand, showing a diamond-shaped area of undercleavage, while Victoria's dress almost ripped down to the end of her bosom.   
  
Their breasts wobbled and shook in their light covers, Victoria slowly drifting to the side from the quakes. Eventually she fell off from April's body, which allowing their curves to shine in their full size. Still feeling aroused Victoria quickly turned her face and basketball buns to April, who did the same with her pumpkin puppies. Without the pressure of gravity their breasts were only slightly deformed as the women faced each other, both leaning up with an arm so they wouldn't drag their bosoms over the floor. For a brief moment, April and Victoria looked into each other's face. Driven by their urges both girls suddenly put their hands underneath the other one's clothes: Victoria through the sides of April's apron, and April into the cleavage of Victoria's dress. They could feel the flesh of the other swell inside their hands, not minding as one of their arms was pressed between bosom and ground. Victoria then closed her eyes as her friend began to fondle her breasts, and then lured a moan out of April when she did the same with hers. Knotting their legs together the two burst out into ecstatic screaming and rubbing, their busts growing against each other's into ever larger dimensions.  
  
While the two maidens went wild on the floor another woman entered the kitchen. She had brown hair with long curls, a pair of deep blue eyes, and was also wearing a maiden's uniform. In height, age and (original) proportions she stood between April and Victoria, who she watched in amusement as they lay on the ground. "Oh good, I see you possess the necessary requirements for this job!", she laughed. Watching their busts grow May quickly ran to the refrigerator. She picked a milk bottle with the label "WARNING: FROM GENETICALLY MODIFIED COWS - MAY CAUSE SWELLINGS ON SOME PERSONS" and took a generous sip from it.    
  
Seconds later and she could feel a rising pressure inside her uniform, her chest tingling in delight. With a broad smile she put a hand on her bosom, giggling a little as it was filled with breast flesh. Her slight bumps grew into full domes, their basements approaching each other in a quick pace. Though she wasn't that sensitive yet May closed her eyes, carefully massaging one of her tiny mounds. The term "tiny" however soon didn't fit anymore, May's mouth growing dry as her breasts grew into small citrus fruits, leading her to fasten her grip.  
  
April and Victoria meanwhile had not noticed the chief maiden's arrival, being occupied themselves. Since May had entered the kitchen Victoria had gotten close to a medicine ball rack, the rift in her dress going almost down her entire bust. Her black dress was pushed over her curving bosom, showing off a generous amount of skin. Ironically, it seemed to be held in place by her hard and large nipples. The feeling of April's hand send a constant shiver through Victoria, who was licking her lips between moans. Her friend's breasts were always following short after hers, swelling ever more through her apron. A small rip began to tear down at its top, turning her U-neck into a V-neck, while the hole on its downside steadily extended. Slowly the rift was reaching the end of her bosom, showing a small excerpt of her torso. At the same time the fabric also ripped upwards, displaying an enlarging amount of firm cleavage.   
  
Still fondling each other they didn't even notice May she began to mound softly. Holding the bottle with one hand she cupped her curving assets with the other one. For a brief second, she could could embrace her entire breast, her fingertips touching the basements of her chest. Slowly then they were lifted up by her blowing bosom, sending prickling impulses through her body as she pushed her fingers into the fabric of her uniform. May leaned her back against the refrigerator, shivering a little as her hot body pressed against the cold door. Putting her hand away she took a look at her rack: Her apron had been lifted off a little, leaving the sides of her grapefruit-sized mammaries only covered by the smooth fabric of her black dress. Without the dress a small amount of cleavage would also have looked out above her apron, but May decided not to rip her dress apart like April. Not this time.   
  
On the ground, things still had not calmed down: Though Victoria's growth had started to slow down, April was still swelling rather fast, steadily catching up to her friend. Her massive basketballs were pushed back by her apron, throwing wrinkles as they spilled over it. With a loud snap the belt at her belly suddenly broke apart, leading her breasts to bounce up and rub against Victoria's. Under the jiggles the white fabric of her apron evened around her bosom again, lying a little more loose on her body now. The hole on the bottom had slid up a bit, now showing cleavage at the center of her chest(if the sight hadn't been covered by Victoria's body). The red-haired girl had felt the bounce with her hands and breasts, watching as her friend overtook her in cup-size � after all, she had had started with a bit more than her, so it was only logical. April's growth then also slowed down, and the two of them gave their fondling a rest. Removing their hands from each other's bosom they silently waited for the end of their growth, panting in exhaustion.  
  
Quietly May looked at the two woman's busts, and then at her own. Knowing that she probably wouldn't catch up with her new subordinates any time soon May took another sip from the milk bottle. Her breasts responded with a greater tingle, which send a chill over May's spine. A little faster they continued to curve towards round spheres, slightly falling off as their peaks stood several inches off from her body. Her clothes groaned at the pressure, so she pulled them down a little. This resulted in a fine amount of cleavage, quickly deepening under her rising bustline. It didn't take long until her breasts surpassed game balls, now swelling through the data medium area.  
  
More and more flesh pressed out of her clothes, forming a swollen cleavage. Though they started to hang a little, the firmness of her breasts didn't suffer under their weight. Her back and shoulders, which had already endured numerous growths, didn't hurt or drag, even though she didn't wear a bra, so May could fully enjoy the feeling her growing mounds granted her. As her breasts lifted the fabric up from her body she pressed it into the gap between her boobs and torso, ensuring her clothes would underline the roundness of her assets. And since her hand was back at her bosom anyway she decided to squeeze it some more, the sounds of pleasure soon leaving her lips again.   
  
With her proud bustline extending beyond her shoulders May now approached melon scales. Her clothes slid lower and lower, the depth of her cleavage going through the length of her fingers. The collar of her dress arched slightly, turning into a quite revealing V-neck. Flesh poured out of her cleavage as it tried to squeeze itself out of her narrow clothes, while her massage caused the fabric to move a bit on her left breast. Feeling sexier by the second she pulled her uniform even lower, revealing a wide open-hearted excerpt of her bosom. When her breasts slowly came into range of her head she removed her back from the refrigerator. Taking a few steps forward she walked around the two women on the floor, gleefully enjoying every of her bounces as she examined the two. Their expansion was practically over, leaving them with breasts around the diameter of hubcaps. The difference in size was only vaguely visible, and May thought it was mainly because Victoria's dress was tighter than April's apron. Both pieces of clothing provided only an insufficient job of covering their bodies though: May could easily gaze down at Victoria's boobs from her shoulders to her waist, the fabric just barely gracing her areola. April's cleavage was around a third smaller, but her apron left a nice display of the sides of her bosom, and she also had the breast-filled hole at its center. Despite the apron lying loose on her body it was still pressing slightly into her skin, showing off every alluring curve the teen possessed, while Victoria's tight black dress gave her a slinky, somewhat seductive look.    
  
At their feet May stopped. Beneath their skirts she could see April was wearing a pair of white panties that covered her whole butt, while Victoria's were black and a little more revealing. After staring at their underwear a little more she put her gaze back on the most noticeable parts of their bodies. Their bosoms were roughly twice as big as her own, looking like soft, meaty pillows. "Boob bomb!", May suddenly shouted, jumping on her subordinates. The two women gasped at the sudden crash, their breasts wobbling and jiggling furiously as May landed on top of them. The chief maiden used this opportunity to pour some milk into their mouths, which they mindlessly gulped down. With a chuckle May then drunk the rest of the milk herself, and threw the empty bottle away. Lying on top of two massive busts May felt as her growth picked up again, while at the same time she was lifted up by the rising bosoms beneath her.  
  
With her growth speeding up again Victoria felt the seams of her dress reaching their limit: On her right side a loud rip proclaimed the first lose of her dress, revealing a small amount of her skin. Going from hubcaps to car tires her breasts squeezed with greater force against the others', May's increasing load smothering her outstanding curves. As her cleavage pressed ever higher Victoria put her head back as far as possible, while at the same time she tried to keep her mouth shut. Another rip on the other side of the bosom and she could feel the ground on most of her left breast, the hole steadily growing alongside her bust. The cool ceramic finally managed to break Victoria's composure, the young woman moaning wildly as she pushed her arm through the right hole of her dress. More and more rips could be heard as she fondled her soft bosom, each new tear causing her bust to slightly bulk up. Her dress was soon littered with rips and tears, some of them larger than her head, her growing breasts trying to escape through every hole.   
  
April meanwhile had not been so reluctant: Once her breasts were pushing stronger against the floor again she had already her hands back on them, ploughing with rising force through her soft flesh like a farmer through his field. The hole in her apron steadily grew, extending towards her cleavage and the bare sides of her bosom. Her cover grew smaller and smaller, getting surrounded by flesh from all sides. With a loud sound her apron finally ripped apart in the middle, causing her bust to jut a few inches forward. Her double-cleavage united into one giant canyon, her bosom now mainly covered by the holders of her apron. As her breasts continued to grow into beach balls April soon couldn't feel the bodies of the other maidens anymore, rubbing herself with such ferocity that she became numb to any other feeling. Her excessive fondling accidentally caused one of the holders to break, though April could neither feel nor hear it in her lustful screaming. The waves of flesh created from the outburst sent an impact through the other women's busts, her apron now only held by the pressure of Victoria's tits. With her mind almost broken April pedaled her legs through the air. Her hands were still on her bosom, but she was too aroused to even grope herself. Spit dripped from her mouth as the sensations overtook her, April only vaguely feeling as her breasts continued to grow.    
  
May, still far away from the other maidens, quickly caught up after her third drink, each of her breasts developing right on top of theirs. From head-size she went through all kinds of sports balls, her clothes struggling to keep her swelling mammaries contained. The amount of displayed skin grew ever larger, her dress sliding down her roundings to reveal steadily more of their firm beauty. As her breasts flowed over the apron her cleavage steadily deepened, already large enough for her entire face to sink in. Instead of real moaning May began to pant heavily, louder and more lustful the larger she became. If her breasts had not laid on top of April's and Victoria's, one would have clearly seen her inner arousal on them. But so it added to the other women's arousal as May's nipples pressed into their skin. The chief maiden reached out her hands to grope herself, when a thought suddenly crossed her mind. A wicked smile on her panting face May put her hands on the bosoms beneath her. Firmly and thoroughly then she began to fondle her new subordinates, their screams and moans increasing her own pleasure.   
  
It was literally an elevating experience as the growing assets lifted May up. Standing between basket and medicine balls the first rips could be heard from her dress, and soon after from her apron. May could feel her bare skin press against the surface of her "meat pillows", her tongue hanging from her mouth. Her breasts began to push on her arms which were still busy on the other women's bosoms, while her skirt was rising up a little � not that it had been hard to peek at her frilly pink underwear before as she was lying on top of the other maidens. Conquering the bodies of her subordinates May's rack swelled bigger and bigger, diminishing the cover her uniform provided. Her black dress was already a patchwork like Victoria's, and her apron had certainly also seen better days already. May then felt herself jumping a bit higher as the whole downside of her dress broke off, greatly boosting May's chest and creating a vast undercleavage. Her skirt slid down again, her breasts at the same time reaching the measurements the girls had when she had jumped down on them.  
  
Victoria and April meanwhile, agitated by their superiors fondling, were both moving their arms and legs through the air, their busts still in full development. Both were practically top-naked with Victoria's dress being full of tears, and April's ripped-up apron getting pushed into her cleavage. They were feeling aroused and helpless at the same time as the weight of May's breasts increased by the second. With another loud rip the knot of the chief maiden's apron broke apart, making her breasts press stronger into theirs. The loose apron fell between her subordinates, the holders tickling them a little as they brushed over their bosoms. But instead of chuckling the two roommates groaned as the weight on them got even heavier, straining their nerves in multiple ways.  
  
Rising ever higher May had to support herself with her legs so she wouldn't fall off. One after another the rips in her dress united, forming an ever growing alliance against the black fabric. A cleavage couldn't be really distinguished as her breasts poked out everywhere, squeezing so tightly against each other her smooth skin was throwing wrinkles. The small folds of flesh however quickly evened again as her dress steadily gave away, a giant hole already uncovering most of her left breast. With a sound bounce her right one then also blew off most of the fabric that covered it, throwing the broken pieces in April's face. Break after break her bosom freed itself from the uniform, every burst sending May another letter up the cup-bar. The front, sides, everything of her mammoth bust stood at full display, the massive mammaries pushing May's arms off from the other maidens. Spreading over their bosoms May's breasts swelled beyond beach ball size, almost on par with Victoria and April.  
  
Since she couldn't reach the other maidens anymore May began to massage her own tits. Kneading her soft meat buns she was now as busty as the women below her, her growth showing no signs of stopping. Her body straightened up until May was back on both feet, bending herself over April and Victoria. Though she standing at their legs her feet had quite some room as their bosoms created a gap between their bodies. A little playful May kicked April's bust, giggling at her audible reaction. With her breasts growing though she soon couldn't afford those pranks anymore, her rising upper-body forcing her on tiptoes. Despite their immense measurements the bare spheres were still round and firm, squishing the breasts beneath them into the ground.   
  
Feeling ever more chest on top of their own the two maidens eventually calmed down, their arousal decreasing. A shadow then casted itself over their faces, and when looking up they saw the dark edge of a large, round object. When their breasts had roughly the diameter of hula hoops they could feel their own growths slowing down, but the load on their bosoms was still increasing. The larger May grew the more their breasts were pressed into the ground, the massive weight almost cracking some of the ceramic tiles.   
  
The chief maiden was almost unable to stand on her feet anymore. While her frilly dressed butt rose ever higher to keep up with her upper-body she could feel herself slowly slipping off from her fairly round underground("fairly" because she was partly squishing it flat). May tried to reposition herself, but moving breasts the size of tractor wheels was no easy task. So she was a little bit relieved, but still mainly disappointed when she could feel her growth slowing down, leaving the maiden with no sight on the ground and a pair of boobs weighting more than some adult people.   
  
Widely grinning May looked over her gargantuan globes � or at least as far as she could. Her mountainous rack was smothering those of Victoria and April, the two girls groaning from time to time. Only an expert could have said who of the two new maidens was bigger, their breasts wobbling slightly under May's breathing. April, whose apron was completely lost inside her cleavage, buried her face into her breasts, trying to hide her embarrassment. Victoria, also only rudimentary covered by the remnants of her black dress, eventually was able to bring out a sentence: "Now I get why "expand your horizon" was underlined in that advert."  
  
"My idea", May giggled. Her bust shook and vibrated as she spoke, every move going directly to her underlings' bosoms. "I asked the boss if I could have some help, so he allowed me to set up an announcement." With a big grin May gave her breasts a keen slap, the waves of flesh forcing a gasp out of her subordinates.  "Okay, now that this is settled, let's get to business: I'm May, and I'll be your superior from now on. I look forward to be working with you! You can start by cleaning the bathrooms." Looking over the situation � or rather her bust � she added: "Um, once I've shrunken down enough to stand up from you, I mean."

This is a sequel to "Milk for a Maiden"([[link]](http://fav.me/d2qw6bc)), written to celebrate its 10k+ views ![:party:](./I3reacl_files/party2.gif "Party")  
  
The concept is still the same: Since the plot of BE stories only exists as an excuse to grow breasts, it can as well be cut down to leave more room for detailed growth. Like the title suggests it features more of everything the original had: More breasts, more growth, more girls, more detail, and more... length. The length was actually the only thing that bothered me about the original, and now the sequel turns out to be one of my longest stories on DA XD  
  
Thanks to everyone who enjoyed "Milk for a Maiden", I hope you like this story just as much ![:D](./I3reacl_files/biggrin.gif ":D (Big Grin)")

LOL , cute , sexy , funny . I enjoyed your story , well written except for a few misspellings . The problem I always have with these stories is where did all that extra breast mass come from ? One 12oz glass of milk does not equal a hundred lbs of boob . Just my problem not a complaint about the fantasy in your story . " Dam logical mind anyway "

Thanks ![:)](./I3reacl_files/smile.gif ":) (Smile)") My opinion on that is that the concept of rapidly growing breasts in intself is so ridiculous and unrealistic there is no need to explain where the extra mass is coming from^^

Exelent Work! And on a side note: yes the story of BE stories can be cut diown some usually, but add more story to them and you can get a reason or 2 (or an excuse) to make a sequal or maybe even turn it into a multi part story! You don't have to if you don't want to though, just an idea or 2 you might like.

**Firefly Magic**Fireflies,  
lanterns at the rear,  
swarmed in the warm Illinois night.  
And I, young and bereft of fire,   
stood in wonder  
of their lit-up magic.  
  
A waking dream  
on the edge of reality.  
I remember their tail lights, still.  
  
Even then, I had no wish  
to capture fireflies;  
I could not hold them in tight fists.  
They were too free for that  
and I too caged.  
  
I want magic in my life.  
A little light,   
a tiny lantern.  
  
I'm years away

Lost in my own frontyard,  
I sense no wonder,  
only the empty buzz of mosquitoes.

Life itches.  
Life calls for a liberal dose of calamine lotion.

The absolute number
one cause of
rejection of DD
suggestions for most
Artisan Craft CVs is
poor photography.
There is nothing
worse than seeing an
otherwise brilliant
piece ruined by a
dodgy photo. But
even beyond DD
acceptance, if you
want to people on dA
to be able to
appreciate your
skill you...

**More Milk for More Maidens**"Aren't you done changing yet, April?", Victoria yelled from the kitchen. As her younger co-worker didn't reply she sighed. "Man, first day in our first job, and she can't even get into her uniform." Lowering her green eyes the tall girl looked at the clothes she wore: A short black dress alongside a white apron and matching boots. There was also a white maiden's cap tucked into her short crimson hair. "The chief maiden will be here any moment", she mumbled. "Said something about a "special test" on the phone. And that butler just gave us our uniforms and told us to go straight into the kitchen once we have changed � the rich surely are](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/More-Milk-for-More-Maidens-201845822) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Bikini Body**"Okay, I've added the cat-ears. Now, do you think I'd look better with a bunny nose or a bird beak?" The 22-year old college girl shifted a little on her couch so she could hold her pencil better, while making a few alterations on the semi-anthropomorphic sketch of herself. Between her right shoulder and ear she was holding a telephone from which she impatiently awaited a reply. Meanwhile, the other occupant of the couch looked up at her with a similarly impatient look in her eyes. "I swear I've already fed you twice today, Mitty", she told her begging pet.  All the black cat responded was "meow" before getting up and jumping off th](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Bikini-Body-251846519)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**The genie from the milk bottle**There weren't many people who could open a door with their feet, but Amanda was one of them.  
  
Holding the key between her toes the young woman put it into the keyhole, bending a little backwards. She had to be careful nothing would fall out of the box she was carrying in her arms. �That was a good day", she said to herself, looking at all the plastic items, cans and other garbage she had collected. �I can make a lot out of this stuff!"  
  
With little effort she tilted the key around, opening the door. Her apartment looked like one would expect it from a 24-year old woman, maybe a bit larger than the average. The greatest difference be](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/The-genie-from-the-milk-bottle-196457100)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Phone Call BE**"I can't believe this guy!"  
  
Amanda shut the door behind her, all small objects in her apartment shaking at the impact. "How he can turn down me, Amanda Manor, the probably hottest girl in entire high school!? I prepared so hard for this: I made my hair for two hours, tanned my skin in the solar studio and put on the smallest, tightest jeans skirt I could fit in!" Putting her hands into her tank-top she pulled two bundles of cotton out of her bra, reducing her cup-size to a modest B. "I even stuffed my bra more than usually", she sighed. "Now how shall I get a date until Friday?"  
  
After throwing the cotton away she grabbed her telephone, push](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Phone-Call-BE-187436187)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**In retrospect...**Sarah stared into her glass, blushing slightly. With the straw she drew circles on the surface of her juice, nervously shifting around on her chair. �Sooo, how do you feel?", she asked, not looking up from her glass.  
  
�Like a milk-cow", the woman next to her said. Around them, Sarah could hear the whispers of the other guests at the street caf�, constantly glaring over to their table. People passing on the street gazed towards them, their eyes nearly popping out of their heads. �You know, one of those genetically modified with the fat udders."  
  
Silently, Sarah took a sip from her orange juice � coincidentally, &#](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/In-retrospect-202581465)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**A Hardware Upgrade**Since she was a child Jean had always loved flying. Though it was over twenty years ago she could still remember the first time when she had entered a plane. She was so nervous she had hold tightly to the arm of her mother the entire time on the airport, and once they sat inside immediately grabbed the leans of her seat. When the plane took off she almost screamed, and couldn't calm down until the signs for the seatbelts had gone off. But as she dared a look outside the window after a while and stared at the sea of white fluffy clouds and the beautiful landscape beneath the plane all her fear was immediately replaced with utter awe.

**Tale of the sexy ninja girl**It was a dark night somewhere in the ancient Japan. Carefully, Ayumi peeked out of the small bush she had chosen as her hideout. A few hundred feet ahead of her was the castle she had to infiltrate, the only way inside being a well guarded gate. The young ninja quickly crawled out of the bush, sneaking towards a nearby tree. Before she could hide behind it though she accidentally tripped over one of its roots, and fell onto her face. Cursing at the moonless night she hastily checked if the guards had heard her. Once she was sure nobody had taken notice of her presence Ayumi covered behind the tree, while taking an old paper scroll from her we](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Tale-of-the-sexy-ninja-girl-204211313)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**30k Birthday Celebration**There wasn't really much to associate with the number 30. One of the bloodiest wars in history lasted 30 years, some months have 30 days, and according to Wikipedia there was a band called "30 Odd foot of grunts", but it really isn't a special number. So as Gina turned into the driveway of her home she told herself it was no big deal today was her 30th birthday.  
  
Gina parked in front of her garage, looking at the clock before she shut down the engine. 7pm � it had really been a long day of work. Not that she minded it, she liked her work. And that way, she was able to distract herself a little. Her colleagues had also made it easy for he](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/30k-Birthday-Celebration-268587999)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**A Witchy Accident**"Lalala-lala~♪"  
  
The lovely voice of a young lady echoed through the bathroom, filling it with a cheerful melody. Inside a full bathtub the source of the music, a young woman in her early twenties was taking a bath, chirping this little tune while she thoroughly rubbed some foam over her leg. The water pearled off her skin as she stretched her leg into the air, reflecting the light of the ceiling lamp and the full moon that was shining through the window. "Ah, there's nothing like a hot bath", the woman sighed. The tips of her purple hair sunk into the water as she put her head back a little and glided a little deeper into the bathtub.](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/A-Witchy-Accident-272934324)

**The BE Dream**The BE Dream  
  
I close my eyes and begin to dream, waiting for my mind taking me on a journey of magical thoughts. Within a couple of minutes, my dream begins.  
  
I'm sitting in my room, looking in the mirror at my body.  
  
"I wonder what it'd be like if my tits started growing?"  
  
I put my hands on my hips, and leaned forward towards the mirror. I was wearing a pair of black shorts that hugged my thighs nicely, and a pink tank top. My black hair dangled down as I stared into the mirror, smiling at the thought of my boobs growing, bigger and bigger....  
  
Then it happened.

Kristy was relieved and thankful that someone had finally accepted her job application. Being fresh out of school she had barely any experience in anything but skipping school. It was 6 o clock at night as she got ready to go to her new job, she was happy that the uniform was optional. Looking at herself in the mirror she posed and blew a kiss to her reflection. She considered herself pretty average, Brown hair with the front tips dyed light blonde, About 5 foot 4 she was normal height with C cup sized breasts, she was slim with a toned belly.

Jenny was in the kitchen of her apartment preparing dinner. Ever since she had graduated high school, she finally started to feel more responsibilities as life came towards her. Although she was only nineteen tears old, she had a pretty decent job that paid good money. Living in an apartment was okay for her as she didn't have to pay a whole lot of money besides the rent and other necessities.  
  
She was always a smart girl, always above average in her classes back in high school. She had long brown hair, and had a great smile. Her cheeks had just a touch of red; almost as if she were blushing, and she had sexy lips](http://blueberryjanelle.deviantart.com/art/Jenny-s-Busty-Surprise-170338964) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Lisa and Mona - Chapter 1**The sun had barely begun to rise when Mona's alarm clock rang. Hitting the snooze button, she considered closing her eyes and going back to sleep, just as she did every morning. However, looking down at her chest gave reminded Mona why she needed to be up so early before work. So, with a great deal of effort Mona sat up, and eventually she made her way out of the bedroom and into the bathroom.  
When she had started her new job, Mona possessed a natural C-cup bust: nothing to brag about, but then again nothing to be scoffed at either. She was a reasonably endowed woman with little cause for dissatisfaction, or so she had been told.

**Milky Magic Part Two**Milky Magic  
Part Two  
  
I turned around and faced Brad, my breasts drooping down, pulling the wrinkles in my shirt taunt.  
  
�What are we gonna do?� I asked with a worried look on my face as I looked down.  
  
Brad thought for a moment.  
  
�Well�.I know this sounds kinda�.weird but uhmmm�.�  
  
�Yeah!?� I asked.  
  
�Well�what if you uhmm�.�squeezed� the milk out�ya know?�  
  
I gave him this look.

"Hey Jan, what's up?"  
  
I turned my head and saw Katrina standing a few feet behind me. Since she was a witch, she could teleport anywhere she wanted, whenever she wanted.  
  
"Nothing, just doing the dishes. A better question yet; why are YOU here?"  
  
"Well I'm really bored," she replied.  
  
"Isn't Clara around?"  
  
"Yeah, but I wanted to come visit for a bit. Where's Jess?"  
  
"She went to a friend's house and will be back in a couple hours."  
  
I went back to cleaning the dishes, then Katrina tapped me on the shoulder.  
  
"Can we make out?" Katrina asked.  
  
"Ha, no! You know I'm dating Jess," I said, going back to the dishes.

Stacy took a deep sigh and looked up at the stars. What a beautiful night. A clear dark sky with the moonlight shining down on her face, and the cool night breeze brushing up softly against her body.  
  
She wasn't the type of girl who obsessed over her body, but she had to admit that her body did look good. She didn't show off at all, she was just really proud to be who she was. The only thing she wasn't too happy about - her boobs. She wanted them bigger than they were. She wanted to get at least a little attention, was that too much to ask?

It was a dark, chilly night, and Michelle was walking home from work. She couldn't believe how cold it was. I mean after all, she was wearing shorts and didn't expect anything of it. Michelle was practically freezing. All she was wearing were the shorts, a shirt, and some sneakers since she didn't think about bringing her coat. "Why does it have to be so freaking cold out?", she asked herself. She carried her work clothes under her arm.  
  
She was a waitress for the biggest fast food joint in town. Everyone would go there, all the time. Which also meant that the place was very very busy. Everytime she'd work, some guy woul](http://blueberryjanelle.deviantart.com/art/The-Witches-BE-Spell-159719347)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)

Katrina looked up and saw us walk into the potion room. She dropped something into the cauldron, before looking back down into it, "Oh, hey. You four showed up after all."  
  
"Well, duh! We told you we'd come," Kylie rolled her eyes. "And besides, we're not like you where you just randomly show up at our houses at the most unexpected times...."  
  
Katrina's eyes looked up at Kylie, "What's that supposed to mean."  
  
"Well, both you and Clara do that. Just teleport to places randomly."

 "Man, what an old-fashioned uniform!", May sighed, glancing at her black house-maiden dress and white apron. In her long, curly hair, she wore a white maiden cap, while black high-heels and white socks covered her feet. "Well, at least the skirt is short." Cleaning the kitchen table, the brunette then saw a bottle of milk. "Hey, milk!", she said, grabbing the bottle. "If my new boss pays me so lousy, he can't complain if I drink some of his milk." Opening it, she emptied the bottle with a few gulps, ignoring the warning label "FROM GENETICALLY MODIFIED COWS � MAY CAUSE SWELLINGS ON SOME PERSONS".  
  
Just as she put the bottle down again, May felt a strange sensation in her torso. She looked down on her chest, putting her hands on it. Her blue eyes then widened in disbelief: It looked like her breasts were bulging out from her body � not only that, but she could also feel them pressing against her palms.   
  
Shocked, the nineteen-year old stumbled backwards, dropping her cleaning rag as she removed her hands from her chest. With a steady pace, her white apron was pushed away from her body, two mounds of flesh forming inside her uniform. Her practically non-existent chest began to grow into something one could call a bosom, standing slightly out from her slim figure. The fabric of her clothes stretched, lying a bit tighter on her body now.   
  
Partly scared, but also amazed May put her hands back on her growing bust. Though still rather small, her breasts felt very soft. Still, she wasn't completely convinced this was her body that was changing. Maybe the milk was just bad and she hallucinated. To test it, she clenched her modest endowments, both having the size of tennis balls by then.   
  
The smooth spheres of flesh gave in to her hands, her nerves sending a pleasurable feeling through May's body. She swallowed - the fresh-baked maiden realised this was *not* a hallucination. Her breasts were still growing, pressing against May's palms as she continued to embrace her sensitive assets.   
  
When she let go of them, May was already host to a pair of large grapefruits. At their sides, her skin was beginning to shine through the black fabric of her dress. She then blushed: Her nipples were poking through the apron � maybe she had enjoyed herself a bit too much.   
  
While May was still unsure if she should cry or cheer, her breasts in the meantime began to press against each other, causing the young employee to tremble slightly. Numerous sensations hit her, growing stronger as her breasts squeezed against each other in her uniform. Slowly, a smile began to form on the maiden's face. Slipping her hands under her apron, she placed them beneath her breasts. The fabric of dress was still between her fingers and her chest, but already touching it like this made her shake from the pleasure. She could clearly feel the softness of her new softballs, her nipples growing larger as they pressed her sensitive skin against her dress, her hands and each other.   
  
Purring like a cat, May began to move her fingers. At first, it felt ticklish, forcing her to chuckle slightly. But there was also something much more pleasurable to it, and the more she continued to stroke herself like this, the more her purring turned into low, soft sounds of satisfaction.   
  
May smiled. The only thing that bothered her though was her uniform that started to hurt her. Also, much to her dismay, it seemed to block the expansion. But as her breasts surpassed D-cups, the fabric began to tear below her neck. Only showing off the absolute minimum of cleavage at first, her breasts deepened the rift in their growth, exposing more of May's body. A delicate V-neck formed, revealing continuously more of her bosom which stood firmly out from her body. Yet her breasts felt so soft � May removed her hands, only to put them on the sides of her breasts. A lot less restrictive than before, she began to fondle her breasts, starting to massage herself after a while. May's soft flesh gave in as her fingers ploughed through her breasts, her moans growing louder.   
  
Her breasts meanwhile were already bigger than her head, and showed no signs of stopping. Her cleavage also continued to grow, the end of the rift already covered beneath the apron. The fabric of her dress slid down, revealing the sides of her bosom. Soon, the top of her breasts was only covered by the holders of her apron. May blushed, but not out of embarrassment: Since the fabric didn't cover her anymore and she could touch her skin directly now, the intensity of her massage had grown. Her nipples lanced through her apron, May feeling as her dress slid down her chest. Her breasts, standing at basket-ball-size, were now only covered by her immensely tight apron.  
  
While she kept kneading her chest during its growth, panting began to mix into May's moaning - this was starting to exhaust her. Nonetheless, she pressed her palms stronger into her flesh, trying to get the most joy out of it as possible. It was a miracle by then the little apron could still hold against May's massive mammaries: The entire top and sides of them were bare from clothes, her dress covering May from her waist on again. The white apron just barely covered her nipples, its holders meanwhile digging deep into her flesh. As her breasts reached medicine ball measures, they pushed the fabric of the apron so far aside, the pink areola around her thumb-stick nipples was uncovered.   
  
May was breathing heavily, sweat dropping from her face. The cool liquid fell into her cleavage, slowly sliding down her soft spheres, vanishing inside her cleavage. The maiden's lips began to shake, alongside the rest of her body, while her nipples enlarged once more. An incredible feeling overcame her, her mind beginning to identify herself with her breasts: She was so huge, so soft, still so firm and round, not saggy or morbid. Stopping her massage, she simple squeezed her breasts together now as she enjoyed the last seconds of her growth. Her tongue hanging out from her mouth, she felt her breasts pressing against her palms while she, at the same time, was pushing them together, making them flow over her apron.   
  
Just as her apron was reaching its limits, the growth stopped. May looked down on her jack fruit-sized breasts, exhausted, but still grinning. "The job description was right � the work DID expand my horizon!♥"

I wanted to write this since a long time: Personally, I think the plot of Breast expansion stories only exists as an excuse to make women's breasts bigger. So, since it isn't very important anyway, I decided to write a story that has no plot synopsis at all!   
  
The result is rather short, but it includs the longest, slowest and probably best expansion I have written yet.   
  
Enjoy!

maybe so, but after reading your "bikini body" this seems bland without an actual plot and just starting the expansion too early.

Sometimes I just think it's better without a plot, because basically all BE stories are predictable, ridiculous and full of clich�s.

Her gallery is filled to the brim with high quality stock photographs that have inspired deviants to get creative, and turn the already beautiful images into something magical. Jessica always takes time to reach out to deviants, providing contests and nurturing other artists. We're inspired by her selfless attitude and dedication to a genre that we couldn't create without.

**Tale of the sexy ninja girl**It was a dark night somewhere in the ancient Japan. Carefully, Ayumi peeked out of the small bush she had chosen as her hideout. A few hundred feet ahead of her was the castle she had to infiltrate, the only way inside being a well guarded gate. The young ninja quickly crawled out of the bush, sneaking towards a nearby tree. Before she could hide behind it though she accidentally tripped over one of its roots, and fell onto her face. Cursing at the moonless night she hastily checked if the guards had heard her. Once she was sure nobody had taken notice of her presence Ayumi covered behind the tree, while taking an old paper scroll from her we](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Tale-of-the-sexy-ninja-girl-204211313)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**More Milk for More Maidens**"Aren't you done changing yet, April?", Victoria yelled from the kitchen. As her younger co-worker didn't reply she sighed. "Man, first day in our first job, and she can't even get into her uniform." Lowering her green eyes the tall girl looked at the clothes she wore: A short black dress alongside a white apron and matching boots. There was also a white maiden's cap tucked into her short crimson hair. "The chief maiden will be here any moment", she mumbled. "Said something about a "special test" on the phone. And that butler just gave us our uniforms and told us to go straight into the kitchen once we have changed � the rich surely are](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/More-Milk-for-More-Maidens-201845822) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**A Witchy Accident**"Lalala-lala~♪"  
  
The lovely voice of a young lady echoed through the bathroom, filling it with a cheerful melody. Inside a full bathtub the source of the music, a young woman in her early twenties was taking a bath, chirping this little tune while she thoroughly rubbed some foam over her leg. The water pearled off her skin as she stretched her leg into the air, reflecting the light of the ceiling lamp and the full moon that was shining through the window. "Ah, there's nothing like a hot bath", the woman sighed. The tips of her purple hair sunk into the water as she put her head back a little and glided a little deeper into the bathtub.](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/A-Witchy-Accident-272934324) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Milk for a Maiden**"Man, what an old-fashioned uniform!", May sighed, glancing at her black house-maiden dress and white apron. In her long, curly hair, she wore a white maiden cap, while black high-heels and white socks covered her feet. "Well, at least the skirt is short." Cleaning the kitchen table, the brunette then saw a bottle of milk. "Hey, milk!", she said, grabbing the bottle. "If my new boss pays me so lousy, he can't complain if I drink some of his milk." Opening it, she emptied the bottle with a few gulps, ignoring the warning label "FROM GENETICALLY MODIFIED COWS � MAY CAUSE SWELLINGS ON SOME PERSONS".

**A Hardware Upgrade**Since she was a child Jean had always loved flying. Though it was over twenty years ago she could still remember the first time when she had entered a plane. She was so nervous she had hold tightly to the arm of her mother the entire time on the airport, and once they sat inside immediately grabbed the leans of her seat. When the plane took off she almost screamed, and couldn't calm down until the signs for the seatbelts had gone off. But as she dared a look outside the window after a while and stared at the sea of white fluffy clouds and the beautiful landscape beneath the plane all her fear was immediately replaced with utter awe.

**Story of the hot kunoichi**The armored guard stepped back until he felt the wall of the mansion behind him. Pressing his body against the wooden planks he watched half in fear, half in awe as the buxom woman slowly approached him. Her bosom and the rest of her body were wrapped inside a tight black suit that only revealed a small d�collet� at the top of the neck, displaying a subtle, yet very appealing cleavage. The face of the woman to who carried this pair of fabric-stretchers was mainly covered by a black bandana, only her brown eyes looking out above it. Her long, gorgeous blond hair was tied into a pony tail so long it almost touched the ground.

**Sexy Sisters**REAL WORLD  
  
Kurosaki Karin yawned as she entered the kitchen. "Morning, everybody!"  
  
"Morning!" she heard her twin sister say. Yuzu was washing the dishes, it seemed breakfast was already over. As she looked around when walking in, Karin noticed Ichigo and her father were already gone.  
  
"Yuzu, what time is it?" she asked, sitting down at the table.  
  
"10o'clock." she answered, turning off the sink before drying the last plate. "You were sleeping quite long."  
  
"Our class has no school today, why should I wake up early?" She let her head fall onto the table, still feeling rather sleepy. As she stared into the room, she noticed something was layi](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Sexy-Sisters-137756621)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**In retrospect...**Sarah stared into her glass, blushing slightly. With the straw she drew circles on the surface of her juice, nervously shifting around on her chair. �Sooo, how do you feel?", she asked, not looking up from her glass.  
  
�Like a milk-cow", the woman next to her said. Around them, Sarah could hear the whispers of the other guests at the street caf�, constantly glaring over to their table. People passing on the street gazed towards them, their eyes nearly popping out of their heads. �You know, one of those genetically modified with the fat udders."  
  
Silently, Sarah took a sip from her orange juice � coincidentally, &#](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/In-retrospect-202581465)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Snow Boobs**It was a late afternoon in December when a young woman was taking a walk through the park. Flakes danced around her nose as she walked over the snow-clad path, smiling at the white scenery around her. The branches of the trees were buckling under the weight of the snow, while the usually lush and green lawn was hidden beneath an at least two inch deep layer of snow. The path the woman was walking on wasn't quite as snowed, but her large winter boots still left deep imprints behind her. While it wasn't pitch-black the lanterns on each side of the path were already shining, their light reflecting in the surrounding snow, and with each minute th](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Snow-Boobs-275240349)

So, with a great deal of effort Mona sat up, and eventually she made her way out of the bedroom and into the bathroom.  
When she had started her new job, Mona possessed a natural C-cup bust: nothing to brag about, but then again nothing to be scoffed at either.

 The General's face crossed, as he leaped off the vehicle, landing on the sand in the freshly shined boots.

Pandora walked inside and set the keys down on the table. She looked around and smiled, "Janelle sure has a nice house. I'm happy she picked me to watch it for her while her and Jess were out of town."

Legend of the Attractive Shinobi Apprentice Shimanto Ayumi  
  
Slowly, Ayumi got closer to her opponent, careful not to make any noise. Sneaking up to the armored guard, the ninja girl carefully pulled out a shuriken from her weapon bag - three meters, and she would be in range. The moon shone down on the Japanese mansion, bathing the garden in its silver light. Ayumi was covered by the shadow of a building, her slender, but still female figure only vaguely visible. Two meters - she checked once more if no other guard could see her on the bridge. Luckily, they were either all inside the mansion or too far away. One meter. Pulling back her arm, she was ready to throw, her image reflecting in the pond below her. She could kill the samurai any moment � three, two, one�  
  
Suddenly, as she made a last step forward, her left foot hung up on something: it was her right leg! Waving with her arms, Ayumi felt as she lost balance, and fell forward. Dropping the shuriken into the water, the ninja girl hit the wood, landing hard on her chin.   
  
The guard on the bridge heard something, and turned around � to his confusion though, the bridge was empty. As he looked into the pond, he noticed however the water was slightly aroused. Closely staring at it, he tried to find something - or somebody. But after a while he just shrugged, and continued his patrol.  
  
As he was gone, a head poked out of the water. Though half of her face was hidden by a black bandana, Ayumi's brown eyes alone radiated a bad mood. "Jeez, not again."  
  
Shimanto Ayumi looked like an ordinary ninja, wearing a tight black ninja suit that underlined her moderate curves. There were only two things separating her from others of her kind: For once, her hair was light blond, quite a hindrance for someone who sneaked around in the dark. One may have pointed out now she could have covered it under a hat, or even simpler, cut it down. However, due to a complicated background story involving the death of her mother, a mysterious organisation of criminals, and the person she loved most - a story which would be great to tell, but has nothing to do with this tale -, Ayumi had sworn to always wear a ponytail, and never cut it shorter than a feet. So, since it was impossible to cover her hair under anything, she was the only ninja in japan who ran around with a blond ponytail.  
   
What made it even worse though was the fact that Ayumi was by far the most clumsy ninja in the entire world. She repeatedly fell over her own feet, missed targets from the closest distance, and cut herself when fighting with a sword(which was the reason she hadn't brought one for this mission). She had barely passed the ninja exams, and only because her father, one of her clan's highest ranked ninjas, had put in a good word for her. The only reason she was even sent on this mission was because it wasn't a very important one: she had to steal a scroll out of the mansion. The client, a rich feudal lord, had not said why he wanted it, but made clear it was neither of military nor political importance � Ayumi guessed it was some private love letter he wouldn't want anyone to see. As far as she knew, the mansion belonged to a very beautiful noblewoman who had lovers all over the country.  
  
Ayumi decided to avoid enemy contact for the rest of the mission. Slowly, she swam to the bank, cautious not to cause any noise or waves. Coming out of the water, she looked out for guards, then crawled over to a bush. She continued to move from hideout to hideout, eventually reaching a side entrance of the mansion. She pressed herself against the wooden wall � through a paper door, she had seen the scheme of a guard who was standing in front of another door. 'The scroll's in there.', she thought, wondering what to do now. A cool breeze then blew trough the night air. Ayumi, still drenched in water, began to freeze, and put her arms around her body. "C-cold.", she whispered, shivering. She then cursed herself: The guard had heard her! She wanted to hide, when she suddenly slipped over something wet � the water that had dropped from her body! She hit the ground with her back, crunching slightly, seeing the extension of the roof above her for a second before the guard stepped out into the garden.   
  
As he looked around though, he couldn't see anyone.  
  
Scratching his armored head, he began to search the near area for something. Meanwhile, Ayumi was sitting on the roof  - in the very last moment, she had managed to jump onto it. After making sure the guard wasn't looking, she grabbed the roof's edge, and swung into the mansion. However, she couldn't stop completely after landing, and fell through the paper door into the room behind it.  
  
Lying on her stomach, she put a hand on her aching head. "Owww.", she sobbed. "I'm so useless." She stood up again, pressing the water out of her hair � her suit had dried already, one of the many advantages of this clothing. She then looked at the hole she had pierced into the door: It didn't seem the guard had noticed yet as he still searched the area. Nonetheless, she knew it was best to hurry up. To her surprise, the room she had entered was not a storage for unwanted love letters, but an empty room with only one little table in the middle � and on top of it, the scroll was lying.   
  
'Seems like it DOES have some value if they gave it its own room.', she thought, walking over to the table. She grabbed the piece of paper � of course opening it was forbidden - and turned around. But in her haste, the scroll slipped out of her hand, and fell onto the floor. "Oops.", was all she could say as she watched the paper rolling up.  
  
Immediately it began to shine in a bright light, blinding Ayumi. She put her hands in front of her face, realising in shock why the scroll was stored in this room: It was a magic scroll! And even worse, she felt the spell was affecting her!   
  
"NO!", she screamed, forgetting she was in enemy territory. "Please let it be no curse! I don't want to be cursed! I don't�" A gasp suddenly forced it's way out of her mouth as the magic had triggered a sensation inside her. Slowly, a warm shiver began to run over her body, concentrating in her chest after a while. The warmth intensified, but it didn't become hot � instead, it was getting more� Ayumi tried to find a good word: Relaxing? Pleasurable? The ninja girl couldn't put it, but found it to be a good warmth.   
  
She had no chance to enjoy it however as the next shock already hit her: While she kept looking down on her, it suddenly appeared as if her chest was moving outward. Stunned, Ayumi put her hands on her breasts, clasping them.  
  
It definitely felt like they were growing.  
  
To prove it ultimately, she heard � and felt - the already tight fabric of her black suit was stretching even further. From the ankle of her eyes, Ayumi then noticed the scroll had stopped to shine, and dared a glance at it. In fine Japanese letters it read:  
  
*The greatest beauty  
lies not in a woman's face,  
it hangs down her chest*  
  
A breast growth spell? To Ayumi's surprise, she found this made sense: The feudal lord who had assigned the mission was known to be a pervert. And it would also explain the astonishing beauty of the mansion holder. While thinking about this, a pain in her torso suddenly reminded her of the situation: Her ninja suit, despite its tightness quite flexible, was reaching its limits, and pressed against her body. Her breasts had reached the size of armored fists, too big for her hands to embrace them any longer. Removing her hands from her body, Ayumi watched as her breasts swelled, becoming more and more buxom by the second. They were nearly spherical; though the more they grew, the higher were they dragged down by gravity, giving them a teardrop shape after a while. Touching her left breast, Ayumi's fingers sunk deep into the soft flesh. She closed her eyes as a surge of pleasure went through her body, feeling like something between tickling and pleasing herself. The intensive sensation made her hand tremble, causing slight vibrations on her bosom. Her nipples hardened, poking several inches through her top, when Ayumi snapped back and removed her hand again, still erected however. She was buckling under her bosom's weight, her back strongly aching, and wondered how long this would continue. The stretching of her uniform had turned into a permanent, loud screeching noise, which was eventually muted after a loud ripping sounded through the room.   
  
Looking down, Ayumi saw a hand-deep gap between her grapefruit-sized breasts, exposing some of her nearly white flesh. In her tight uniform, her breasts were strongly squeezing against each other, even as the rift got larger. Sadly, Ayumi also noticed they were growing a bit faster now, expanding over the sides of her torso, while another part of her uniform ripped apart. The two rifts united after a while, creating a hole that exposed half of her left breast. The growth continued, and with each pound her chest packed on, Ayumi's back arched further. She already had knock knees to keep herself from falling, severe pain tormenting her, but her breasts mercilessly continued to grow. More rifts appeared on her front, one by one uniting to a wide, V-shaped cleavage that continued to destroy her suit.   
  
Her massive milk jugs, about to surpass the size of her head, were dragging her towards the ground. Ayumi had to hold  her breasts up to ease the pain a bit. Her hands sunk into the sensitive flesh, causing the young woman to feel even more insecure on her legs. She had strong problems to keep a clear mind: the ripping, the holding, the weight, the pain, the pleasure, and of course the growth tore at her nerves � it was almost overwhelming her!   
  
Finally, at the size of pumpkins, she couldn't feel any more flesh pressing against her palms, and it seemed she wasn't gaining any more weight, too. Sceptically, she looked down at herself: A V-neck went down nearly her entire bosom, exposing more than half of her breasts as they firmly pressed against each other in her clothes. When she was sure she was at last not growing anymore, she let out a sigh of relief, and relaxed her pose a bit - a fatal mistake: Immediately she lost her balance, her breasts pulling her forward, and fell onto the floor. The soft mountains of flesh were pressed against the ground, creating both pain and pleasure as their diameter was reduced by half. Bouncing back, Ayumi slightly hopped on her bosom for a few seconds, steadily coming to a halt.   
  
Ayumi sobbed. She had been clumsy before already, but how should she work as a ninja like *this*? She wouldn't be able to hide herself, to sneak through the dark � and probably not even to walk around properly. Putting her hands on the ground, she lifted herself up, raising her butt so she was sitting on her knees. As she pushed herself up, she suddenly heard a voice from outside � and footsteps.   
  
Ayumi panicked. She tried to stand up, but couldn't lift breasts from the ground. Suddenly, her hands slipped off, and she fell forward again. Her chin would have hit the floor if her breasts hadn't been there, stopping it just before the ground. Helpless like a turtle on her back, Ayumi could only pray now as the guard entered the mansion.  
  
"Damn", he murmured. "I followed this water path, but it led me no�" He stopped. Standing in the outer door, he saw Ayumi through the hole of the inner one lying on her breasts, her butt still raised up, her head resting on top of her cleavage.   
  
"Um, hi.", Ayumi said. The guard didn't reply at first - he just stood in the door, covered in his heavy armor, looking like a demon with his iron mask. Sweat was forming on her face. He had caught her, a ninja � even if she was a lousy one, every warrior dreamed of catching a ninja once, especially the samurai. Ayumi was about to beg for her life when the dark, rough voice of he guard spoke to her, his words stunning the ninja apprentice:   
  
"Er, hello.", he said. He sounded quite nervous. "Um - can I help you?"  
  
Ayumi thought to mishear him . "Help me?", she repeated. The guard nodded. "Well, um, you could help me up if you want."  
  
"O-of course", he said, climbing through the hole. Dumbfounded, Ayumi watched as he walked over to her, putting his hands under her arms. Slowly and steadily, he lifted her up, though Ayumi's feet constantly slipped off as she tried to stand. She didn't get it: Why hadn't he killed her? As their faces were next to each other, Ayumi could take a glimpse at his eyes: Through the mask, he was constantly looking at one single spot on her body, his eyes widened in excitement.  
  
Following his gaze, Ayumi began to understand what was going on.  
  
"Th-thanks.", she said, still feeling rather unsure. He had put his arms on her shoulders, holding her up like this.   
  
"No problem.", he grinned, still focused on her chest. Slowly, his right hand began to wander downwards, the armored glove slightly erecting Ayumi as it touched her skin. "I guess this happens a lot to you."  
  
"Oh, you have no idea!", she replied, faking a laugh. The guard had lowered his head a bit to get a better look, his neck now uncovered. With a shaking hand, Ayumi carefully pulled a dagger out of her weapon bag, all the time checking if the samurai was still distracted by her cleavage.   
  
Then, in a harsh motion, she rushed the weapon into his neck.   
  
Immediately she pulled her arm away, leaving the dagger stuck inside her enemy. The guard put his head into his neck, gargling one last time. Then, Ayumi felt his hands were sliding off her shoulders, and he fell to the side.  
  
Having lost her support, Ayumi began to tremble, almost falling again. Putting her hands under her chest, she managed to maintain balance, her legs stretched out to create a solid stand. She was filled with adrenaline, her body covered in sweat. She looked at the warrior on the ground: He was dead, blood flowing out of the wound, but one could still see the lust in his eyes. She looked down at her chest again, staring into a seemingly endless valley of flesh - this time though, she saw an opportunity.  
  
"Could I�? Like this�?"   
  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  
  
The night was silent, only some crickets chirping under the beautiful moon. The guard at the main entrance yawned � night shift reeked. He wished it would finally be over, so he could go to the next pub and enjoy himself a bit�  
  
Suddenly, he heard footsteps behind him. Grabbing the hilt of his sword, he quickly turned towards the garden. "Who's there?", he shouted, looking around. Behind the corner of a building, he could hear a female voice say something. "Come out! And speak up!"  
  
The blond head of a girl poked around the corner, her long ponytail nearly touching the ground. Half of her face was hidden behind a black bandana. "Excuse me", she said, trying to sound innocent and helpless. "But�"  
  
"Shut up and come out!", the guard interrupted her. "I wanna see you completely."  
  
Behind her bandana, he believed the girl was smiling. "Oh, of course you want.", she chuckled, disappearing again. The samurai got mad and was about to draw his sword, when the mysterious woman lurked her head out again. He was surprised though as it looked very strange now: Her eyes, ears and hair seemed to have disappeared, and the bandana looked different, too. Also, it seemed to be bigger than before. Suddenly, her real head popped up, alongside the rest of her body, and the guard dropped his jaw when realising what the fake head REALLY was.  
  
Just a few feet in front of him was the biggest, roundest, firmest pair of breasts he had ever seen in his entire life. The girl, dressed in a tight black suit, turned towards him, presenting enough cleavage to swallow his entire head, with his helmet! He was completely sucked up by her chest, not noticing their holder had trouble to walk straight. No courtesan he knew had so large breasts, and he knew quite a lot. Not even his mistress, who was famous for her beauty, could compete with this person.   
  
Ayumi giggled, watching amused as the man openly stared at her bosom. "Excuse me", she said again, not as innocent as last time though. "But doesn't a real gentlemen put his hat off in front of a lady?"  
  
"Huh?� Oh, s-sorry." The man quickly removed his mask and helmet, storing them under his arm. Ayumi examined him: His hair was messy, and he didn't look like he could read. A dull smile on his face, he continued to stare at her with big eyes. "So, um, miss�"  
  
�Shi � man - to.", she said, speaking very slowly. The way she pronounced every syllable made the guard shiver.   
  
"A-All right, m-m-miss Shima-manto�"  
  
"No.", she interrupted him."Shi � MAN � to. Like the river."  
  
The guard swallowed. "Um, what can I do for you?"   
  
Ayumi put her hands over her head, stretching her body as she stuck out her chest. "Oh, quite a lot.", she replied, giving the man a seductive glance. He blushed. Relaxing her pose again, Ayumi crossed her arms behind her back, lowering her head as if she had done something bad. "You see, I got lost on my way home, and suddenly ended up here." She circled her foot around the ground, carefull not to lose balance as she played the helpless girl. "And now it's sooooooo dark, and I am soooooooo scared to walk home alone." Looking straight at the guard who could barely keep himself from drooling, she leaned slightly forward. "Soooo, would you mind escorting me?"  
  
He scratched his head."W-Well, you see, I-I'm not allowed to leave my post�"  
  
Putting a hand on her leg, Ayumi bent forward, letting her breasts hang down her body. "Pleeeeeease."  
  
The grin on the guard's face grew bigger, and more dull. "A-Al right.", he said. "G-go ahead�"  
  
"You first, mister.", she insisted, straightening up again. "But don't worry. I'll stay veeeeeeery close behind you."  
  
Erected to an extent, the guard turned around, lecherous thoughts in his mind. Maybe this night wouldn't turn out to be this boring after all�   
  
Suddenly, a metal object scratched his left ear. Confused, he then felt another one pass him on the other side. "What the�?" That was his last thought as a third shuriken hit the back of his head, killing him instantly.  
  
Seeing the man finally fall to the ground, Ayumi sighed, her hand still stretched out from the throw. "My aim's so lousy." As she turned around though, seeing at all the other dead guards lying in the garden, she was confident with herself. "Well, I guess that's MY way of the ninja.", she giggled, making a step forward. As her left leg followed however, it hooked up on her right one, and she fell forward. Her bosom hit the earth, making her body bounce a few times on the ground.   
  
Ayumi sobbed. "Well, at least I will land softly from now on."

Dunno. I think it's one of the best things I've written yet, but it's not that popular... on the other hand, you said with sugar on top...  
  
I'll think about it.

**One Sip**Since that night, I have believed in love at first song.  
  
You sang.  
  
Darling, you stirred your voice into the coffeehouse scents;  
It carried notes of inspiration and the flavor of your soul.  
  
You smiled.  
  
Your words trickled down my throat, and I savored their warmth.   
There was no bitterness, no dregs- just your heart poured out.  
  
You stood.

The absolute number
one cause of
rejection of DD
suggestions for most
Artisan Craft CVs is
poor photography.
There is nothing
worse than seeing an
otherwise brilliant
piece ruined by a
dodgy photo. But
even beyond DD
acceptance, if you

[:iconfaestock:](http://faestock.deviantart.com/) `[faestock](http://faestock.deviantart.com/) is one of our best known and popular deviants from the Stock and Resources community. Her gallery is filled to the brim with high quality stock photographs that have inspired deviants to get creative, and turn the already beautiful images into something magical. Jessica always takes time to reach out to deviants, providing contests and nurturing other artists. We're inspired by her selfless attitude and dedication to a genre that we couldn't create without. It's with great pleasure that we award the Deviousness Award for September 2013 to `[faestock](http://faestock.deviantart.com/), congratulations.  [Read More](http://today.deviantart.com/)

**Milk for a Maiden**"Man, what an old-fashioned uniform!", May sighed, glancing at her black house-maiden dress and white apron. In her long, curly hair, she wore a white maiden cap, while black high-heels and white socks covered her feet. "Well, at least the skirt is short." Cleaning the kitchen table, the brunette then saw a bottle of milk. "Hey, milk!", she said, grabbing the bottle. "If my new boss pays me so lousy, he can't complain if I drink some of his milk." Opening it, she emptied the bottle with a few gulps, ignoring the warning label "FROM GENETICALLY MODIFIED COWS � MAY CAUSE SWELLINGS ON SOME PERSONS".

**A special present**The morning sun crept out below the horizon, spreading its dim light over the niveous landscape. Flying over the white plains its rays reached a small house on the edge of a small town, where they shone through a small window right into the room of a small girl. Since it was quite early the dark-skinned child slept soundly inside her bed when the warm light hit her face. Slowly, she began to open her maroon eyes, groaning a little. Her black curls fell into her face, the little ribbons on top of each appearing as blurry red spots in her sight. At first, she wanted to turn around and sleep on � if necessary, she would even stand up and pu](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/A-special-present-190837645)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Dear Dairy**Dear Dairy,  
  
Whoops, typo! But it's kind of funny. Maybe I'll start all my diary entries like that? ;P  
  
Anyway, since quite a few things have happened lately in my life and I don't have anyone right now to talk to (at least yet) I guessed I could start a diary. Of yourse� again a typo, but this one happens actually quite a lot to me ^\_^; Anyway, of yourse it's not like I don't have any friends or a family. Right now, they're all just a few hundred miles away from me. I moved away from home a few days ago for college, and don't know many people here yet. And I'm not really the kind of person who likes to talk all day on the telephone. But](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Dear-Dairy-293882315)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**In retrospect...**Sarah stared into her glass, blushing slightly. With the straw she drew circles on the surface of her juice, nervously shifting around on her chair. �Sooo, how do you feel?", she asked, not looking up from her glass.  
  
�Like a milk-cow", the woman next to her said. Around them, Sarah could hear the whispers of the other guests at the street caf�, constantly glaring over to their table. People passing on the street gazed towards them, their eyes nearly popping out of their heads. �You know, one of those genetically modified with the fat udders."  
  
Silently, Sarah took a sip from her orange juice � coincidentally, &#](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/In-retrospect-202581465)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Short and Sweet**Lilly wasn't really a snoopy girl. But when she coincidentally witnessed as her mother received a package at the garden gate from the postman, and then went back into the house, acting all secret as if she wanted nobody to see her bringing some package into the house, and when Lilly afterwards spotted her putting a load of red bonbons from the package into a jar that she hid on top of the highest shelf in the kitchen, it was enough to make the short girl move a chair under said shelf, put a pile of books on top of it and step onto the books to reach for the jar.  
  
"Come on", Lilly murmured. She raised herself on the very tips of her toes, stre](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Short-and-Sweet-306536048)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**More Milk for More Maidens**"Aren't you done changing yet, April?", Victoria yelled from the kitchen. As her younger co-worker didn't reply she sighed. "Man, first day in our first job, and she can't even get into her uniform." Lowering her green eyes the tall girl looked at the clothes she wore: A short black dress alongside a white apron and matching boots. There was also a white maiden's cap tucked into her short crimson hair. "The chief maiden will be here any moment", she mumbled. "Said something about a "special test" on the phone. And that butler just gave us our uniforms and told us to go straight into the kitchen once we have changed � the rich surely are](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/More-Milk-for-More-Maidens-201845822) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Talk about "Breast expansion"**"Coming♥!... Stupid door, will you open... Ah, finally!... Cynthia, hello! Long time no see."  
"Hi, Claire."  
"Come in!� Nice top, by the way."  
"Really? It's just an ordinary blazer though..."  
"But it's blue! And it suits your skirt."  
"That's also very ordinary... just like my shoes... Clarisse, I look like a secretary! How can you say it's nice?"   
"Didn't you know? Conservative is 'in' right now."  
"Then why do you wear an orange tank-top and a mini-skirt?"  
"As if I'd go with the mainstream! And my skirt's not so short."  
"It's only half as long as mine!"

**Phone Call BE**"I can't believe this guy!"  
  
Amanda shut the door behind her, all small objects in her apartment shaking at the impact. "How he can turn down me, Amanda Manor, the probably hottest girl in entire high school!? I prepared so hard for this: I made my hair for two hours, tanned my skin in the solar studio and put on the smallest, tightest jeans skirt I could fit in!" Putting her hands into her tank-top she pulled two bundles of cotton out of her bra, reducing her cup-size to a modest B. "I even stuffed my bra more than usually", she sighed. "Now how shall I get a date until Friday?"  
  
After throwing the cotton away she grabbed her telephone, push](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Phone-Call-BE-187436187)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**True love only grows I**Tap. Tap. Tap.  
  
Again and again a foot was stepping on the ground. In a simple rhythm Britney tapped on the carpet of her husband�s office. From time to time a small click accompanied the tapping as Britney was biting on the nail of her thumb her teeth, chopping off small pieces in an irregular pattern. The bitter taste of the red nail lacquer rubbed off, on her tongue, only a very slight amount, but enough for her to take her thumb out of her mouth after a while and put it on her chin instead. Eventually she started tapping on her chin as well, offbeat to her feet. It wasn�t because she was impatient that she was tapping, and she](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/True-love-only-grows-I-360919581)

**The Expanding Date Pt 1**The Gift  
  
Katelyn checked and double checked herself in the mirror one last time. "OK, blush applied, lipstick on, eyeliner thick, hair brushed," she spoke into the mirror, then sighed, "situation, hopeless. Derrick will never ask me out." Kate slumped onto the toilet and sank her face into her hands, smudging her fresh makeup on her tear soaked palms.   
 A short time later, Kate's mother knocked on the door. "Kate! You're gunna be late! Get out of the bathroom so I can get ready. The college girl wiped her face and exited, meeting her mother outside, attaching her earrings and claiming the bathroom for herself.

**Troublesome Expansion**April took a deep breath, double checking the directions she had been given. "This is it" She whispered to herself walking up towards the door of the small cottage, a thin pillar of smoke rising up into the afternoon skies. She knocked her frail hand against the heavy wooden door, stepping back as she waited for a response. Her eyes read over the sign over the door, Nika's Magical Accessories.  
  
The door creaked open, a pair of large brown eyes peered out at her, "Yes?" A soft voice called out.  
  
"Uhm." April shifted slightly, she had never sought out such strange services before, "I-I am interested in um, buying something?" She offered weakly.](http://ginbug.deviantart.com/art/Troublesome-Expansion-189729210)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Lisa and Mona - Chapter 1**The sun had barely begun to rise when Mona's alarm clock rang. Hitting the snooze button, she considered closing her eyes and going back to sleep, just as she did every morning. However, looking down at her chest gave reminded Mona why she needed to be up so early before work. So, with a great deal of effort Mona sat up, and eventually she made her way out of the bedroom and into the bathroom.  
When she had started her new job, Mona possessed a natural C-cup bust: nothing to brag about, but then again nothing to be scoffed at either. She was a reasonably endowed woman with little cause for dissatisfaction, or so she had been told.

Pandora turned the key and unlocked the front door. She was still getting used to this 'human' stuff here on Earth, but she was learning pretty quickly. On her home planet, unlocking a door to a home was much more complicated than just turning a key. In a way, she enjoyed this version more, but back home, it was much more secure.  
  
Pandora walked inside and set the keys down on the table. She looked around and smiled, "Janelle sure has a nice house. I'm happy she picked me to watch it for her while her and Jess were out of town."

**Lisa and Mona - Chapter 2**Lisa watched over the course of a few weeks as Mona tried her best to control her lactation. It was a marvelous thing to watch as Mona's breasts swelled and shrank, the tide of milk ebbing and flowing in regular cycles. Every two days Mona's breasts would swell from a D-cup to and E-cup, filling up with milk until they could take no more, then spectacularly releasing it in one long gush. Mona had learned from her experience on the subway to avoid public places when she knew her nipples were about to release the flood, but it was hard to manage. She still had to work during the day, and there was always the possibility of a surprise leak.

Jenny was in the kitchen of her apartment preparing dinner. Ever since she had graduated high school, she finally started to feel more responsibilities as life came towards her. Although she was only nineteen tears old, she had a pretty decent job that paid good money. Living in an apartment was okay for her as she didn't have to pay a whole lot of money besides the rent and other necessities.  
  
She was always a smart girl, always above average in her classes back in high school. She had long brown hair, and had a great smile. Her cheeks had just a touch of red; almost as if she were blushing, and she had sexy lips](http://blueberryjanelle.deviantart.com/art/Jenny-s-Busty-Surprise-170338964) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)

April was cleaning around the house since she was going to have company over today. She had met a woman named Sabrina not very long ago, and had invited her over for lunch. April figured it'd be a good way to get to know more about Sabrina.  
  
Two of April's friends, Clara and Katrina, had introduced her to Sabrina the other day. The cool thing about Clara and Katrina was that they were witches, and could pretty much do anything they wanted; they were also twins.  
  
April had to admit though, that she did have this one thought about kissing Clara; she wondered what it'd be like. Clara was extremely cute and was ve](http://blueberryjanelle.deviantart.com/art/April-s-Big-Day-191673895)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Lisa and Mona - Chapter 4**Life was no longer tough for Lisa and Mona. Certainly there were bills to pay, jobs to work, responsibilities to fulfill from day to day, but that seemed to matter less and less as those days rolled on. Mona happily went to work every morning, and Lisa dove into her research with a new energy, both knowing that the end of the day would make everything worthwhile. Life seemed somehow new, and it was all thanks to the mutual relationship between breast and mouth.  
Every night the two would stay in their apartment and have their own milking session. In the confines of their bedroom they sat back and relaxed for a while, not wanting to rush thing](http://praedatorius.deviantart.com/art/Lisa-and-Mona-Chapter-4-175783463)

 It was a beautiful spring day, warm sunlight streaming into the large, Victorian mansion. A little, six-year old girl was walking down the floor, looking rather grumpy. "I'm SOOOO bored!", she mourned, her long, baggy skirt waggling from side to side. With each step, the silver ornaments on her purple dress knocked against her body, a feeling she had gotten used to though. Not knowing what to do, the little princess yawned, stretching her arms out from her body. Her sleeves ended in white collars, flounced like her skirt, covering the lower half of her hands while leaving free view on her tiny fingers.   
  
Suddenly, the girl stopped. Around the corner in front of her, she could hear at least three people talking. Happy about the diversion, she sneaked forward, wondering who it could be. Maybe her parents? No, they were not home, one of the reasons for her boredom. So, the girl figured it had to be some of their many servants, which of course were all too busy to play with her.   
  
Curious like little girls are, she carefully peeked around the corner. Four of their cooks, including the chef, were standing in front of a room. One of them, a slender man with a large mustache, was speaking.  
  
"�and the sugar? Did you measure it right?"  
  
"Yeah, yeah, it's fine", a small, grim looking cook replied. "And the milk, the butter, and everything else we used! Just calm down already, will ya?"  
  
Another cook, big and rather corpulent, sighed. "I really hope you're right", he said. "We spent the whole day making this "special treat" for our mistress."  The mention of a special treat sharpened the girl's ears. "We gave all our heart and soul into this. If it turns out we messed up, I might as well hang my cook hat on the nail."  
  
"Don't exaggerate!", the small man snapped at him. "I've done things way more difficult before. This may be the most "special" treat we ever made, but it isn't a hard one! So stop worrying about stuff like sugar and giving up on your career, everything's fine!" But after a while, he murmured: "Though I do wonder if I put enough cream on top..."   
  
Again the plumb cook sighed. "Guess we can just hope. It's too late to go back into the kitchen and change something. We have to wait until the evening, and hear what the mistress will say."  
  
The slender cook looked at an old, noble grandfather clock. "Do you think she will like it?", he asked, sounding a bit nervous. "It was her husband's idea, after all. She might find it a bit�"  
  
"If she really loves him, it'll be fine", the chef, a young woman with a blond ponytail, interrupted him. "Anyway, we should get going now. The groceries won't get done by themselves."   
  
The other cooks nodded. The little girl quickly pulled her head back, pressing her back against the wall. She heard as the cooks moved into her direction, their steps steadily getting louder. Her heart nearly stopped as they walked past her - sweat was running down her face, every muscle of her body stiff as a board. None of them took a notice of her, not even the small one, although he was just a few heads larger. After they had passed her, their steps slowly faded off until not even their echo resounded from the walls. In the distant, she could then hear a door getting opened, before it closed again with a squeak.   
  
The little girl relaxed her pose, sighing in relief. A sly smile then spread over her face, her eyes gleaming in excitement. A special treat! In the kitchen! With cream on top! She tried to imagine what mysterious gift had been prepared for her mother: A cake? A pie? A tart? Inside their collars her hands began to shake, her whole body shivering in expectation...    
  
Unable to hold back any longer, she dashed through the floors, her feet flying over the carpet. The ornaments on her dress rattled as she rushed towards the kitchen, her heart pounding heavier the closer she got. Overflowing with excitement, she nearly fell over her own skirt, sending her tripling for the rest of the way. Holding her hands in front of her, she just managed to keep her head from crushing against a door. After a short moment of shock, the little girl got all excited again: Right before her was the kitchen. Eager to see what waited there she swung the door open.  
  
Aside from being very large, the kitchen was rather ordinary. As she looked around, she noticed something lying on one of the counters, and walked over to it. Standing on tiptoe � why did she have to be so short? � she tried to look over the edge. The first thing she saw was a line of white whirls. A wide smile then grew on her face, the little girl staring with shining eyes at the special treat the cooks had talked about.   
  
A plate of creamy cupcakes.  
  
"Sweet!", she exclaimed, then quickly put her hands on her mouth. After taking a nervous look around, the little girl began to giggle: Cupcakes were her favorite snack ever! Sure, she may have said that about many other snacks before, but this time, she meant it!   
  
As she was about to grab one of the delicious sweets her hand hesitated for a moment. The cooks had made the cakes for her mom, not for her - and they usually were quite fussy about stuff like that. Also, she was forbidden to eat sweets before dinner.  
  
Once more she glanced over the counter. The white, puffy cream almost demanded to be eaten�  
  
"No one will notice if I take one, will they?", she told herself, reaching out her arm again. The little girl had to hop, her fingers constantly slipping off the valuable goods. It wasn't really of help she couldn't see more than the twirly peaks � really, why did she have to be so short? � , but at least she managed to pull one of them into her direction.  
  
Finally, the cake was close enough for her to grab it. With a victorious grin she held it before her face, her mouth flooding with drool: It was marvelous! Beneath the layer of cream the cake itself looked appealingly soft and sweet, slightly steaming as it was still warm. The little girl shoved the cake right into her mouth, gulping it down as if she hadn't eaten anything in years. A delightfully sweet taste hit her tongue as she bit on the fluffy pieces of cake, spilling the cream all over her face. After a few seconds, she had emptied the cup, smiling happily as she licked her fingers.  
  
A sudden rumble emerged from her stomach. She looked down at herself, patting her little belly. But as nothing happened in the next two seconds she shrugged it off. While she continued to "clean" herself, the little girl didn't notice her head was getting further away from the ground. Her skirt, which was usually dragged over the floor, began to rise, steadily revealing her blue ballerinas. The collars of her sleeves also slid up, while her frilly dress tightened around her torso. Unaware of what happened, the little girl jolted up in height, her eyes eventually in line with the kitchen counter.   
  
Satisfied, the girl patted her belly again, not noticing her belt line was higher than usual. "That was good!", she exclaimed. As she wiped the remaining cream from her face however, she felt it was a bit hard to move her arms, as if her dress was a little too tight. Also, her shoes were pinching slightly, like they were a few sizes too small for her. She then remembered her mother had once said  (after she had eaten a few cookies too much) that a lot of sweets would make her fat, so that she wouldn't fit into her beautiful dresses anymore. While thinking about it, the taste of the cupcake stayed inside her mouth. Chewing on it some more, her mind soon wandered off from her weight issues and back towards the remaining cupcakes in front of her...   
  
"Just a few more", the girl said to herself. She grabbed three other cupcakes, a little surprised she could reach them so easily all of a sudden. One by one she devoured the delicious sweets, just as fast as the previous one, spilling the cream all over her face again. Their sweet taste began to drive the girl into an obsession � no wonder the cooks called it a "special treat".  
  
Finishing the last cup, the girl let out a sigh, throwing the leftovers on the kitchen counter. Another rumble, far louder than the previous one suddenly sounded from her stomach, triggering another growth spurt. This time, the changes were hard not to notice: Little by little, her skirt rose up, uncovering her legs as they got longer and longer. Her shoes and socks seemingly shrunk around her feet until they completely broke apart, leaving the girl bare-footed in the kitchen.Her torso grew at a similar pace, though the girl found it strange her waist remained as slim as it was � nonetheless, it was getting pretty narrow for her. As her sleeves slid up her growing arms, her tiny child's hands reached out, growing more feminine. It became dizzy for the girl as her head rose into the air, the changes meanwhile also affecting her face: Her chubby cheeks deflated, her eye-lids extended, her childish expression maturing as she turned bit by bit into a teenager. Her curly hair also lengthened, remaining its position on her altering body.   
  
As her knees were uncovered, the girl suddenly felt her skirt rapidly getting tighter: Her formerly inconspicuous butt began to expand at a faster pace, reaching backwards. From unknown sources flesh kept flowing into it, the outlines of her bum steadily curving out. Her hips also widened, matching the lager form or her butt. The swelling caused her skirt's rising to accelerate, the rear going up faster than the front. As it rose over her thighs her legs thickened slightly, not enough to be called "fat", their clean, tight appearance underlining the firm impression of her butt.   
  
At the time her rear was growing the girl also felt something bulging out at her chest: Beneath her over-stretched dress, two small mounds began to ascend from her body. They pressed the fabric away, enlarging her head hole slightly � soon, she was able to take a humble look down at them, a small rift gaping at the top of her dress. A loud rip then announced her dress was crossing its limit: At her still slim waist the threads of fabric stretched over her belly, one by one breaking apart. Her dress split into two, both parts lying tightly on her new figure. As the strange entities on her chest shaped up the gap between them closed, her plump bumps squeezing each other.  
  
Seeing them grow, the girl wondered what these things were actually good for. She knew her mother had them as well, just like any other female adult she knew. Until now she had always thought them to stuff their clothes with cotton, so it would be more comfortable to hug their children - she had actually seen her mother once putting something into her dress before going out with her father. It always felt so soft when she hugged her mother, like embracing a white, fluffy pillow.  
  
White and fluffy, just like cream...  
  
Savoring the cupcakes' delicious taste, the rest of the growth went on pretty much unnoticed. Her already torn clothes were strained further as she aged, a small rip going down her chest. Intended to cover her palms, the collars now decorated her elbows, leaving free view on her fine, filigree hands. Above her naked feet, one could freely glance at her smooth legs up to the calves, the skirt only held by her bootylicious butt. Between the torn pieces of fabric her slim, but not overly meager waist was in complete loss of cover. With an almost grown-up face the youngster now towered over the once high kitchen counter, being more than twice as large as before.   
  
And as she looked down, she saw more of the creamy cupcakes�   
  
"No!", the youngster said to herself. "I had enough! These are for my�"  
  
Just then, behind the white ones, she spotted a plate full of brown, chocolate-garnished cupcakes.  
  
She suddenly remembered chocolate cupcakes to be her favorite snack ever.  
  
Leaving all qualms behind, the youngster took two chocolate cakes in each hand, and another white between them. Though she had already eaten four, her hunger wasn't satisfied: Like a pig she bit into the sweet-bitter cream, her cheeks soon rounded by tiny pieces of cake. One load after another she gulped down, her face spilled with white and brown cream as she dug her head into the tartlets.  
  
It didn't take long before the cups were empty again. Dropping them to the ground, the youngster suddenly felt strange, first thinking she hat eaten too fast. But as her stomach growled once more she realized it was no ordinary sickness that overcame her: Again her height increased, this time only a few inches, all parts of her body equally extending. Packing on some more pounds, the youngster gained a pair of incredibly sturdy thighs, her legs seemingly made out of rubber. Her already curvaceous rear rounded out further, the bulking buns swallowing her underwear. Flaring out a bit, the width of her hips soon matched the volume of her bum, her waist in comparison only slightly thickening. The last remnants of childhood completely vanished from her appearance, the transformation into an adult virtually complete.  
  
Again she didn't take much notice of her changes, this time however not out of ignorance: As the chocolate digested inside her stomach, a shallow tingle arose in her chest, spreading through the mysterious mounds that had formed on it. Her breasts, which had grown only slightly at first, suddenly started to blow up like balloons, the rift on her front quickly deepening. The fabric of her already tight top continued to dissolve, slowly revealing the rising domes of flesh beneath. With the growing pressure, their actually round shape got slightly demolished, the expansion seemingly weakening as the space constantly decreased.   
  
A weird feeling was cruising through the young woman: For some reason she had to blush, an unknown sensation growing alongside her bust line. Slowly, her top was ripping apart, her cleavage already presenting more breast than she possessed after the last growth spurt. Every single fiber of her former dress could be seen on her bosom, flesh flowing out of the numerous holes. With every grown inch, another part of the fabric broke away. Her constrained breasts then immediately shot forward, therefore destroying more of her clothing. As their prison slowly dissolved in this vicious circle, her ample balls regained their spherical shape, sticking out from her like solid spheres. Though there was not much left of her top, its leftovers began to crawl over her bust, exposing a firm under-cleavage. With little to cover herself, the young woman sported a pair of full double D's, undeniable marks of her freshly gained adulthood.  
  
Unconsciously, her breath had gotten heavier, interrupted by short, soft gasps. The weird sensation began to feel like a pleasure, one her still six-year old mind couldn't comprehend. Her luscious legs shivered at the unknown delight, but also as they fought to carry the meat on her chest. It seemed like her breasts had stopped growing, but the young woman could feel the pressure in her top was still rising. Stout as ever, her globes began to shake inside their jail, the movements of her bust rocking her whole body. Overwhelming bursts of lust rushed through the grown-up girl, the child inside her drowning in a flood of pleasure.   
  
With a doubling in size her breasts blew her top to pieces, bouncing violently as the young woman fell onto her knees. Throwing her head into her neck, she let out a strong, sensual moan, her whole body shaking like her bust. Their jiggling movement couldn't hide the firm appeal her milkjugs possessed, her nipples only slightly falling from the centers.   
  
With closed eyes, she put her arms on her outrageous rack. A warm tingle arose at the touch, slowly spreading throughout her entire bosom, before scattering into the rest of her body. Hit by the surging sensation, her mind completely shut off, her instincts now fully controlling her actions: With a crimson face, she pushed her creamy hands into the piles of flesh, tightening her cleavage. The stout mounds responded by driving her thrill even higher, "forcing" her to press harder. Despite its firmness, she could nearly press half of her bosom together, making the area around her hands look even larger. Though she was gasping in arousal, the young woman still didn't feel satisfied: With fast, twitching movements she began to grope herself, each squeeze sending quick waves of lust through her body.   
  
A charge of moans burst out of her mouth, the young woman strengthening her fondling. The sensation grew higher and higher, about to reach its climax, her whole body pumped with hormones. While she continued however, her voice suddenly began to fall, the power in her moans weakening - it was too much for her, she couldn't handle all this new feelings at once. After a few seconds, all she could do was throw out some husky wheezes, all the pleasure lost in a pool of exhaustion.   
  
Losing feelings for anything but her breasts she fell to the side, the monstrous glands jumping in all directions as she released her grip on them. Even without the pressure their size outdid her head's, taunting the physics of law with their unsupported firmness(even though that was hard to see while she was lying on the side). Her hair was scattered around her head, her legs spread out so her almost non-existent underwear gave free view on her juicy butt cheeks. Her moaning turned into panting, before drifting off towards a harmless form of hyperventilation.   
  
As the sensation faded off, the young woman slowly came back to senses. She held her belly, feeling a bit sick  - the many sugar started to backfire on her. Wiping the remaining chocolate cream from her lips, she noticed her hands had left some of it at the sides of her bust. Pulling her head forward, she tried to lick it off, but couldn't reach there with her tongue. With both hands she pulled her breast closer to her mouth, spilling more cream over it. In the end however, she was only able to lick some sweat of her skin. Disappointed she let go of her breast. The stout sphere jumped back again, the young woman watching the jiggle until it lastly came to a halt.   
  
With a chocolate garnished bosom, she decided to stand up. There wasn't really much she could do from her current position though, and rolling on her back seemed a little too risky. So, after some fruitless wiggling, she tried to get on her knees. While she managed to put her legs in a proper position, she had trouble to turn her torso �her breasts just wouldn't leave the ground, not even slightly. In stuttering movements she had to drag them over the glassy floor, their sensitivity nearly causing another calamity. After she finally managed to turn her front towards the floor, the young woman raised her butt. Her whole body was pressing against her bosom, cutting its length by half while doubling the width.   
  
The next step was to somehow lift these monsters: Putting her hands on the ground, she tried to do a push-up. The pressure on her breasts got lighter, returning it to their round shape, while the ankle between her butt and back decreased. The further she rose however, the more she struggled,  the load of her chest dragging her down. Just as her nipples left the floor, her boobs clashed right back on the ground, sending her whole torso wobbling. After a short moment of rest she tried again, only to fall back once more. The crashing and bouncing started to turn her on again.   
  
Taking a deep breath, she gathered all her power, the veins on her arms pulsating as she lifted her body. Again the squeeze on her breasts was reduced, until they eventually set off from the ground. Having their whole weight to carry, the young woman stopped for a moment. Then, inch per inch, her bubbles rose higher, swinging slightly as they hung freely in the air. With some effort, she managed to get her arms straight, squishing her bosom a bit. Crawling like a baby, she dragged her legs forward, changing her position into some more dignified. Her sagging breasts fell back on her body, her skirt falling low enough to cover a decent amount of her butt.   
  
Her arms were still holding her up. Wondering if she could sit by herself, she removed her hands. The full extent of her new endowments immediately became aware to her, but before she could react, the young woman fell forward again, leaving her exactly where she had begun: Bouncing on her bosom, slightly aroused, her bare butt pointing at the ceiling.   
  
Sighing, she prepared for another try, when her ears suddenly caught voices coming from the floor. She turned her head as the door swung open, her eyes widening in fear as four figures entered the kitchen.   
  
The chatter between them immediately died as the cooks saw their young mistress on the ground, buckled by her bosom while she presented her shining rear to them. Her body was shaking again, but not because she felt pleased.  
  
"Um, this doesn't look good, does it?"  
   
---------------------------------------------------------  
  
It was a beautiful summer day, warm sunlight streaming into the large, Victorian mansion. A tall, 22-year old woman was walking down the floor, looking rather grumpy. "I'm SOOOO bored!", she mourned, her large, baggy bosom waggling up and down. With each step, the massive mounds on her chest knocked against her body, a feeling she had gotten used to though. Not knowing what to do, the buxom princess yawned, sticking her chest out from her body. Her pink dress ended in a cut-open cleavage, flounced like her skirt, covering the lower half of her breasts while leaving free view on their still rich top.   
  
Wondering if she should go to her parents, most of her body stopped as she heard voices around the corner. Quickly the young woman pressed her back against the wall, only its highest part touching it though since she had to press her butt along. For the first time since a few weeks her distinctive shape became a hindrance as she sneaked towards the corner, trying to stand straight while listening to the conversation.  
  
"�and the sugar? Did you measure it right?"  
  
"Jeez, I think I have a d�ja-vu", the small cook sighed.   
  
The slender cook grumbled. "Well, after we messed up last time�"  
  
"I wouldn't call it a mess-up", the corpulent cook argued. "The fact that the cream cakes made our young mistress older doesn't mean it wouldn't have made our... um, more mature mistress not younger. The recipe said it would direct the consumer towards "perfect beauty", so the effect probably varies on the age. And" he added after clearing his throat "I don't think anyone here doubts the effectivity of the chocolate."   
  
It sounded like the small cook was shaking his head. "I can't believe we tried another one of those recipes! Haven't they learned from what happened to their daughter?"  
  
A small pause. "Maybe they liked the results�",  the slender cook said after a while. And in a much lower voice: "I do."  
  
"We shouldn't question our masters' decision.", the chef threw into the talk. "They pay us to cook what they want, after all. Anyway, we should go up and inform them..."  
  
"What was that?", the slender cook suddenly asked. He could have sworn someone had just passed through the floor towards the kitchen.  
  
The small cook shrugged. "I didn't see anything. You are just overworked."  
  
A wide smile on her face, the young woman dashed through the floor, her curly hair fluttering while she ran. No clapping came from her red high-heels as they only barely touched the ground, her long, slinky legs taking big steps. Her skirt, which ended just shortly above her butt's end anyway, leaving a faint view on her pink slip and what it not covered, now floated in her airstream, revealing a remarkable amount of booty. The copious bouncing loosened the hold of her dress, her braless breasts nearly slapping into her face. With her bust ahead she crashed against the door, causing tremendous waves on her body as she stumbled into the kitchen.   
  
Panting, she bent forward, accidentally airing her bum. Still swaying from the impact her breasts hung down her body, almost falling out of their generous cover. After recovering her breath the young woman rose her head, eager to see what the cooks had prepared.   
  
She dropped her jaw at the sight of the new treat.  
  
Directly in front of her, on a large roll car, the biggest, frilliest, most delicious looking cream tart in the whole universe presented itself to the young woman. In terms of size it easily outmatched her, being made out of seven grand floors, each decorated with numerous cream whirls and strawberries. Little chocolate figures had been placed on it, the one on top resembling an angel, while large areas were garnished with chocolate or strawberry cream.   
  
The drool was almost dribbling from her mouth. Lucky since cream tarts were her favorite snack ever, the young woman slowly moved towards the mountainous sweet, her breasts pounding alongside her heartbeat.   
  
One step before it, one step before she could grab a piece and shove it into her mouth however the young woman stopped. The consequences of her last snack forcefully pressed themselves back into her consciousness: Not only she had lost most of her friends during the last few weeks, she also had to study five hours per day to prepare for college, plus special lessons in posture. And as she was still a child in her mind, her body already teased her with enough mysteries in this age - like why almost all boys stared at her in such a strange way, especially on warm days when she dressed only lightly. Not to think what would happen if she got even older. Also, she had not forgotten how her mother had scolded her after finding out she ate sweets before dinner, the fearsome memory sending a shiver down her spine.   
  
On the other hand though, it was a cream tart�  
  
"No!", she said to herself. The shaking of her head send her bosom in similar motion. "It was fun, but I've learned my lesson. This time, I'll behave!" In a solemn motion she turned around, her legs and bust moving towards the door.   
  
Just before she left however she looked back once more, glancing at the fancy cake with all its adornments...  
  
Sneaking a little bit of cream wouldn't hurt, now would it?

An AP/BE story involving a rich girl, cupcakes, ripping clothes, a few pantie shots and lots of bouncing breasts.  
  
Pretty common stuff as you can see.

I love the story, I strongly believe you should make a series using the "special" attached to them.

Really, it's not so much the age in years, as the mental and emotional development of a person. Oh and physical too, of course, because otherwise that's just SICK. Really, so long as the mental maturation matches the physical, I don't see a problem with APs.  
  
Killer story by the way. One of the hottest I've read ![:P](./I3reacl_files/=p.gif ":P (Lick)")

yea, since her body actually becomes that of a fresh teenager it's very interesting, but the thought of her fondling herself feels wrong considering her mental age.

Every year between the ages of ten and eighteen, I sent a letter to NASA.  I told them a little bit about myself, the same general description year after year, and always insisted that despite my medical condition, I would one day love to sail through the stars.  My dream was to be out there in the universal abyss, exploring every unknown corner until we knew all that we could.

It carried notes of inspiration and the flavor of your soul.  
  
You smiled.  
  
Your words trickled down my throat, and I savored their warmth.   
There was no bitterness, no dregs- just your heart poured out.  
  
You stood.

[:iconfaestock:](http://faestock.deviantart.com/) `[faestock](http://faestock.deviantart.com/) is one of our best known and popular deviants from the Stock and Resources community. Her gallery is filled to the brim with high quality stock photographs that have inspired deviants to get creative, and turn the already beautiful images into something magical. Jessica always takes time to reach out to deviants, providing contests and nurturing other artists. We're inspired by her selfless attitude and dedication to a genre that we couldn't create without. It's with great pleasure that we award the Deviousness Award for September 2013 to `[faestock](http://faestock.deviantart.com/), congratulations.  [Read More](http://today.deviantart.com/)

The lovely voice of a young lady echoed through the bathroom, filling it with a cheerful melody. Inside a full bathtub the source of the music, a young woman in her early twenties was taking a bath, chirping this little tune while she thoroughly rubbed some foam over her leg. The water pearled off her skin as she stretched her leg into the air, reflecting the light of the ceiling lamp and the full moon that was shining through the window. "Ah, there's nothing like a hot bath", the woman sighed. The tips of her purple hair sunk into the water as she put her head back a little and glided a little deeper into the bathtub.](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/A-Witchy-Accident-272934324) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**50k Race**"All bikers to the starting line! I repeat, all bikers to the starting line!"  
  
Hearing the voice of the announcer Gina stretched herself one more time, raising her right hand far above her head while holding the left one on her hip. She tilted her body to the left and spread out her right leg, her blond smooth hair shining brightly in the afternoon sun as it fell to her shoulder. Finishing her warm-up Gina relaxed her pose again. She wiped a strand of hair from her face and tucked it behind her ear, while her blue eyes threw a casual glance at the large church tower clock above her. Only a few minutes before the race would start. She grabbed](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/50k-Race-318394036) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**B(l)Each party I**Buying a bikini can be a quite frustrating, if not even traumatizing experience for young women � especially when they bought it in the same shop as Inoue Orihime and Rangiku Matsumoto.  
  
�What do you think about this one?", Rukia asked, presenting Tatsuki a blue-white striped bikini. The tomboyish girl took a close look at it.  
  
�I dunno", she said after a while. �I think you are more the type for-"  
  
A loud snap suddenly echoed through the store.  
  
�Tatsuki!", a female voice called from the changing cabins. �The knot of my bikini always snaps open!"  
  
Tatsuki, looking slightly annoyed, took in a deep breath. �E](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/B-l-Each-party-I-244888694)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Tooth fairy meets Boob fairy I**It was a warm summer night in a little town. Moonlight streamed through the half-open window into the bedroom of a small house, bathing the bed inside it in a dim silver sheen. Underneath the blanket a woman was peacefully sleeping, breathing softly as she lay on her back. As it was a warm night she had only covered herself with her blanket up to her belly, leaving her chest and arms free. Between her small, yet decently shaped breasts the four buttons of her light blue pyjama top were resting, all being closed. Slightly they went up and down with each breath the woman made, rising and falling in a slow, steady rhythm. She barely made a sound](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Tooth-fairy-meets-Boob-fairy-I-330773257)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Breaking the writer's block(and bra)**Slowly the noise of stretching fabric filled the room as the dress widened under the swelling spheres within. Still numbed from the shock Roxanne stumbled backwards, almost tripping over the spell book she had dropped earlier. Her back hit one of the numerous book shelves in the library, forcing her stop. Pressing her hands against the books the wizard student nervously looked at her breasts, watching them grow from ripe cantaloupes towards larger sorts of melons, being far bigger than the formerly lithe girl had intended them to become. The cut in her already revealing dress widened under the increasing bulk of her buns while the pressure be](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Breaking-the-writer-s-block-and-bra-341655872)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Curse of the Holy Maiden**A long time ago, in a world that is not ours, there was a deserted wasteland far away from any kind of civilization. For centuries this country had laid abandoned, avoided by any kind of life form except for some creatures that dwelled in the dark. One day a young princess of darkness and her nefarious servant came to this unholy land in search of an exile. From the wrecking ruins of an old castle located on a mountain at the edge of this forsaken country that Dark Maiden had begun to build up an evil empire. One by one she conquered the neighbouring kingdoms without the use of any armies or weapons(at least not in the traditional sense).

�Like a milk-cow", the woman next to her said. Around them, Sarah could hear the whispers of the other guests at the street caf�, constantly glaring over to their table. People passing on the street gazed towards them, their eyes nearly popping out of their heads. �You know, one of those genetically modified with the fat udders."

**A Hardware Upgrade**Since she was a child Jean had always loved flying. Though it was over twenty years ago she could still remember the first time when she had entered a plane. She was so nervous she had hold tightly to the arm of her mother the entire time on the airport, and once they sat inside immediately grabbed the leans of her seat. When the plane took off she almost screamed, and couldn't calm down until the signs for the seatbelts had gone off. But as she dared a look outside the window after a while and stared at the sea of white fluffy clouds and the beautiful landscape beneath the plane all her fear was immediately replaced with utter awe.

**Mina's blooming roses**Mina was used to seeing strange things in the company, but a blank card sticking to her high-heel was even new to her.  
  
The blue-haired beauty with the golden eyes walked through the halls of her company, dressed in her usual working attire consisting of a three-buttoned white blouse with a large collar, an open blue blazer and a white skirt that ended just a few inches above her knees, tied with as a black belt around her waist. Some jewelry in the form of ear rings and a necklace with green teardrop-shaped pendants adorned her outfit. She had actually been on her way home already when she stepped on something with the tip of her high-heel.](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Mina-s-blooming-roses-290287098)

STORY:  
  
        Ciara was a normal 16 teenage girl. About 5'6 in height, long brown hair that went down to about mid-back, blue eyes. A nice ass, with a pair of  nice C cup boobs.

Instead, at nine o' clock this Sunday night, she had been freed from her other obligations. Her work at the local craft shop had let her have the day off � without pay, sadly. But there is no such thing as perfect luck �  and the next day was a school holiday county wide. She had been released from her cage!

The bottom of the blouse had been tied off, although how she managed to reach it remained a mystery.

 The armored guard stepped back until he felt the wall of the mansion behind him. Pressing his body against the wooden planks he watched half in fear, half in awe as the buxom woman slowly approached him. Her bosom and the rest of her body were wrapped inside a tight black suit that only revealed a small d�collet� at the top of the neck, displaying a subtle, yet very appealing cleavage. The face of the woman to who carried this pair of fabric-stretchers was mainly covered by a black bandana, only her brown eyes looking out above it. Her long, gorgeous blond hair was tied into a pony tail so long it almost touched the ground. The only thing the guard paid attention to however was the massive bust hanging from her, each of her breasts easily being as big as the woman's head. What really startled him however was that as she slowly came closer to him he could watch her chest was getting larger with every second, slowly ballooning outwards. He saw as the slopes of her fleshy orbs bulged out to all sides, heard as the fabric of her suit stretch around her growing meat and watched as the rift in her suit steadily grew deeper, her neck being filled out by steadily more cleavage. "What's wrong?", the woman asked, her voice soothingly seductive. With a wide step she closed the remaining distance between them, pressing her growing meat buns against his armored chest while leaning her face closely toward his. Behind her bandana he believed to see her smiling. "You look like you've seen a monster."  
  
The guard wanted to say something, but the words got stuck in his throat. His mouth was completely dry, though he felt like he could start drooling any second. Moving her body up and down the woman rubbed her bosom over his breastplate. Even through the hard iron he could feel their size and form, being big and lush balls of meat that defied the laws of nature with their firmness � and their growth. After a while the woman leaned a little back again, allowing the man to gaze into the deepening valley of her cleavage again as she stuck out her chest. Through his iron mask that looked like a demon-face he watched the slopes of her breasts slowly pushing the fabric aside, rising like dough in an oven as they flowed out of the increasingly tight neck in her suit. The V-shaped rift steadily grew wider as the fabric glided over the billowing form of her curves, exposing more and more of the woman's silky skin. Unconsciously the guard raised his hands a little, cupping his fingers as they drew closer to the billowing piles of flesh, ready to grope them. Whether he would have really dared this or hesitated in the last moment however will always remain a mystery, for as he continued to stare into her cleavage the woman suddenly drew a dagger from her belt and cut up his throat.  
  
Just as she had pulled the metal blade through his flesh Ayumi quickly took a step aside so she wouldn't be showered in his blood. Her sleeve got a few red stains, but those were barely visible on the dark fabric. The clumsy ninja then fought a little with her balance since the quick movement had thrown her a little off, her still growing breasts swaying into all directions as she moved her body. With one arm she leaned against the building next to her, bending a little forward and tilting her upper-body from side to side in attempt to counter the bounced of her bosom. Meanwhile the dead samurai fell forward on his face, still smiling lecherously behind his mask when he hit the ground. After shifting her body from side to side Ayumi finally managed to catch her balance. She panted a little in exhaustion, her heavy breathing hiding the still ongoing growth of her breasts a little. Rolling her eyes she could do nothing but wait for her womanly meat buns to stop their swelling, their increasing weight forcing her to lean a little further forward. The fabric of her skin-tight black suit was pushed over the bulging slopes of her bosom while at the same steadily ripping deeper at the end of her cleavage, therefore widening the amount of skin shown by the second. Pressing against each other they shared increasingly less room inside it, making the seams of the fabric creak louder and louder the tighter they hugged it. Strong sensations were going through the young ninja, sensations that strengthened the urge in her to moan and fondle her assets. Her lips quivered as she held herself back, sweat forming on her forehead and on the bare parts of her bosom that made them shine in the moon-light. She pulled a part of her bandana into her mouth and bite on it to distract herself, grinding the black material between her teeth while her growing humps swelled through the size of various "small" pumpkin sorts. When the weight and the pleasure became almost too much for her to handle and the fabric of her suit also began to give in she could finally feel the feeling of growth subside. Looking down on her chest she watched the last millimeters rolling out of her breasts, filling them with a bit more volume before they came to a rest inside her tight suit.   
  
Since she had experienced this many times before she resisted the urge to sigh in relief as it could have easily been the last drop that would make the fabric burst. But although she had seen this many times before she couldn't help but gaze at the sheer vastness of her bust: Each of her mammaries was at least as big as a samurai helmet, one of the largest sizes she had ever grown to. The round piles of flesh stretched her suit to its limits, while the fabric was unable to hold them properly and therefore let them sway and bounce with every little move she made. She waited a moment to adjust to the new size, slowly straightening her back as she didn't want to send her sensitive rack into too heavy motions. Even her breathing however was enough to make them jiggle slightly, audibly stretching the already skin-tight fabric of her ninja-suit as her orbs bulged forth and back a little every time she inhaled. Closing her eyes Ayumi tried to concentrate herself. However she was taught that the best way to find inner focus was to take in deep breathes, which in this case proved to be of rather doubtful success. She pressed her eye-lids shut as her breasts flared against the black fabric, small tingles going over the skin through her body. Her legs and arms were jittering slightly while she bit her lips, but eventually the kunoichi managed to calm down again. She took a look through the garden, checking if there were any others guards left. The only thing she could spot were the vague shades of the corpses she had hidden in the bushes. She wondered for a moment if she should hide the guard that was lying in front of her feet too, but eventually left him where he was: When all other guards were dead, who should find him before shift change at sunrise? And by then she would be long finished here and be back at headquarter. Hopefully.   
  
Slowly Ayumi sneaked over to the door the samurai had been guarding. With every step her upper-body tilted into another direction, making it hard for Ayumi to keep her balance. She carefully put one foot in front of the other so she wouldn't stumble, though it was rather difficult for her to tell how well she was doing as she couldn't see her feet behind the wall of flesh on her chest. Keeping one hand on the wall next to her she quickly made her way to the door, pausing there for a moment. Looking through the paper she saw the shade of a person sitting at a table in the room behind it. The ninja closed her eyes, preparing herself mentally for the task ahead. Slowly she opened the door, cautious not to make a noise. Once it was a rift wide open she quickly squeezed herself through it, wincing as she dragged her soft bosom over the hard edge of the door. Her suit creaked as it was strained further, her cleavage even ripping a little deeper and therefore causing the neck to widen slightly. Once her bust was through and hanging freely in the air again it wobbled slightly from side to side, forcing Ayumi's whole concentration as she felt pleasant tingles at every bounce. Once she and her breasts had calmed she took a quick look through the room.  
  
Quickly she found what she searched: A few feet ahead of Ayumi her target was sitting at a vanity, removing make-up from her face. Or did she put some on? As a ninja Ayumi didn't know much about make-up, so she couldn't tell exactly what she was doing there. Considering the time she was probably preparing herself for bed, but taking in the reputation of the woman (the clients for the mission were aristocrats and generals who used to be her lovers and had accidentally spilled out some valuable information to her) this didn't necessarily mean she was preparing for sleep. But Ayumi didn't really care about what she did there. If everything went right she wouldn't be doing it for long anyway.   
  
The young ninja silently closed the door behind her. The only light source in the chamber, a candle on the vanity, was too far away as that she could have casted a shadow on the paper wall behind her, so she didn't need to worry about anyone spotting her � not that there was really any guard left in this area of the mansion anyway, Ayumi just repeated the ninja routine in her mind. Her large breasts swayed a little from side to side as she ducked herself and slowly sneaked through the room toward the woman. Despite the extra-weight they had to carry from her breasts the wooden planks didn't make a sound as she approached her victim. She put her hand on the bloody dagger that was hanging at her belt, preparing to strike once she was in range. Her heart beat up to her throat � it almost felt to her like her bosom was vibrating from her heavy pulse. As she had crossed half the distance to her the ninja stopped as the woman leaned a little closer to the mirror on top of her makeup stand. Ayumi waited until she leaned back again so that it would be easier for her to press her hand on her mouth from behind when she sliced up her throat. Carefully she pulled her leg forward, her eyes fixed on her target.   
  
And then she stumbled over her own feet.  
  
"Not again" was the only thing she thought as she fell forward. Landing on her bosom she moaned as her body pressed on her soft flesh, her cheeks blushing red behind her black bandana. The woman on the table immediately turned her head, her eyes moving up and down as she watched the blonde ninja wobble up and down on her breasts. "Oh my, look what we have here!", the lady said. She put down the make-up brush in her hand, smiling as she looked over her shoulder at the busty ninja. Panicked Ayumi tried to stand up, but quickly gave up as her humongous bust tied her to the ground. She was as helpless as a turtle on its back. "Looks like I got a special visitor!", the woman stated. "Say, are you a kunoichi that came to murder me, or a concubine hired by one of my guards who took the wrong door? If it's the first then I would consider a career in fields that suit the form of your body better."  
  
Ayumi groaned. Bad enough she was busted, but on top of that her supposed target was mocking her.  
  
The lady stood up from her chair, and turned towards Ayumi. The ninja guessed she was in her late twenties, her face showing some slight signs of aging while still being very beautiful. She wore a black kimono with long sleeves that covered her entire arms up to the hands and had a cherry flower pattern on it. Her shining black hair was tied up in a classical Japanese braid with a red ribbon, while around her waist she was wearing a corset of the same colour over her kimono, tied at the backside also with a large ribbon. Ayumi also noticed the woman had a flower tucked into her hair, a red chrysanthemum in full bloom. Her face was adorned by a slight make up consisting of decent eyelashes and some rouge, subtly underlining its natural beauty. Her slim lips formed a smile as she looked with her grey eyes at the ninja who was grounded by her own breasts. Speaking of breasts, Ayumi noticed that the kimono of the woman was completely even around her chest, the fabric not bulging in the slightest. "Are you looking for something?", the woman asked amused as she noticed where Ayumi was staring.  
  
Behind her bandana the kunoichi blushed. "I-I'm sorry", she stuttered.  
  
The woman began to walk towards Ayumi. "For what, ninja?", she asked, holding one of her baggy sleeves in front of her mouth. "For staring shamelessly at my chest � or breaking into my private chamber and trying to murder me?" Ayumi gulped.   
  
The lady walked in circles around her, closely examining her. At every step of her Ayumi felt the heart-beat in her throat a bit stronger, while cold sweat ran down her face. However, despite the situation she was in and the fear she experienced, she moved her hand from her dagger over her weapon belt while she kept her eyes focused on the woman. Her fingers dug into the small bag that contained her throwing stars. "My, my, what am I gonna do with you?", the woman meanwhile asked herself, standing next to the ninja's face. "Call the guards?" Ayumi's whole body froze as she ducked herself and leaned a little forward. The woman reached out her hand for Ayumi's bosom that pulsated with her breath. With the tips of her fingers she softly stroked the bare part or her right breast. "Or maybe I should have some fun with you first?", she wondered, giggling into her sleeve.  
  
Ayumi suppressed a moan at the woman's gentle touch, but kept her gaze focused on her. While she was busy caressing Ayumi's monstrous jugs the ninja slowly pulled a throwing star out of her bag. As she was about to throw it into the forehead of the lady however her arm accidentally graced the scroll attached to her belt. The loose knot of the band around it opened. Another shock went through Ayumi as she felt the scroll falling from her waist to the ground, rolling over the floor. Without thinking she immediately let go of the throwing star and reached out her arm. Just before the paper could roll up she grabbed it, holding it with tightly while staring wide-eyed at it. Her suit groaned as she took in a deep breath, her cleavage almost ripping a bit deeper before the fabric was relieved as she let out a sigh. In the same moment however she felt the hand of the woman leaving her bosom, and saw her feet appearing right in front of her eyes. Silently Ayumi cursed herself: That probably had been her best chance to still finish the mission, and she had wasted it because she was didn't want to grow her breasts again!   
  
The woman looked at the scroll in Ayumi's hand. Her gaze then went back to the bosom that now bulged forth and back in fast spurts as Ayumi was panting in hysteria, for her throwing star had fallen out of the bag when she had let go of it. Surely the woman could guess now that she had intended to kill her. She probably wouldn't be that careless again and immediately call the guards. Then Ayumi would get arrested and spend the rest of her life in a prison cell.  
  
However, the woman did none of this. Her gaze just constantly switched between Ayumi's breasts and the scroll in her hand. Suddenly she laughed out loud. "And I thought I was the only one who got one!", she said, still holding her sleeve in front of her mouth.  
  
Puzzled Ayumi looked at the woman for a while, until she realized what she meant. "Wait, y-you have such a scroll, too?", she asked.  
  
Instead of responding the woman took a few steps back, and put a hand into her kimono. Ayumi's eyes opened widely as she pulled out a scroll from her dress, similar to the one that she was holding in her hands. Her shock increased as the woman suddenly opened the paper, holding it right in front of her body. A bright light emerged from the ancient writing on it, shining directly on the lady's slender body. A smile spread over her face as she felt her body being affected by the magic of the scroll, engulfing her with pleasant warmth. Then, slowly, a small movement was beginning to go through her chest. Closing the scroll again the woman tucked it into her corset and spread out her arms. Bewildered Ayumi watched as the even fabric began to bulge, slowly moving forward. In small steps her flat board began to ascend, forming a petite bump. The sides of her kimono arched as they were wrapped around the gentle curves of her bust. While the ninja stared at the prospering bosom in disbelief the woman herself put her head back a little, grinning contently as she took in the pleasure her growing assets granted her. Beneath her dress the small mounds steadily increased in volume, blowing out from her chest as more and more flesh rose up. It looked like she had put small sake bowls under her kimono, bowls that for some reason steadily ballooned out.   
  
The hint of a shadow appeared on the fabric above the lower part of her bosom as her flesh rounded out, moving at a less subtle rate over the rising slopes of her breasts. As the shade darkened and the roundings of her curves became more and more apparent Ayumi saw her kimono began to open, very slowly. The neck of the dress bit by bit widened as her growing humps filled out the space inside the fabric, smoothing it around them and pushing it aside. A low noise filled the room, similar to the sound Ayumi's suit made whenever she moved or breathed in, only it was more constant and coming from the direction of the lady. Stretching the fabric around them the sides of the lady's bosom grew gradually rounder as her mounds bulged from domes to small spheres, reaching the rough size of fists. The more accented the curvature of her breasts became the heavier the lady's breathing seemed to become, and as she looked at her hands Ayumi noticed she was twitching her fingers. On the end of her dress's neck then a small gap appeared, barely more than a few millimeter deep, but as the sides of the kimono moved aside it slowly grew deeper, the slopes of her breasts slowly showing in the growing cleavage.   
  
Leaving the scale of small behind them they swelled into more ambitious territory. The larger her breasts became the more the form of her curves was showing, the bulging spheres sticking out from her slender body. Adding to the rising noise of stretching fabric came the soft humming of the lady who was slowly giving in to the pleasure. Her head moved rhythmically from side to side, occasionally a moan slipped through her lips and the pleasure she felt was showing on her mimic, her mouth opening to a dull smile while she closed her eyes. Ayumi looked shortly up at her face, but her attention was quickly drawn towards her growing assets again as they bit by bit freed themselves from the cover of her dress. With each pound that swelled into it the gap in her kimono opened further, revealing a V-shaped excerpt of her bosom as well as a thin, small line of cleavage between her bulging walls of flesh. The almost pure white skin stood in great contrast to the black fabric that lay smoothly around her little meat bins. The lady then put her hands on the bottom of her breasts, and firmly cupped her firm mounds. Her palms embraced the lower slopes of her breasts, her crooked fingers reaching roughly half around them. Little movements were going from her hands to her breasts, her firm flesh giving in slightly as the lady groped herself with almost exaggerated care. Growing wider than her waist her bosom wandered into truly large dimensions, each globe soon surpassing the size of big rice bowls. The gap at her top widened to a wide and generous V-neck as the rim of the fabric approached her shoulders, while the tip of the V was close to the height of her nipples. The little breast warts began to shine slightly through the thinning fabric of her kimono, showing the woman's growing excitement.   
  
The pink cherry flowers around her bosom were already noticeably stretched, being both bigger and brighter than before the growth. Though the hem of her dress didn't really rise some fabric was starting to get pulled upwards through the corset tied around her dress. The tops of her breasts lapped over the part of her chest above them while their bottoms dented the fabric and hid her ribcage bit by bit. If Ayumi had crawled around her she would have seen the quite impressive bust line from the side perspective as it stuck prominently out from the rest of her lithe torso. The rather fragile build of her body began to show as it bent under the mass it had to carry. It didn't seem though as if it really was putting much strain on the woman who still visibly (and soundly) enjoyed herself, her hands now caressing her soft bosom with a bit more force. As her breasts reached the size of her head and she was noticeably leaning forward she straightened her posture with little effort, putting her head back as she let out a long moan of pleasure. Ayumi was startled to see the woman handling the weight of her assets with such ease, although they were almost as big as the pair of hooters that were tying the ninja to the ground.   
  
As ever more fabric was pulled around them it grew dangerously thin on the sides of her breasts, having turned from black into slightly greyish tone that showed her skin slightly. Ayumi could even hear from time to time some stitches creaking under the rising pressure when they were not drowned by the moans of the lady who had begun to rub her breasts in a circles, slowly and gently. She stopped her caressing for a moment and grabbed the sides of her V-neck, cooing as she embraced the fabric and her fingertips touched the skin of her bosom directly. Carefully she opened the gap in her kimono, relieving the fabric as it slid over her magnificent curves. Once again Ayumi gulped as she steadily uncovered her breasts, extending the amount of skin displayed and deepening her cleavage. The end of the firm and tight rift moved below the height of her nipples, falling down the ascent of her bosom, while the angle of the gap opened bit by bit until one could see her shoulders. As her cleavage reached almost the end of her bosom and the fabric was short before falling down her shoulders the lady removed her hands from her wardrobe, putting them on her hips while straightening her back again as if she presented wanted to present herself to Ayumi. In the meantime the sound of stretching fabric grew lower, while the sides of her dress wandered at a constantly slower place over the increasing girth of her bust. When they were roughly the same size as Ayumi's her breasts resided at their size, standing proudly and full from the woman's still slender body. Each of her gargantuan orbs was just as firm as the ninja's, being comparable to a samurai helmet or pumpkin. Mindlessly the young kunoichi stared at the display of feminine flesh that had spread just before her eyes, still not fully able to believe what she had just seen.   
  
The woman smiled in amusement. "I thought it might be better to just show you I'm a not a faker", the woman explained, proudly sticking her chest out from her body. "Though, to a certain degree, I guess both of us are kind of fake." Ayumi didn't reply, but just watched the rack bouncing up and down as the buxom lady walked through the room. "I bought this scroll la long time ago from traveling salesman", she told the ninja. "Back then I was just a shy introverted girl, the third daughter of the duke and therefore barely more than air for him, especially since my mother, his wife died during my birth. I was raised in a way that made clear my only role in the family would be to marry some other aristocrat so that our families would form an alliance. But after I fot my hands on this scroll and tried it for the first time, after I realized that it wasn't just a fairy tale that man had told me, and after I got over the fact a pair of giant udders was suddenly hanging from my body I slowly began to realize the opportunities they gave me. I tested my new "powers" on various of the male servants, the guards, and even some of other aristocrates that regularly came to visit my father. Soon I found that I could get any man to do what I wanted if I just could make my chest bigger, and suddenly a whole new world I had only dreamed off before opened up to me! As the mistress of the scroll, the goddess of bosom, I could whirl any duke or general around my finger! With the power of this scroll I rose up from the small flower that grew silently in the darkness of my family and conquered the sun all for myself, while my sisters and my father withered in the shadow of my breasts! Now I am the head of my family, one of the strongest women in the country, and soon the bride of the shogun! And it's all thanks to this little thing! Or rather�" She gave her humps a smack from the bottom, causing them to jiggle as she held them in her palms. "These little things!"  
  
Ayumi still looked incredulously at the woman's bust. She was completely at loss for words. Never had she considered another scroll like the one she possessed existed. But still, there it was, just a few feet ahead of her, tucked into her corset. And just like her own had been before she stole it, it had fallen into the hands of an aristocrat that used it to manipulate the men surrounding her and make herself a (literally) big player in the political game of chess. Using one's body to manipulate the dukes and generals to one's personal likings in those unstable times, while dozens of people died everyday � the thought made Ayumi's shudder. Then again, she used the power of the scroll for assasination � had she really a right to judge this woman? Quickly however Ayumi abondened this train of thoughts as she had other problems to deal with: Despite this revelation the situation basically hadn't changed. She had been caught during a mission, and now her fate was completely in the hands of her supposed target. The ninja looked up from the woman's bounteous bosom into her face. She was looking down the kunoichi, still bearing that superior, amused smile.  
  
"How about a game?", she suddenly asked.   
  
Ayumi frowned. "What kind of game?", she asked in bemusement.  
  
The woman put her sleeve in front of her mouth and chuckled, leading her orbs to jiggle inside her kimono. "Why, can't you guess?", she asked in a mocking tone. "Of course a competition of the biggest tits!"  
  
Ayumi's eyes widened at the suggestion of the lady. "Excuse me?", she asked, sounding more than just a little irritated.  
  
"You hear me right, my little ninja", the woman said. "It's getting a little boring lately to play around with men, you know: Leaning forward to show off my cleavage, pressing my nipples into their backs, making remarks about how you heavy my breasts are � that all can get a little bit monotonous after a while. Another girl with the same gift as me is a welcome distraction! So, what do you think?"  
  
Ayumi blinked. The confusion was written all over her face. She wasn't sure what she should do. She had never really tried to see how big she could get. The largest she ever achieved was around as big as large pumpkins, and it took days before her bust had decreased back to its original size afterwards. The sheer thought of going beyond that was creeping her out. But on the other hand, in this situation, did she really have a choice? As long as that woman was playing with her, she was safe. So Ayumi had to keep her "entertained", or that lunatic might get a reasonable thought like calling the guards. Also, the proud kunoichi was still eager to find a way how she could somehow manage to complete this mission � or at least get out of it alive.   
  
She briefly tried to get up again, but found that she could only lift her breasts a few centimetrs above the ground. And even if she somehow managed to get back on her feet there was no way she would be able to fight or run away. So, as she was left with no other choice, she lowered her body again, wincing slightly as her weight pressed on her bosom, and slowly pulled the hand with the scroll towards her face. Holding it in front of her nose she hesitated a moment. Her gaze immediately met with the two balls of breast flesh as she looked downwards. A large amount of skin was revealed, as well as the tight gap into which each of her mammary spheres were flowing. She could still see the rim of her V-neck and some of the black fabric surrounding her bust, her skin shining slightly through the wide stitches. Sighing she put her other hand on the scroll, her body bobbing on her bosom as her arms didn't hold her up anymore, and closed her eyes. The paper crumpled as she opened the scroll, slowly, but steadily.   
  
Through her closed eye-lids she could see the kanjis glowing. Again the magic was flowing into her, creating a warm feeling in her whole body from her head down to her toes. After a while the warmth concentrated in her chest. As her breasts warmed up the subtle tingle inside them quickly intensified, and it only took a few seconds before the stirring sensation was strong enough to force a gasp out of the kunoichi. She leaned her body a little upwards by pressing her elbows into the floor, putting some pressure from her bosom. A motion was going through the flesh that was piled up between the ground and her body as it slowly spread out again, reaching to all sides and burying the floor around it. The already tight fabric of her suit stretched even further, growing increasingly transparent around her bloating bosom. At the same time the rim of her V-neck glided lower as the girth of her bust expanded, granting growing insight on her bosom as well as on a steadily deeper excerpt of her compressed cleavage. On the sides her breasts began to press against her arms, and while the soft tissue enveloped her elbows they also slightly pushed them aside, weakening the support of her arms. Therefore her bosom had to carry more of Ayumi's weight, causing the growing swells to bulge out faster over the wooden floor. Even though as mass assembled beneath her Ayumi felt as she was bit by bit lifted upwards, her belly getting further away from the ground. She closed the scroll in her hands, panting heavily as her firm bosom pressed with rising force against the floor. While she continued to ascend she took a small glance up towards the woman. She held the sleeve in front of her mouth, but Ayumi could still read the mood on her face: Boredom. She was bored by Ayumi. The ninja gulped, looking down on her massing mammary glands. The growth spurt would lead them to become huge, and the sensitivity was already more than she could handle. Still, after taking in a deep breath that brought the substance of her suit to its absolute limits she opened the scroll again.   
  
Even with all the arousal the kunoichi was scared stiff: activating the scroll again while she was still growing � she had never done something like this before. But she had to keep the woman entertained, and the only way she could do that was by growing her breasts into even more absurd dimensions as they already were. Once more she felt the magic streaming into her body. Slowly she felt as the second spurt was added to the first, upping the already strong sensations in her body. Ayumi panted in long spurts, trying to stay calm. But the pace of her breathing got faster as the tingle in her breasts increased exponentially, growing in dimensions that made it hard for her to even think. The stretching of her suit turned into ripping as the speed of her growth accelerated, carrying her breasts to the scale beyond large pumpkins and into dimensions that could best be described as lampion-sized. On their way there they tore a long tear into each side of her suit, near the place where her arms touched her bosom. The ninja winced as her bare skin graced the fabric of her sleeves, numbing her senses even further. While the tears steadily enlarged both in length and width more holes popped up all around her bosom: A smooth, almost round hole on the top of her right breast, a wide eye-like rip on the lower left slope of her left breast, a vertical rift on the lower middle slightly shifted to the right that showed some cleavage. As her breasts became so big they pushed her roughly two feet up in the air every second another small tear appeared on a random location on her suit, turning it bit by bit into patchwork. Her neckline also didn't just slid deeper anymore, but at the tip of her cleavage the fabric slowly ripped downwards, her breasts breaking the suit as they bulged and tried to squeeze out of it. The piece of her bandana that was hanging from her face got eaten by the rising slopws of her humps, causing more shivers to go through Ayumi as the soft fabric was gliding over her sensitive skin. Though they were squeezed between her body and the ground and therefore had a rather deformed shape one could still see the growing firmness of her breasts as they slowly pushed Ayumi higher, up and up into the air. While the numerous holes in her suit expanded and revealed the shining beauty of her bosom she could clearly feel every vibration inside her breasts, every square of skin rubbing against the fabric of her suit, every little quake in her flesh as her massing meat buns conquered the ground surrounding them. These impulses all added to heights of pleasure she had never experienced in her life before. Normally one would expect such intense sensations to quickly pass after a few seconds, but as the magic of the scroll continued to work on her the sensitivity of her bosom didn't cease to increase, causing her arousal to strengthen accordingly.   
  
In the end it all became too much for the young ninja. Dropping the scroll in her hand she moaned loudly, the bandana only slightly muffling the pleasure in her voice. Her whole body that had practically been paralysed by the sensations the entire time abruptly started to move: Flailing her legs Ayumi's body bobbed on her breasts, the young ninja screaming in artificial delight while she harshly grabbed her meat pillows. Immediately the ripped up fabric broke apart as she clasped her hands around her growing flesh, the feeling of her breasts swelling inside her grip stimulating her even further. Moving her hands from side to side she rubbed her breasts against each other while the more than dubious movements with the rest of her body caused them to repeatedly be squeezed to half their size and then back in their original shape, the process of her actions accelerating the destruction of her suit. Pieces of black fabric fell from the slopes of her breasts until the entire top of her milk jugs was shining in the sparse light of the candle that burned on the table. Both her breasts together were probably heavier than the whole rest of her body, each being bigger than her legs were from knee to foot. Hopping up and down on and massaging her breasts Ayumi barely noticed anything around her, including the woman's amused giggles as she watched her grow. The fabric on the flanks of her bosom seemed like it was preparing for its destruction as steadily more holes popped up in the clothing, the sound of shredding fabric being overturned by Ayumi's hard moans. Slowly the remnants of her suit turned into a spider-net like structure as holes fused and only tense threads still lay intact on her vast curves. While their cover diminished her breasts seemed to spread a little further outwards, though Ayumi's movements made it hard to see the flesh pressing through the gaps.  The more her breasts bulged the more they were shifting upwards, Ayumi not lying on her the center of her breasts anymore but more on their lower slopes. That way the bottom of her bosom that was still covered in a comparably decent manner by black fabric that was stuck between the flesh and the floor, though it was slowly stripped off as her uprising breasts slipped out of the suit.   
  
Despite getting exhausted Ayumi continued to jump on her rack while she aggressevely fondled the swelling masses of her chest. Each drive into her firm flesh drove her arousal a step higher � she could only hope it would reach its climax soon. As the sensations reached their final peak Ayumi's whole body abruptely froze. The flesh of her bosom continued to wobble even as she lay still, pulsating with growth. Paralysed Ayumi held her breath, and for a second her heartbeat stopped. The sparse remnants of her suit broke thread after thread under the growing bulk of her breasts, leaving the ninja's chest practically bare. As their own weight increased Ayumi's body was becoming less of a burden for them, making her rise even higher in the air as they bounced back into a rounder shape. Lying on a pair of meat pillows larger than her body from head to belly Ayumi could feel nothing but her breasts anymore, her breasts and the pleasure they caused as they bursted the fabric, as she felt them swell in her hands, as she was resting on them and getting lifted slowly unpwards by them. When only a few threads on the flanks of her bosom that looked like abandoned spidernets "covered" her the great pleasure inside Ayumi finally began to subside, though she didn't notice it until it had sunken to a level that could actually be experienced by a normal human. When her mind was working normally again she calmly took in a few deep breathes, cautious not to breath in too deeply as she could feel ripple in her assets everytime she inhaled. The last pounds of growth rolled out of her bosom, the tingle inside them decreasing to a subtle prickle - at least subtle compared to before, it was still dangerous for her to just blow air into the direction of her bosom. Much to her shame however Ayumi found herself unable to put her hands off her bosom for the subtle pleasure it granted her, her arms lying around her curves and holding them gently. She actually had to keep herself from stroking herself. Over the sounds of her pants she suddenly heard someone clapping his hands.  
  
"Not bad", the lady complimented her. She took the scroll from her corset, holding it in front of her chest. "Now it's my turn."  
  
With a superior grin she opened the scroll. Again bright light emerged as the magic flowed out of it and into the woman, engulfing her in pleasant warmth. Once the light had faded she put the scroll down, granting Ayumi a free look at her blossoming charms. From the ground the ninja watched her breasts starting to swell again, slowly growing fuller. The already massive mounds once more pressed against the fabric of her kimono, and soon Ayumi could clearly hear it stretch around her flaring curves. The tightness of her cleavage increased, the round walls of her breasts flattening as they squeezed with rising force against each other. At the same time the sides of her kimono slowly slid over the growing slopes of her bust, starting to reveal her more intimidate areas. Resting already smoothly around them the fabric was strained further over the sides of her bosom, its colour getting gradually brighter. Millimeter by millimeter her bust reached forward while bulging into all directions away from her, growing wider than the shoulders of an adult man. The woman put her head back a little as the top of her bosom began to long for her chin, the bottom meanwhile rolling over her last pair of ribs. Fueled by the magic of the scroll her breasts grew out of the dress that confined them, keeping their round and firm shape as they spread evenly to all sides.   
  
To Ayumi it seemed like she was growing even faster than she had just now, her kimono gliding swiftly over the rising form of her bosom. The tip of her cleavage wandered deeper and deeper, the amount of exposed skin extending, and the black fabric grew steadily more transparent on the sides as it stretched around the growing humps, showing all of their firmly formed curves. As her breasts were as big as usual lampions her V-neck reached the end of her bosom, vanishing behind the rim of her red corset. By that point roughly half of the woman's bosom was uncovered: At the bottom the rift in her kimono was around two inches wide, going from there in two arched lines up her bosom as they followed the course of her curves until reaching her shoulders, where the fabric was only a slight notch away from gliding down her arms. Her vast V-neck barely hid her breast warts, the rim of her d�collet� just grazing them and exposing at least a full square of skin and flesh. Though the gap still widened a little as her bosom pulled against it her corset drastically decreased the pace at which the kimono slid over her curves, therefore increasing the pressure on the fabric. Only at the top her V-neck widened at a little faster pace as the fabric glided over the slopes of her breasts. As Ayumi looked from below the lady's bosom began to block the sight on her face, her chin already hidden behind it. The ninja stared at the growing aristocrat with big eyes, the growth still not slowing down despite her hooters being almost as huge as her own. "How can one dose of growth make you so big?", she asked.  
  
Though the lips of the woman began to vanish behind her bust Ayumi could see her smile. "It's all a matter of attitude", she informed her. She moved her hands under her breasts and cupped their undersides, crossing her arms below the large piles of flesh. "The more you want, the more the scroll gives you!"   
  
Ayumi's eyes looked over every inch of the woman's vast bust, basically sucking in all of her curves. "And how come you can still stand with theses?"  
  
The woman giggled. "That's just practice", she replied, winking at the ninja. After she had said that she closed her eyes. Though half of her face was covered by her bust Ayumi knew what the expression on her face looked like, for she knew pretty well from experience what she was feeling: Enjoyment. Pleasure. Stimulation. The woman was enjoying the feeling of her breasts swelling against her palms, was pleased how the fabric stretched under her hands over her bulging bosom, and found stimulation in the small prickles that went through her breasts, making them pulsate with arousal... A soft moan suddenly slipped through the ninja's lips, who found that she was unconsciously rubbing her breasts. Blushing she ceased her caressing, but still couldn't take her hands off her bust. Stupid sensitivity.  
  
Her attention however quickly was drawn back to the woman and her growing breasts. As it stretched around them subtle ripping sounds emerged from the kimono of the lady. Its colour had mainly turned from deep black to an almost transparent grey at the sides of her bosom while the pattern on it was so stretched it could barely be distinguished as cherry petals anymore. Ayumi could clearly hear as the stitches of the dress popped, slowly losing its fight against the massive mammaries inside it. They were still perfectly smooth, round and firm, but suddenly her humps hung a little as the lady leaned forward, just a little. She changed the position of her arms slightly to support her bust. Still, as her balloon continued to blow up her straight posture bit by bit crumbled under the increasing load she had to bear. The flesh of her breasts fully enveloped her chin as it billowed out of her dress, freeing itself steadily from it. Eventually the dress slipped over the woman's shoulders and fell down to her elbows and over her upper back. Immediately the fabric slid over the hills of her bosom and exposed their entire top, the flesh bulging slightly as the pressure was released from it. But her corset kept the tip of her V-neck from moving upwards and therefore the lower part of the rift in her kimono stayed the way it was. The result was the fabric making a strange turn around her breast warts and only covering the bottom left of her left and the bottom right of her right breast, being held by nothing but its tightness. Ayumi's eyes widened again as she could gaze at almost three quarters of the woman's firm bosom. Where it still covered her the fabric was wrapped tautly around the bottom of her breasts, some of it sliding into the gap between them and her chest wall. Of course Ayumi couldn't see this as her breasts blocked the view on everything below her belly, being about to surpass her own jugs in size. And although the woman was leaning an inch further with every inch her bust grew, the clumsy girl was still amazed she was even able to stand like this.  
  
Soft moans began to echoes through the room. Roaring out her lust the woman began to rub her arms a little over her breasts � Ayumi had to hold back not to imitate her. With the pressure of her dress mainly gone the woman's bosom practically pulsated with her pants, bulging forth and back in addition to their constant swelling. What little of her dress still covered her chest was stretched extremely thin, looking as if it was ready to burst any second. As only little kept it from either ripping apart or getting pulled over her breast warts Ayumi saw the growth was slowing down. The creaking of the fabric died off while the movements of her wobbling chest flesh decreased. Still the fabric ripped a little on the right breast, not enough for a tear to appear, but to turn to a sheer layer of clearly visible stitching. The half-naked aristocrat continued to rub her breasts fo a bit longer, gently through her kimono, but as the fabric had thinned to a few millimeters she could feel the sensitivity of her chest clearly throug hit. A louder moan made its way out of her mouth, the woman slightly leaning herself to the side at the pleasurable impulse. As she did though her globes shifted to the side as well, and the woman could feel as they tried to drag them with her. Waking up from her trance she quickly leaned herself to the other side. Her humps followed, bumping slightly into each other and their momentum almost causing her to fall to the other side. As they wobbled left and right neither Ayumi nor the woman herself really noticed as their growth came to an end, settling at a size slightly above Ayumi's. Eventually the lady found her balance again, but still moved a little on the spot with her breasts jittering slightly. Her dress was really close to falling off her round and perky assets that protruded away from her like a pair of giant rubber balls. "So, what do you think?", the lady asked the ninja, smiling amused.  
  
Ayumi looked at the blown-up rack of the lady, inspecting it while the aristocrat staggered on her feet. After a while the ninja sent her own jugs into quivering movements with a shrug. "I guess that's a mildly impressive size, yeah", she said with a completely unimpressed tone in her voice.  
  
The lady raised an eye-brow. "Mildly impressive?", she repeated. After tilting her body int oa position that allowed her to stand still the woman straightened her back. The stitches of her kimono creaked as she stuck her chest out, growing even more transparent around it. "Do you even realise how huge I am?", she asked Ayumi. She removed her hands from her bosom and put them on her hips, though without their support her posture began to falter a little again. "Or was the vastness of my bust too much for your small brain to handle and so it snapped?"  
  
Ayumi made a few small hops on her bust, tilting her head to the side while looking up at what she could still see from the lady's face. "Well, considering how you boasted before, it seems a little... small may not be the right word, but I somehow expected more of someone who claims herself to be the "mistress of the scroll" and the "goddess of bosom". I mean if that's all you can get out of it�"  
  
A hearty laugh interrupted Ayumi. "Oh poor na�ve little girl!" The woman pulled out the scroll from her corset again. "You think this is my maximum size?"  
  
Since it was impossible to hold it in front of her body anymore she simply opened the scroll at her waist. Again the light streamed from the ancient writing. Warmth spread through the woman's body into her bust, the already tremendous sensitivity of her humps causing a boiling heat to build up inside them. The lady shivered slightly as sensations overcame her that seemed to be much even for her. Moans already left her lips before the edged fabric around her breast warts even started to slide over the the rising curves of her bosom. The increasing pressure caused the already strained kimono to creak loudly as the stitches one by one broke apart, the fabric seemingly stretching into nothingness. A low ripping noise at her left breast heralded the doom of the fabric. Slowly a rift began to form on the left underside of her bosom, steadily growing alongside her bust. Another ripping sound emerged from her other breast, the two tears growing synchronously in width and length as her breasts billowed outwards. Looking at them from below the rips appeared to Ayumi like a pair of eyes that was slowly opening and staring at her. As the meat pillows swallowed the face of the lady from her chin upwards and began to roll over her belly Ayumi noticed their weight seemed to trouble her again as she was starting to lean forward. Her breasts were a good notch larger than the ninja's already, sticking several feet out from her body and being far too wide for the woman to reach her arms around them. "So, how is that?", the aristocrat asked confidently.   
  
Ayumi looked at the swelling mounds of flesh. "Can't see a real difference from before", she simply stated.  
  
The woman snorted. She rolled up the scroll in her hand and immediately opened it again. The creaking noise got louder as another surge of magic hit the lady. The "eyes" on the fabric opened at a faster pace as the growth of her burgeoning jugs accelerated. With another load of magic hitting her mammary monsters it felt to the woman like thousands of tiny hands were kneading her bosom, thousands of tiny hands from professional massagers that knew exactly how they had to touch a lady. Her breasts gained inches in seconds, bulging into dimensions that defied all reason. Steadily outshining the ninja's rack her bust began to literally leave her in its shadow, blocking the light of the candle on Ayumi as the diameter of her breasts exceeded the length of the woman from neck to waist. The tip of her hair vanished behind her bosom, so all Ayumi could see of the woman were her legs and her breasts. Soon the tears in her kimono didn't look like eyes anymore but long chasms that went over either side of her breast, while the chasm between her charms gradually lost its tightness since her dress did an increasingly insufficient job at holding her bosom. From behind her wall of flesh Ayumi heard the woman moaning in ecstasy, and as the flanks of her bosom quivered slightly she could tell her arms were shaking as she tried not to grope herself. Further and further the woman leaned forward, her firm and round breasts dragging her towards the ground. Ayumi pulled her head back in reflex as the giant piles of flesh moved into her direction, causing a slight shaking to go through her own bosom. "How's� that?", the woman panted, clearly fighting with the sensitivity and weight of her assets.  
  
Crossing her arms over her cleavage and flailing her legs slowly in the air Ayumi looked at the rapidly growing bust of the woman. "Kind of big", was all she said. "But not really god-like big."  
  
Ayumi got no reply from the woman, except for her pants. Her breasts continued to grow, and Ayumi watched its expansion while slightly bouncing on her chest, still cautious not to give to the urge that told her to grope it. Behind the woman's breast Ayumi then saw a glimmer of light shining for a moment. Behind her quivering breasts the woman let out a loud scream of pleasure, and once it had died off suddenly fell silent again. A quake was going through her breasts as their growth once more picked up, quickly increasing their volume as they flared out to all directions. With a loud rip the remaining cover of her kimono burst apart. The woman threw out a gasp as a swarm of shreds was catapulted from her jolting bosom, some of the pieces falling down on Ayumi. While the ninja closed her eyes and shivered as she felt the ripped up fabric slowly gliding over her curves the breasts of the woman wobbled into all directions; left and right, up and down, forth and back, constantly hitting each other and the rest of her body. Though her kimono had done little at the end to container them her breasts did seem a bit fuller as they danced naked in the air, their smooth curves shining brightly in the light of the candle. The rest of her kimono was still intact, only the part on her chest being destroyed. Dropping the scroll in her hand the woman threw her arms back and slipped out of her sleeves, making the back part of her kimono hang down, only held by her corset. Being completely top-naked the mistress of the monster mammaries struggled to keep her balance, the sensations that were going through her being too strong as that she could have concentrated on anything but her breasts. Eventually however her legs gave in, folding at her knees as they couldn't carry her weight anymore. The massive jugs which together were bigger than her vanity without the mirror slapped against her face from the momentum created as she fell forward, directly towards the grounded ninja. When she landed on her bosom the vibrations the impact created sent Ayumi's own meat into wobbles as well, and both women simultaneously let out a loud gasp as they bobbed on their boobs, the woman of course much more than the kunoichi.   
  
Once Ayumi had calmed down again she saw a giant abyss of cleavage lying directly in front of her face, slowly bulging into her direction. The massive walls of meat wobbled and shook slightly, while it seemed like they were a little moving forth and back with every breath of the woman. The kunoichi pressed her legs into the floor and pulled her body back, moaning from time to time as she dragged her bosom over the ground. While she backed up she saw a rising excerpt of the woman's breasts, though their constant growth at the same time made them steadily slip out of out of Ayumi's sight again. Getting away from the canyon-like gap between her mounds the ninja saw steadily more of the swelling slopes that formed her cleavage, their ascent slowly decreasing the closer they were to the top of her bosom before her hills arched downwards again on the other side. Once she was a few feet away Ayumi could see the woman's bosom in all of its fullness, a pair of stacked meat balls three times wider and more voluminous than her own. On top of them the rest of the lady rested, Ayumi guessing her feet were only barely touching the ground on the other end of her breasts, and her face seemed to have sunken into the sink between them. While she slowly was lifted up by her growing mounds, the swells of her bosom spreading over the ground and into Ayumi's direction, one could hear her moaning weakly, her voice muffled by the flesh around her mouth. Her arms that were hanging over the sides of her breasts, her finger tips just barely reaching past the widest parts of her globes and were gradually moving upwards, slowly began to move. The moans of the woman grew a little louder as she pressed her hands into her firm flesh, the stout mounds showing surprisingly little resistance as the flesh folded around her hands.   
  
Once more Ayumi pulled her breasts over the floor as the woman's bosom almost reached her again, each asset being bigger than the women from head to knee by then, and still expanding at a fast pace. Ayumi's feet eventually hit the wall behind her, the ninja gulping as she realized she was trapped. Luckily, after swelling another few inches and almost reaching the diameter of the woman herself the growth began to slow down. Her unspeakable breasts continued to grow for some longer, but the speed of the expansion steadily dropped until no more swelling could be seen. The woman still moaned with the head between her breasts, digging her her hands as deeply into her round charms as possible. Suddenly she released her grip, causing a small wave to roll over her bosom. Her hands glided up the ascent of her curves, their mistress humming pleasurably as she softly stroked herself.  Looking over her gargantuan bosom Ayumi then watched as the woman raised her head. She looked a bit exhausted, but that expression was overshadowed by the big smile on her face, going almost from ear to ear. "So, what do you think now?", she asked superiorly. A wobble went through her meat as she straightened up on her bosom. "Is that a size worthy the goddess of bosom?"  
  
The ninja looked over the grounded woman, whose breasts each contained more flesh than probably both of them had together in the rest of her bodies. In fact, they were probably still more massive than the two of them even if one counted Ayumi's breasts in. "I do admit, they are pretty� gigantic", she told the woman. A bit unbelieving Ayumi gazed over the vastness of the woman's bosom that seemed to be filling up half the space of the room from wall to wall. "Wow, you are really big!", she finally blurred out in amazement.  
  
The lady chuckled in amusement. "You can say that!", she stated rather proudly.  
  
"So big you probably can't fit through the door, right?", Ayumi asked.  
  
The woman's bosom wobbled as she made a proud hop on them. "You can say that!", she assured the ninja, smiling even brighter.  
  
"So big you can't stand up on your own?"  
  
"You can say that!"  
  
"So big you are completely unable to move?"  
  
"You can say that!"  
  
Swiftly Ayumi pulled a dagger from her belt. "So big you couldn't defend yourself if I crawled over and tried to slice up your throat?", she asked, grinning behind her bandana.  
  
The smile of the lady faded. "Er, I don't think you can say that�"  
  
The next morning the guards found their mistress dead in her chamber, alongside many other guards in the garden. Many questions were raised in the following days: Who was the murderer? How had he gotten into the mansion and killed the guards? Had he acted on his own or was it a hired assassin? In the very moment the guards entered the room however and saw the body of their mistress, only one question struck their minds:  
  
How had she managed to hide those things under her kimono?

Ok best story I've ever read on DA. Not just the boobs but the way it was written was awesome, perfect I would say. But I'm dieing to know what happened to her scroll? Did she take it or will it be a tool for another character? Of course if you intend on continuing I just want to know if she took it, I hate spoilers.

Hahaha, another favourite returns!  
  
Really amusing and nice, nice to see a plotwist about the scroll, along how clever Ayumi acted.  
  
Another nice story once again, also, what happened to the other scroll?

Another good one. Near the end I was wondering if she'd still be able to pull it off.  
  
Kind of a sad waste of an amazing rack, though. Oh well. I'm sure Ayumi can provide plenty~

Basically the rack is still there. And considering how much of it there is it will probably take a while before it starts to, ahem, "shrink"  
  
And yes, she can. And probably will ![;)](./I3reacl_files/wink.gif ";) (Wink)")

Marvellous story sir. Some awesome growth description, and some really good storytelling as well. I honestly was not expecting that little twist at the end. Great stuff.

i find it hard to express my enjoyment in words, so ill say this: it was an absolutely fantastic read. the main source of my enjoyment was not the breast growth, but the clever mind games the ninja used to ultimately end the life of her target. simply classic and simply invigorating. my hat if off to you good sir. keep up the good work

[:iconfaestock:](http://faestock.deviantart.com/) `[faestock](http://faestock.deviantart.com/) is one of our best known and popular deviants from the Stock and Resources community. Her gallery is filled to the brim with high quality stock photographs that have inspired deviants to get creative, and turn the already beautiful images into something magical. Jessica always takes time to reach out to deviants, providing contests and nurturing other artists. We're inspired by her selfless attitude and dedication to a genre that we couldn't create without. It's with great pleasure that we award the Deviousness Award for September 2013 to `[faestock](http://faestock.deviantart.com/), congratulations.  [Read More](http://today.deviantart.com/)

**Dear Dairy**Dear Dairy,  
  
Whoops, typo! But it's kind of funny. Maybe I'll start all my diary entries like that? ;P  
  
Anyway, since quite a few things have happened lately in my life and I don't have anyone right now to talk to (at least yet) I guessed I could start a diary. Of yourse� again a typo, but this one happens actually quite a lot to me ^\_^; Anyway, of yourse it's not like I don't have any friends or a family. Right now, they're all just a few hundred miles away from me. I moved away from home a few days ago for college, and don't know many people here yet. And I'm not really the kind of person who likes to talk all day on the telephone. But](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Dear-Dairy-293882315)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**50k Race**"All bikers to the starting line! I repeat, all bikers to the starting line!"  
  
Hearing the voice of the announcer Gina stretched herself one more time, raising her right hand far above her head while holding the left one on her hip. She tilted her body to the left and spread out her right leg, her blond smooth hair shining brightly in the afternoon sun as it fell to her shoulder. Finishing her warm-up Gina relaxed her pose again. She wiped a strand of hair from her face and tucked it behind her ear, while her blue eyes threw a casual glance at the large church tower clock above her. Only a few minutes before the race would start. She grabbed](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/50k-Race-318394036) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Snow Boobs**It was a late afternoon in December when a young woman was taking a walk through the park. Flakes danced around her nose as she walked over the snow-clad path, smiling at the white scenery around her. The branches of the trees were buckling under the weight of the snow, while the usually lush and green lawn was hidden beneath an at least two inch deep layer of snow. The path the woman was walking on wasn't quite as snowed, but her large winter boots still left deep imprints behind her. While it wasn't pitch-black the lanterns on each side of the path were already shining, their light reflecting in the surrounding snow, and with each minute th](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Snow-Boobs-275240349)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Bikini Body**"Okay, I've added the cat-ears. Now, do you think I'd look better with a bunny nose or a bird beak?" The 22-year old college girl shifted a little on her couch so she could hold her pencil better, while making a few alterations on the semi-anthropomorphic sketch of herself. Between her right shoulder and ear she was holding a telephone from which she impatiently awaited a reply. Meanwhile, the other occupant of the couch looked up at her with a similarly impatient look in her eyes. "I swear I've already fed you twice today, Mitty", she told her begging pet.  All the black cat responded was "meow" before getting up and jumping off th](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Bikini-Body-251846519)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**The genie from the milk bottle 2**There it was, hanging from Amanda's chest: A pair of smooth breasts, shaped into such a perfectly spherical form it looked like someone had molded them in meticulous detail work. Despite the firmness that made them stick out proudly from the body attached to them their flesh gave slightly in to the hands that wandered over them. Softly the tender meat was caressed as the fingers wandered from the fabric on the flanks to the skin revealed in the cleavage, kneading the breasts like a baker his dough. Amanda rubbed her palms over her sensitive mounds, wondering how large they were. Grapefruits? Cantaloupes? It was something in between that was s](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/The-genie-from-the-milk-bottle-2-311517078)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**BE careful what you wish for, part 1**Picking up money as a job sounds better than it is.  
  
Surely it was nice to have his payment earned in the most direct way anyone could imagine, namely by just picking it up. And there had been a time when Heyrn, an Irish leprechaun, really had enjoyed his job: Back in the middle ages when rich aristocrats had ruled over most of the world, especially in Europe, there was more gold to collect than one single leprechaun could possibly spend in his entire life. The nobility in fact was so overwhelmingly rich, each aristocrat could easily afford to throw some golden coins into their private wells each day, just for the fun of it, from where Heyrn](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/BE-careful-what-you-wish-for-part-1-270880615) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**The genie from the milk bottle**There weren't many people who could open a door with their feet, but Amanda was one of them.  
  
Holding the key between her toes the young woman put it into the keyhole, bending a little backwards. She had to be careful nothing would fall out of the box she was carrying in her arms. �That was a good day", she said to herself, looking at all the plastic items, cans and other garbage she had collected. �I can make a lot out of this stuff!"  
  
With little effort she tilted the key around, opening the door. Her apartment looked like one would expect it from a 24-year old woman, maybe a bit larger than the average. The greatest difference be](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/The-genie-from-the-milk-bottle-196457100)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**A Witchy Accident**"Lalala-lala~♪"  
  
The lovely voice of a young lady echoed through the bathroom, filling it with a cheerful melody. Inside a full bathtub the source of the music, a young woman in her early twenties was taking a bath, chirping this little tune while she thoroughly rubbed some foam over her leg. The water pearled off her skin as she stretched her leg into the air, reflecting the light of the ceiling lamp and the full moon that was shining through the window. "Ah, there's nothing like a hot bath", the woman sighed. The tips of her purple hair sunk into the water as she put her head back a little and glided a little deeper into the bathtub.](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/A-Witchy-Accident-272934324) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Wendy's Wish**Wendy looked in awe at her reflection in the mirror. Instead of the small girl she was used to see she looked at the image of a grown-up teenager, being around the same age and height as the other girls in the guild. Her hair, tied with red ribbons into two pigtails was smooth and voluminous, while her face had lost its childish appearance and had taken on a somewhat mysterious, and what was more important very beautiful expression. Her dark blue socks that went up to her knees rested smoothly on her long and sleek legs, a pair of plump and juicy thighs looking out above, barely covered by her pleated grey mini-skirt. Hugging her cute bubble](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Wendy-s-Wish-356926597)

She went to the mall and checked out the department store. Finding clothes for Josie was always easy because of her thin build. She had cute 32b cups breast, and 34" waist. The blonde picked up a few clothes, then got a cute red bra and panties she liked and went into the dressing room.  
As Josie took off her clothes and tried the lingerie, she liked the feel and look the red bra and panties gave her in the mirror, but she noticed some itching on her boobs and ass shortly after putting on the underwear.

**Roslyn the Witch?!** It had been forever long since Roslyn was actually able to simply depart from her daily stresses to stretch her long legs in a long walk. Today, however, she had found the perfect opportunity to do just that. While she was normally busy with her chores or job come Sunday, tonight she sought other interests. Instead, at nine o' clock this Sunday night, she had been freed from her other obligations. Her work at the local craft shop had let her have the day off � without pay, sadly. But there is no such thing as perfect luck �  and the next day was a school holiday county wide. She had been released from her cage!

Sonia clicked the shutter button on her camera, recording the scene before her in its digital memory. Photography was her favorite pastime. To her it wasn't just simply pointing a camera and pressing a button, but a work of art that captures the timeless beauty of an individual into a form that will exist forever. Photos weren't just pictures, but memories. Memories splashed beautifully onto a digital canvas and brightened with a smile. That's what these photos were to her, no matter how simple they would seem to anybody else.

Sabrina and I giggled, "Hi, Brad!"

"It's magical chocolate. You can eat as much as you wish and you'll gain curves only."  
So, when picked up a piece of the statue and ate it. When she swallowed the chocolate, it was the best thing she ever tasted.

Tiffany wanted a reduction, but feared scarring from surgery. So she saw a doctor who promised he could shrink the size of her breast by having the fat and tissue sucked out. After some checking Tiffany arranged for an appointment.

 Lilly wasn't really a snoopy girl. But when she coincidentally witnessed as her mother received a package at the garden gate from the postman, and then went back into the house, acting all secret as if she wanted nobody to see her bringing some package into the house, and when Lilly afterwards spotted her putting a load of red bonbons from the package into a jar that she hid on top of the highest shelf in the kitchen, it was enough to make the short girl move a chair under said shelf, put a pile of books on top of it and step onto the books to reach for the jar.  
  
"Come on", Lilly murmured. She raised herself on the very tips of her toes, stretching her body as far as she could towards the 6'3 high shelf. She shifted slightly as the crate of books flickered on a little. "Come on, just a bit more!", the nineteen-year old whispered. Her fingernails eventually graced the jar that contained the mysterious sweets. Carefully she pulled it forward, more towards her reach, until her small hands could embrace the valuable container. "Yes!", she exclaimed. Smiling she put the jar carefully down the shelf, and pulled it closely to her body. Suddenly the pile of books underneath her feet wobbled. "Whoa!", she screamed as the books slid down the chair like an avalanche. Losing their footing her legs slipped away, leading her to fall in the other direction. Almost simultaneously Lilly and the books landed on either side of the chair, the short girl groaning as her butt made contact with the hard kitchen floor, while the jar with the sweets landed on her belly.  
  
"Owie!" Lilly rubbed the denim fabric of her jeans skirt, caressing her aching backside. "Why did puberty hate me so much?", she sighed. Leaning against the chair she got back on her feet, holding the jar with the sweets in her arm. "Ow ow ow!", she yelped, feeling pain almost everywhere in her body. She put the jar on the chair, and took a look down herself. Luckily she didn't seem to have hurt herself seriously, though she feared she would get some blue marks later. Aside from a knee-long jeans skirt the not really tall girl wore a pair of white tennis socks on her feet with red markings around the toes. On top she wore a pink T-shirt with a white imprint over the small bump in her chest that read "Short and Sweet", the "Short" standing above the "Sweet" and the tiny "and" between them. Around her right hand she wore a wristlet made up of red heart-formed pearls, and a pair of rings with the same pendant hung from her ears. The colour of her skin was more on the light side, though she was not pale, her short smooth hair was light brown, and her eyes sported a green iris with some brown speckles. Between her eyes sat a cute little nose below which was a small mouth with slim lips. All in all her face was rather pretty, looking a bit childish with her round and chubby cheeks. After convincing herself she had only gotten some minor bruises Lilly's attention went back to the jar with the sweets. "Now let's see what's so special about you Mom wants you all for herself!", she said with a grin, and opened the jar. Taking a peek inside she found the little bonbons filled it up to the top, each being not much larger than a pea and glaring red. Lilly moved her hand through the small opening of the jar, and dug it into the pool of sweets. She played a bit with the small red balls, letting them glide through her fingers, before pulling out a single bonbon. Holding it in front of her face she sniffed on it. "Mmm, strawberry!", she chirped. Sticking out her tongue she let the small sweet drop onto it. Her shoulders twitched slightly as she could feel the sweet taste of the bonbon already, before she pulled it alongside her tongue into her mouth.   
  
The corners of her mouth rose to a wide smile as she moved the small bonbon through her mouth, feeling it slowly dissolve. Her taste buds savoured on the most delicious sweetness she had ever experienced. "Mmm!", Lilly hummed in delight. Closing her eyes she rose a little to her tiptoes, moving her hips in slight circles. "Now I know why Mom didn't want to share!", she giggled. The young woman played a bit with the sweet in her mouth, pushing the shrinking ball around with her tongue. Her hand dove back into the jar to pull out some more of this delicious goodness. While she closed her hands around a small load of the red bonbons she didn't feel the loose fabric of her shirt was moving slightly around her chest. The small bump in her top created by her small breasts appeared to be reaching away from her, the cotton getting a teeny bit tenser around the curves of her bosom. Savouring on the taste of the bonbons Lilly didn't notice her chest stuck out further and further from her body, slowly tautening the pink fabric of her T-shirt around them. The contours of her small breasts that could only be guessed through her top became a little bit more apparent, the bulge in her top steadily rising. As they curved out from her body the imprint on the front of her top bend slightly, the edge of the letters becoming rounder just like the little mounds inside Lilly's brassier. Its small cups rubbed over Lilly's skin as her meat buns tried to outgrow it, pressing against its cushioning inside with rising force.   
  
After gulping down the tiny rests of the sweet Lilly threw the load of bonbons in her hand into her mouth. The combined sweetness of all the little red balls made her tongue feel a tingly, the smile on Lilly's face getting wider and brighter. As she began to chew on them and the sweet sticky substance dissolved in her mouth her breasts received a little spurt in their growth. Rounding out from her figure the once subtle bump became gradually more eye-catching, the form of each individual breast slowly showing through her T-shirt. The letters lying over her chest looked like they were growing as well, the ones in the middle faster than those on the sides as her bust's circumference expanded. A slight shade appeared on the underside of her breasts, turning darker the more her vaulting bust blocked the light of the ceiling lamp. With the looseness of her T-shirt shrinking steadily the wrinkles around her chest slowly smoothed as her bosom pressed her brassier against it. The outlines of the cups began to shine through her top while her breasts began to loll out of them beneath it, lapping out on the bottom and the top. Though still far away from being big her bust had gotten at least so far one couldn't "oversee" it anymore. Once they had reached the maximum size in relation to their diameter, sticking out from her like a pair of split tennis balls their widest parts started to ascend from the rest of her chest. A sloping slant formed on the edges of her breasts, giving them a gradually more spherical form as they swelled out from her body while blowing up in width. Occupying ever more space the pink fabric was pulled from around her chest over the bloating slopes of her bosom which reached out to all sides away from her. The bottom steadily moved down over her chest wall, the tops rose towards her neck, and the flanks arched towards her shoulders, all in a very slow, but still noticeable pace.  
  
Noticeable for anyone but Lilly who just stuffed another handful of bonbons into her mouth.   
  
"Sho good!", she moaned with a full mouth. Her cheeks looked like they were about to burst, so many of the sweets were inside them. The smile on her face was so wide it looked silly, fitting the general look on the short girl's face. While she happily ate the sweets the additional "fuel" led the front of her bust to charge forward even faster. Her billowing assets wrapped her T-shirt around their curves, turning the fabric evenly tight around them and making it slightly transparent, especially the stretching "Short and Sweet"-logo. Slowly the hem of her top was rising over the beltline of her skirt towards her belly, and the fabric began to creak as it tried to keep her swelling bust confined. Meanwhile the cups of her small brassier were turning into triangles that lay on top of her mounds, seemingly shrinking around the growing masses of meat. On the edges her bra slightly pressed into her flesh which was, despite the firmness of her orbs, surprisingly tender. Fortunately both the cups and the straps were very flexible, so they didn't demolish the round shape her breasts were growing into. Their inner sides began to rub against each other, at first only slightly, but as the room inside Lilly's top diminished the contact between the swelling walls of her cleavage increased little by little. It was the feeling of her breasts hugging each other more and more tightly that finally got Lilly's attention, making her look down on herself. Where she usually only saw the almost flat board of her chest a pair of small grapefruit-sized spheres blocked her sight further down her body a little, the humbly big bosom lying snuggly inside her suddenly tight T-shirt. Through the brighter fabric of her top she could roughly see the gap between her breasts shining through it as well as the cups and straps of her brassier. Lilly blinked, seeing as her breasts expanded right before her eyes. The bonbons then fell out of her mouth as she dropped her jaw, the little sweets bouncing off from her rack and onto the floor.  
  
While the bonbons rolled over the floor Lilly gaped at her chest in disbelief, watching it grow gradually larger. She could finally also hear the cotton being tautened over her rising breasts, and feel it steadily rise over the lowest of her belly, ascending towards her navel. Putting a hand in front of her mouth she felt her elbow touching the side of her bosom. Lilly blush slightly, thinking that it would usually hung in the air. "M-m-my�", she whispered, looking wide-eyed at her swelling spheres. She didn't really know what she should do. Go to a doctor? Call her mother? Run in circles and scream? Before she could decide however the straps of her bra suddenly snapped below her shoulders, causing the cups to slide down from the front of her bust. Lilly gasped as she felt her bra falling straight to out of her T-shirt to her feet. Her breasts wobbled slightly up and down, causing the pink fabric to creak louder and rub over them. Only slowly they came to a halt, jiggling for a few seconds before resting calmly inside her top again, save for their constant growth. Reaching the diameter of CD's her breasts were about to rip through the fabric, the first stitches already popping. The tightness didn't really hurt Lilly, but it felt a little inconvenient. Though she was quite sure she wasn't dreaming a part of her denied what was happening to her, for the simple impossibility of it.   
  
As the tops of her bosom were almost being on height with her neck the swelling of her assets slowly decreased. Some more flesh was "stuffed" into them for a bit longer, but after growing into what must have been a good double D or E-cup Lilly couldn't detect any more movement in her chest, and could neither hear not feel her T-shirt stretching around her bust anymore. She held her breath, watching her mammaries a while as they rested snuggly inside her pink top. Once more the cotton creaked as she inhaled air for a long breath of relief, the extra-volume in her lungs puffing up her breasts some more before it left them again. Putting her hands around her orbs she cupped the soft piles of meat. Each little move of her fingers caused the cotton to creak slightly, and from time to time she could hear a part of the stitching giving away. Slowly Lilly moved her hands in circles over her breasts as if to check if they were really real. Their form was outstandingly firm and round, Lilly almost believing there was a pair of small rubber balls tucked into her shirt. But she could clearly feel it was her flesh she was stroking, the nerves in her breasts sending pleasant tingles through the teenager's body as her hands explored their new dimensions. She pulled her head back a little, another slight blush forming on her round cheeks. "Where the hell did Mom get those bonbons?", she whispered.  
  
The shirt groaned as her hands softly fondled the mounds inside it. Carefully Lilly moved her fingers over the taut fabric, taking in the warm pleasure erupting from her sensitive meat buns at every stroke. A variety of thoughts went through her head, thoughts triggered by urges and sensations that could be summarized in one single word: More. Opening an eye she glanced towards the jar with the red bonbons. One of her hands left her bosom and slowly reached for the small opening in the jar. It hesitated a moment in front of it, the fingers moving back. But then they shoved right into the jar and pulled out a large amount of the delicious little sweets. "Come to mommy", Lilly whispered, pulling her hand moved towards her mouth. Tilting her head a bit further backwards she was about to drop the cargo into her open maw, when she threw a casual look towards the kitchen door. Immediately her whole body froze in its motion. "M-mommy?", she stuttered.  
  
In the door her mother was standing, holding a full grocery bag in each hand. The middle-aged woman looked quite surprised at her daughter, blinking a few times towards the comically stretched print on the front of her T-shirt. Lilly, standing there with the bonbons in one hand while the other one groped her enhanced bust, felt more blood rushing into her face. She lowered her arms and folded them before her belly, gulping as she waited for some sort of scolding because she had taken the bonbons. Her mother put the bags on the floor, not taking her eyes off from Lilly for a second, and crossed her arms before her chest. "Oh darling", she sighed "That was supposed to be your birthday present!"

I realized I haven�t really done anything new this year, just sequels and fanfictions. Also all my latest works have been rather long and big projects, so I decided to write this little thing for a change.   
  
Aside from that I think the title explains it all. Enjoy ![:)](./I3reacl_files/smile.gif ":) (Smile)")

The only way her mum would buy these is if they were temporary. If they are then you could always do a sequel that takes place in a weeks time. It'd be easy to write a sequel

Its got one of the most attractive characters I've seen created in it. You've also introduced a substance that seems legitimate, an important thing in these stories.

But I've barely described her... it's charming you find her one of the most attractive characters you've ever seen, but that's mostly because of your imagination and not my description XD

This was a really little story. The protagonist was quite cute, and the growth was marvellously described. Great stuff. I hope we can see more of this character and her mother in the future. I'm curious as to where her mum purchased those sweets...

[:iconfaestock:](http://faestock.deviantart.com/) `[faestock](http://faestock.deviantart.com/) is one of our best known and popular deviants from the Stock and Resources community. Her gallery is filled to the brim with high quality stock photographs that have inspired deviants to get creative, and turn the already beautiful images into something magical. Jessica always takes time to reach out to deviants, providing contests and nurturing other artists. We're inspired by her selfless attitude and dedication to a genre that we couldn't create without. It's with great pleasure that we award the Deviousness Award for September 2013 to `[faestock](http://faestock.deviantart.com/), congratulations.  [Read More](http://today.deviantart.com/)

**Bikini Body**"Okay, I've added the cat-ears. Now, do you think I'd look better with a bunny nose or a bird beak?" The 22-year old college girl shifted a little on her couch so she could hold her pencil better, while making a few alterations on the semi-anthropomorphic sketch of herself. Between her right shoulder and ear she was holding a telephone from which she impatiently awaited a reply. Meanwhile, the other occupant of the couch looked up at her with a similarly impatient look in her eyes. "I swear I've already fed you twice today, Mitty", she told her begging pet.  All the black cat responded was "meow" before getting up and jumping off th](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Bikini-Body-251846519)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**A Witchy Accident**"Lalala-lala~♪"  
  
The lovely voice of a young lady echoed through the bathroom, filling it with a cheerful melody. Inside a full bathtub the source of the music, a young woman in her early twenties was taking a bath, chirping this little tune while she thoroughly rubbed some foam over her leg. The water pearled off her skin as she stretched her leg into the air, reflecting the light of the ceiling lamp and the full moon that was shining through the window. "Ah, there's nothing like a hot bath", the woman sighed. The tips of her purple hair sunk into the water as she put her head back a little and glided a little deeper into the bathtub.](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/A-Witchy-Accident-272934324) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**More Milk for More Maidens**"Aren't you done changing yet, April?", Victoria yelled from the kitchen. As her younger co-worker didn't reply she sighed. "Man, first day in our first job, and she can't even get into her uniform." Lowering her green eyes the tall girl looked at the clothes she wore: A short black dress alongside a white apron and matching boots. There was also a white maiden's cap tucked into her short crimson hair. "The chief maiden will be here any moment", she mumbled. "Said something about a "special test" on the phone. And that butler just gave us our uniforms and told us to go straight into the kitchen once we have changed � the rich surely are](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/More-Milk-for-More-Maidens-201845822) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**In retrospect...**Sarah stared into her glass, blushing slightly. With the straw she drew circles on the surface of her juice, nervously shifting around on her chair. �Sooo, how do you feel?", she asked, not looking up from her glass.  
  
�Like a milk-cow", the woman next to her said. Around them, Sarah could hear the whispers of the other guests at the street caf�, constantly glaring over to their table. People passing on the street gazed towards them, their eyes nearly popping out of their heads. �You know, one of those genetically modified with the fat udders."  
  
Silently, Sarah took a sip from her orange juice � coincidentally, &#](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/In-retrospect-202581465)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**BE careful what you wish for, part 1**Picking up money as a job sounds better than it is.  
  
Surely it was nice to have his payment earned in the most direct way anyone could imagine, namely by just picking it up. And there had been a time when Heyrn, an Irish leprechaun, really had enjoyed his job: Back in the middle ages when rich aristocrats had ruled over most of the world, especially in Europe, there was more gold to collect than one single leprechaun could possibly spend in his entire life. The nobility in fact was so overwhelmingly rich, each aristocrat could easily afford to throw some golden coins into their private wells each day, just for the fun of it, from where Heyrn](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/BE-careful-what-you-wish-for-part-1-270880615) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Snow Boobs**It was a late afternoon in December when a young woman was taking a walk through the park. Flakes danced around her nose as she walked over the snow-clad path, smiling at the white scenery around her. The branches of the trees were buckling under the weight of the snow, while the usually lush and green lawn was hidden beneath an at least two inch deep layer of snow. The path the woman was walking on wasn't quite as snowed, but her large winter boots still left deep imprints behind her. While it wasn't pitch-black the lanterns on each side of the path were already shining, their light reflecting in the surrounding snow, and with each minute th](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Snow-Boobs-275240349)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**30k Birthday Celebration**There wasn't really much to associate with the number 30. One of the bloodiest wars in history lasted 30 years, some months have 30 days, and according to Wikipedia there was a band called "30 Odd foot of grunts", but it really isn't a special number. So as Gina turned into the driveway of her home she told herself it was no big deal today was her 30th birthday.  
  
Gina parked in front of her garage, looking at the clock before she shut down the engine. 7pm � it had really been a long day of work. Not that she minded it, she liked her work. And that way, she was able to distract herself a little. Her colleagues had also made it easy for he](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/30k-Birthday-Celebration-268587999)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Tale of the sexy ninja girl**It was a dark night somewhere in the ancient Japan. Carefully, Ayumi peeked out of the small bush she had chosen as her hideout. A few hundred feet ahead of her was the castle she had to infiltrate, the only way inside being a well guarded gate. The young ninja quickly crawled out of the bush, sneaking towards a nearby tree. Before she could hide behind it though she accidentally tripped over one of its roots, and fell onto her face. Cursing at the moonless night she hastily checked if the guards had heard her. Once she was sure nobody had taken notice of her presence Ayumi covered behind the tree, while taking an old paper scroll from her we](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Tale-of-the-sexy-ninja-girl-204211313)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**B(l)Each party I**Buying a bikini can be a quite frustrating, if not even traumatizing experience for young women � especially when they bought it in the same shop as Inoue Orihime and Rangiku Matsumoto.  
  
�What do you think about this one?", Rukia asked, presenting Tatsuki a blue-white striped bikini. The tomboyish girl took a close look at it.  
  
�I dunno", she said after a while. �I think you are more the type for-"  
  
A loud snap suddenly echoed through the store.  
  
�Tatsuki!", a female voice called from the changing cabins. �The knot of my bikini always snaps open!"  
  
Tatsuki, looking slightly annoyed, took in a deep breath. �E](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/B-l-Each-party-I-244888694)

**April's Big Day**April's Big Day  
  
April was cleaning around the house since she was going to have company over today. She had met a woman named Sabrina not very long ago, and had invited her over for lunch. April figured it'd be a good way to get to know more about Sabrina.  
  
Two of April's friends, Clara and Katrina, had introduced her to Sabrina the other day. The cool thing about Clara and Katrina was that they were witches, and could pretty much do anything they wanted; they were also twins.  
  
April had to admit though, that she did have this one thought about kissing Clara; she wondered what it'd be like. Clara was extremely cute and was ve](http://blueberryjanelle.deviantart.com/art/April-s-Big-Day-191673895)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)

Pandora walked down the street casually on a bright sunny day. The sky was blue and there was no cloud in sight. Being on a different planet was a bit different than what she was used to, considering planet Earth was so unique in many ways.  
  
Of course, being an alien princess wasn't easy, either. Pandora had already learned thousands of languages, and every now and then a new alien race would evolve and she would have to learn yet another language. But it didn't really bother her. She was adored by the trillions on her home planet, and everyone loved her.

Ryan smiled down at his fiancee.  He was only 3 inches taller than her, but she was leaning down into his shoulder with her "hug."  "Yeah, I know," he said.  "It does seem like we've been dating forever."  
  
She looked up at him.  "Three years," she said.  "But, next month, it's going to be permanent."

Clara, Kylie, Pandora, and Katrina brought me down to the floor with ease, while Pandora and Kylie pinned my arms to the floor and Clara sat on my belly while she looked down with a giggle, "Hey, there!"  
  
"Here, feed her the bananas!"  
  
Sabrina handed Katrina the four bananas that were left, and unpeeled one. I kept my mouth closed and turned away.

She was really thankful that she had Beth as a friend, she was understanding and could tell her anything. Shyanne trusted her.

Being an alien princess was a lot of work, especially with learning how to speak the thousands of languages throughout the universe. But one thing Pandora really loved about her people, was that all the females of her species could "change" their bodies any way they wanted. It's main purpose was to attract mates, but every now and then she'd have a little fun with her special ability.  
  
Pandora would often visit planet Earth and hang out with some earthlings she called friends. With her skin being leafy green, it was hard to blend in with everyone, though.

 Since she was a child Jean had always loved flying. Though it was over twenty years ago she could still remember the first time when she had entered a plane. She was so nervous she had hold tightly to the arm of her mother the entire time on the airport, and once they sat inside immediately grabbed the leans of her seat. When the plane took off she almost screamed, and couldn't calm down until the signs for the seatbelts had gone off. But as she dared a look outside the window after a while and stared at the sea of white fluffy clouds and the beautiful landscape beneath the plane all her fear was immediately replaced with utter awe. The world below her was looking like a playroom for kids, and all the cities, fields and mountains were toys. Since that moment she loved flying, and even right then as an adult woman looking at the cotton ball-like clouds beneath her brought a smile into Jean's face.  
  
Although it still felt a little awkward not to fly inside a plane, but with the help of hover implants inside her feet and hands.    
  
Spreading her arms from her body Jean floated through the sky, far above the clouds. Invisible flames were emitted through the skin of her hands and feet, keeping her body in the air while making her fly at an incredible fast speed. A part of her left pupil had turned from its natural gray colour to red, displaying various information to Jean at the inside of her eye, from her current altitude and the temperature around to how far away she was from her destination. A small "pop-up" in form of a red arrow informed her she had to change directions. She tilted her left hand a little, flying a small curve until the arrow turned green and disappeared. The distance-meter told her she was 400 km away from her destination, tendency sinking. Jean sighed, feeling as her stomach began to turn � she wasn't really eager to arrive at her destination. A few seconds later the display only read a hundred kilometers, so she began to drop her speed. When the distance fell below a kilometer Jean pulled her legs towards her belly, before moving her body in a straight position. Just as the display hit zero she stopped in mid-air, standing in the sky with all of her hover implants pointing towards the ground. The parameters for speed and distance were replaced with the current air pressure and humidity.   
  
Jean took in a deep breath, wishing she could just turn around and leave this place as fast as possible. Instead however she lowered the power at which her hover implants were working, and in a rather fast pace began to sink towards the ground. The display for altitude was steadily falling while the air pressure rose. Her bare feet soon sunk into the clouds, and shortly after the rest of her body followed. As she moved through the clouds her long azure hair became a little wet, as well as her clothes. She activated the heating system inside her cells, setting her body temperature over a hundred degree Celsius. The water quickly evaporated and mixed as steam into the clouds again, leaving her dry as a bone. Once she was through she could see a small town beneath her. The machines inside her skin cells that had protected her from the low air pressure deactivated as she approached the ground, while her camouflage system activated � people didn't need to know a gynoid was about to land in their neighborhood. The fields and forests around the town faded out of her sight as Jean sunk lower, heading for a specific house.  
  
An inch above the ground she deactivated her hover implants, softly landing on the lawn of a small house. Her left eye turned grey again as Jean shut off the display, while at the same time she reactivated her temperature nerves. A sudden heat wave quickly reminded her to deactivate the heating system as well, while at the same time she decreased the sensitivity of her pain nerves. "I hope the professor has an upgrade for my temperature systems today", she mumbled before switching off her camouflage and setting all systems back to standard. Like any normal person (putting aside she wore no shoes) Jean walked over to the house, the grass tickling her bare feet a little. Instead of going to the front door however she marched straight to the cellar door a few feet next to it.   
  
A small scanner was built into the wall next to the entrance. Jean first put her hand on it, waiting for the machine to identify her finger prints, before holding her face in front of the screen so it could analyse her facial structure. "ACCESS DENIED", a robotic voice told her. Putting her hands on her hips Jean glared at the machine. She tried two more times, but the result was the same. "Very funny, professor", Jean murmured, knowing how he wanted her to get in. She took a look around to make sure nobody watched her. Even as she activated her X-ray vision she couldn't see anyone, but decided to double-checked scanning the environment for life-forms. No driving car in a hundred meter radius, no curious neighbors around, only a squirrel was sitting on a tree behind her. Again Jean sighed before she positioned herself in front of the house. She bent down to her knees, grabbing the bottom of the wall.   
  
The whole house shook and trembled, some rubber falling off as Jean slowly lifted it into the air. Her face didn't show any signs of effort as she raised the whole building above her head, cautious that the furniture inside wouldn't slide out of place. Below her she could see the staircase to the basement � and the entire basement � right behind the door that wouldn't let her in. Activating the hover implants in her feet she set off a little from the ground, lifting the house even higher into the air, and placed herself above the stairs. She moved the house a little to the side so it would be at the same place as before, before she began to sink down again. There was nearly no sound as the house landed back on the ground, putting everything around Jean into complete darkness since there was no light in the staircase. With her night vision she could see the door at the end of the stairs was right open. She dropped herself to the ground, took in another deep breath, and then finally walked through the door into the basement.  
  
Inside one could have thought be in a horror movie from the early 20th century. The place was crowded with weird machines, some larger than an elephant, others tiny and fragile. Test tubes were standing on the numerous tables scattered throughout the cramped laboratory, while cupboards filled with blueprints and more machines formed a maze most people would forever get lost inside. From time to time a lightning went from one machine to another, and some of the colourful chemicals inside the test tubes boiled and blubbered even though they were not heated by anything. "Professor?", Jean called into the room. "Professor, are you here?" She was about to activate her X-ray vision again when she heard some noise coming from the back of the room. Behind a cupboard filled with god-knew-what a middle-aged man in a laboratory coat appeared. His short brown hair was a little messy, and he seemed to be in desperate need for a shave.   
  
"Ah, Jean", he greeted the gynoid, smiling as he cleaned his oil-drenched hands with a handkerchief. "Welcome to my little realm! Came for an upgrade, huh?"  
  
Jean smiled back, though only out of politeness. "Yep!", she replied, taking a step into the laboratory. "Today it's only software, right?"  
  
The professor nodded. "Just fixing a few minor bugs and updating some programs."    
  
 "Ah, great!", she said with faked joy. "I have to watch YouTube videos on my PC at home because the flash player in my system isn't up to date. By the way can't you just make it so I'm able to download such stuff myself?", she asked a bit hopeful.  
  
"It's possible, but it would make you vulnerable to viruses and hackers", he answered, smashing all of Jean's hopes to spare herself at least some trips to this place. "And I doubt you want anyone to mess with your body � anyone but me, of course." The smile on the professor's face crept Jean out. She followed him to the back of the laboratory, past numerous cupboards and tables filled with gadgets and chemicals. Some of the machines Jean already knew or could at least roughly guess what they were meant for, while others were completely alien to her. While she stared at the science surrounding her Jean almost bumped into the professor as he suddenly stopped. "If you are interested though", he said with a smirk "I also have a new piece of hardware for you."  
  
Jean crossed her arms before her chest. "Oh great, just what I need", she said, dropping all of her fake friendliness. "Another piece of metal junk inside my body."  
  
The professor grunted. "You know that without this metal junk, you would be lying six feet deep under the earth right now", he reminded her. "A little bit more gratitude would be appropriate, don't you think?"  
  
Jean rolled her eyes. "Oh yeah, you are really generous to have transformed my body into a biomechanical sci-fi-monstrosity", she said sarcastically. "And I can't thank you enough for forcing me into a contract that makes me your personal guinea pig for the rest of my life!"   
  
"Come on, one experiment per month is a fair price for saving your life!"  
  
Jean turned around, showing her back to the professor. "I wonder", she mumbled, more to herself than to him. "Sometimes I wish to have just died back then. I know I'm practically a super-woman with a virtually indestructible body that won't age or get sick, and I can't deny a part of me likes it, but�" Jean looked at her hands. They seemed completely normal, like those of any other person. Still, she knew beneath the artificial skin there were hover implants, titan-joints, a musculature made out of biomechanical tissue and whatever other stuff the professor had put into them. "My own body feels completely alien to me! I'm more a machine than a human! I� I�" She clenched her fists. "I feel like a total freak! A monster!"  
  
The professor shook his head. "Now calm down", he said, sounding as monotone and disinterested as the card-reader. "It's not like you are the only gynoid in the world."  
  
"Yeah, cause five is such a high number", she said, turning around again. "Practically run into one every day."  
  
Again the professor smiled. "Well, since you can travel at over a hundred kilometer per second it would be no problem." The way Jean glared at him however told the professor she was not amused, so he quickly changed the topic. "But seriously, I actually don't have any new components for you. I just want to test out a new formula."  
  
"Then what was that about the hardware?", Jean asked. She could see the professor was holding back another grin.  
  
"You'll see once we get started. So?"  
  
Knowing the professor Jean had a very bad feeling about this. Then again, she was forced to "assist" him in at least one experiment per month, or else she would get into trouble with the law. And she remembered very well the last time when the end of the month had come and he had no experiment for her � and what he eventually came up with�  
  
"All right", she sighed, already regretting her decision. "Go ahead and put your poison into me."  
  
The professor couldn't hold back his smile anymore, showing he also needed to brush his teeth. He gestured with his hand towards a metal table that looked like Frankenstein had used it or his monster. "Sit down", he told her. "You know the procedure." All too well, Jean thought as she sat on the table. Next to her a black short-sleeved top was lying, looking like it was made out of rubber. "All right, take off your shirt and put this on", the professor said while walking over to one of his machines. Jean clenched her teeth, but pulled her top over her head to reveal her slender waist and a white sports bra. She grabbed the shirt, finding it also felt like rubber (though she was quite confident it wasn't) and began to slip into the sleeves. "Bra off, too!", the professor called over. Jean stopped, throwing an angry glance at him. "Come on, it's not like I haven't seen you naked before! I even have pictures lying around somewhere."  
  
At first Jean didn't react. Looking sternly at the professor she put the shirt back down, before placing her hands behind her back. With a small click the lock of her brassier opened, falling on her lap to reveal a pair of tiny, nearly invisible breasts. Without a word she slipped into the "rubber"-shirt, ignoring the lecherous stares of the professor. "Watch out or your eyes will pop out", she warned him while pulling the fabric past her belly. The top was lying almost skin-tight on her body, showing all of the few curves she possessed. She noticed there were a few holes in the fabric, right at her waist. "You really are exploiting your position, aren't you?"  
  
After looking at Jean in her extremely tight top for a while the professor walked over to her side. "Don't complain to me that androids have fewer rights than normal humans", he told her. "But yeah, I am." As Jean lay down on the table the professor pulled out some wires and hoses from beneath it. While he sorted them in his hands Jean lifted her head a little to see where they were going. The wires seemed to be connected to the machine the professor had been working on before, while the hoses ended at several large glass tubes at the wall. They must have contained at least twenty liters of different coloured chemicals inside them, from boiling red chemicals to blue blubbering ones � and Jean had no doubt they all would soon be inside her body. "You think there is even enough space inside me for this?", Jean joked.   
  
The professor chuckled.   
  
Jean then felt as he held the wires at her neck. As the metal tips touched her skin a few holes automatically appeared inside it, into which the professor stuck the wires. After she was connected to the machine he attached the hoses in a similar way through the holes in her shirt, where they also automatically connected to her body. Once everything was in place the professor went back to the computer desk at the machine. "So what is it today?", Jean asked as the professor typed something into his keyboard. "Some new medicine that's too dangerous to try out on normal humans? A hormone therapy? A love potion?" Jean glanced at the professor. Never had she seen him grinning that much before.   
  
"A mixture of all, if you like", he replied. "It's a surprise." Jean hated surprises, especially those of the professor � the last one had turned her hair blue. While the professor typed into his machine Jean tapped with her fingers on the metal plate, feeling as sweat formed on her forehead. "All right", she could finally hear the professor say "Here we go!"   
  
A small electric pulse went through Jean. Staring at the ceiling she could hear some weird noises as the tubes started pumping the liquids through the hoses. A few seconds later the chemicals flowed into her body. Her biomechanical heart was racing as they worked their way into her veins, making her waggle uncomfortably on the table. Already wishing never to have agreed to this she wanted to shut down all her systems and fall into a temporary stasis. But to her shock she found that most of her functions were locked, leaving her with barely any control over herself.   
  
"Sorry", the professor said, noticing Jean's efforts. "But for this experiment you need to be at full conscience, so I blocked your systems." Jean wanted to say something, but the words got stuck in her throat. A numb feeling settled into her body, making it tingle all over. Closing her eyes she put her head back, breathing through her mouth as if she didn't get enough air. "Metabolism stable", she could hear the professor talk to himself. "A bit too stable - she should be in a way worse shape. Double the dosage!" At her side Jean felt as the liquids flowed faster into her, strengthening the prickle in her body. Feeling ever more uncomfortable she arched her back, pressing her shoulders into the table. "Flow of blood accelerates, higher amounts of adrenaline are thrown out, body temperature rising � now that's more like it! Next, I'll inject the formula."   
  
Turning her head Jean realized one of the hoses was still empty. The professor pulled a small lever, sending a purple liquid sloshing towards Jean. The moment it entered her body she immediately felt a small burn in her side. The feeling grew stronger, heating her whole body up until she felt like she was taking a hot bath � a slightly too hot bath. "H-hey, professor!", she shouted with shaking voice. "C-can I at least d-deactivate my t-t-temperature n-nerves?"  
  
"No dice. Now get ready, it's about to start."  
  
Before Jean could ask what was starting a strong sensation went through her body. Cringing in pain she could feel the tingle was intensifying in her chest, as if all the chemicals were mixing together inside it. She leaned her head slightly forward, as far as she could, and closely watched for any kind of changes on her chest. The rubbery fabric was lying mainly flat on her torso, only bulging slightly from her small breasts. The sensation grew stronger, but she couldn't detect anything weird yet. She wanted to scan herself to find out what was happening to her, but even that function was blocked. As she stared at her tingling chest, wondering what the professor had prepared for her this time, her usually flat nipples suddenly poked through her shirt. Jean blinked, watching as her breast-warts grew into small peaks. Before her very eyes then the tiny breasts inside her shirt suddenly began to rise up, swelling like a giant bee had stung her. "W- what�?", she stuttered. Wide-eyed she watched as the flesh around her breast-warts slowly ascended, sprouting from her torso like small plants. "What the�?!" Steadily her feminine curves spread out from her chest, growing into small humps. "W-WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME?", she finally screamed.   
  
The professor busily typed around on his machine, occasionally throwing a glance at Jean's blooming bust. "What does it look like?", he asked back in a monotone voice. "I'm making your tits bigger."  
  
Staring at her breasts in shock Jean watched as they pressed a growing dent into the already tight fabric. "Why?!", she screamed. Through the sound of stretching rubber Jean could hear the professor chuckle.   
  
"Well that's funny. By now I have replaced your blood cells with nanobots, implanted electronic wires into your skin, messed around with pretty much all of your inner organs and forced you into some very embarrassing psychological experiments, but you never asked me why." Jean's breathing was getting faster, her swelling chest going up and down in fast spurts. "But if you've gotta know: This purple liquid is a formula that stimulates biomechanical hormone glands and forces them to work at 500% of their normal capacity� or 5000, don't have the exact numbers in my head. And just now, I stimulated the glands that are responsible for the growth of your breasts."  
  
While her breasts conquered her previously plain chest the tingle inside them was growing stronger the more they pressed against her top. "W-why my breasts?!?", she asked hysterically. "Why can't you test it on my adrenaline glands or something else?"  
  
"Cause I'm a sick man who sleeps with a Playboy under his pillow", the professor simply said.   
  
Jean wanted to stand up and slap him across the face, but like her technical systems she couldn't control her legs and arms � she hadn't expected anything else, but it was worth the try. Meanwhile her bosom was rising like bread in an oven, tingling like her shirt was stuffed with feathers. At first the middle of her breasts was rising faster than the rest, giving them a slight cone-shape, but as time passed they gradually smoothed towards a round, hemi-spherical form. "Y-you have some kind of antidote for this?", Jean asked.  
  
"That'll probably be the experiment next month", the professor replied. "Now concentrate, you'll have to fill out a questionnaire afterwards."  
  
Jean had a ton of more things to say, most of them not suitable for minors. But the bigger her breasts became the less she found herself able to speak, until she could only bring out some dry coughs. Small prickles went through her biomechanical nerves as the fabric of her shirt stretched around her bulging chest. Her limbs were twitching as far as her paralysis allowed it, the sensation inside her growing stronger the smaller the gap between her breasts became. It felt like the tissue inside her breasts not only stretched her shirt but also the skin around them, making them more and more sensitive to every touch. Jean took in a deep breath, trying to breathe normally as she didn't want to show her arousal to the professor. On top of her swelling humps however she could feel as her small nipples grew a little thicker, standing proudly from her body.   
  
"Looks like you're enjoying it", the professor remarked. Jean imagined him grinning from ear to ear, but was too "occupied" to glare at him. Sporting two fistfuls of breast flesh a chill went through her as the distance between her breasts shrunk to zero, making them slightly press against each other. While she fought down the sensations inside them her breasts shaped into a pair of small domes, pointing round and firm towards the ceiling. Their widest parts ascended from her torso as they flared over the sides of her body, gradually growing into full spheres. Jean was glad the fabric of her shirt seemed to be just as elastic as it looked like, allowing her to keep at least a shred of decency in this disgraceful situation. But although the rubber loudly stretched around her ballooning bust the space inside it was getting very small very quickly. Her assets squeezed against each other with growing force, increasing the prickles inside them. Feeling restless Jean wiggled with all body parts she was able to move on the table. She could feel every additional ounce of flesh inside her shirt as the fabric rubbed against her sensitive skin, making her nipples grow even harder.   
  
Reaching the size of ripe oranges her breasts extended the hole for the head in her shirt, slowly pulling it towards her chest. The black fabric turned a little transparent as it thinned around her bosom, her areola starting to shine through. With more control over her body Jean would have probably waggled on the table like a fish outside of the water, but the most she could do right then was shake her belly a little. Her breasts responded to her movements, bouncing slightly from side to side. The space inside her shirt was cramped and narrow, but there was still enough room left for her breasts to bump against each other, each small impact sending a pulse of pleasure through Jean. The gynoid looked like she was about to jump up from the table, while her nipples poked painfully erected through her top.   
  
"You're getting quite excited", she could hear the professor say. "Hm... We could do a little psychological experiment as well. Let's see what happens if I give you back the control over your arms." 'I'll break your nose wit them!', she wanted to yell at him, her breasts puffing to the size of grapefruits as the professor typed a few commands into his machines. A petite neckline was forming on top of her shirt, while at the same time the fabric began to slide over her belly, revealing a rising midriff. Her trembling arms suddenly moved wildly through the air as the stiff feeling that paralysed them vanished. Realising she had regained control over them Jean immediately spread her arms out from as far as she could, trying to stay calm. As her bosom reached further away from her however, boosting into lusciously larger and firmer forms, her arms slowly began to buckle towards them. Shaking as if she was about to freeze her hands slowly approached her rising breasts, while her fingers formed two cups in preparation to grope them. Jean panted heavily, and closed her eyes. Through the stretching fabric her light skin was slightly visible, her breasts reaching the diameter of CDs on their widest parts. Her head hole steadily moved up her bosom, revealing a growing amount of cleavage, while her shirt got pulled over her belly-button. Her hands were hovering only a few centimeters above her chest, the distance steadily decreasing as her arms sunk lower and her chest rose higher. Unable to resist any longer Jean gulped before poking the taut fabric with the tips of her fingers.   
  
A soft moan echoed through the laboratory. Jean's whole body leaned up a little as waves of pleasure went through her, making her feel strangely relaxed all of a sudden. Carefully she let her hands fall on her chest, until they fully embraced her firm meat buns. Another moan slipped through her lips as she felt them swelling against her palms, growing so large they slumped down a little. Getting ever more to grab Jean's hands slightly pressed into her curvaceous flesh, stimulating her electronic nerves. Her legs shook violently, begging to break free of their stasis, but the only thing Jean could do was fasten the grip on her breasts. She wrapped the fabric around her fingers, stretching it further around her mammal melons. With clenched teeth she took in a deep breath, before her mouth broke open as she let out a long, sensual sigh. Her sounds of lust overturned the rubber as it ripped on top of her bosom, deepening the hole in her shirt and her small line of cleavage.   
  
Tearing on her top her breasts grew to the size of her head, standing as two full lumps of meat from her body. Her bust was growing wider than her hips, being probably even visible from behind, while her breast warts were almost a foot away from the rest of her body. The top of her bosom reached to her neck, while the bottom arrived at her last rip. On each side the shape of her breasts was nearly perfectly curvy and stout, only her cleavage looking a little squeezed as there was only little room inside her tight top. Her shirt looked like it could explode any second, turning from black to gray due to the immense pressure. While the rift in her shirt steadily became deeper, her cleavage growing through the length of her fingers, Jean's hands softly fondled her bosom, luring moan after moan out of the gynoid. She tried to hold herself back, but the pleasure was so intense that she couldn't bring herself to stop. Two oval holes appeared on each side of her shirt as the tense fabric ripped there as well, allowing a small look at the edges of her firm curves. Being slightly released from their pressure her breasts jolted a bit forward, making small bounces into every direction. The outbreak made the rift in her head hole go up an inch higher, giving a generous insight to her cleavage. Bit by bit her swelling bosom stretched the tears in her shirt, leaving steadily more of feminine charms without cover. Her rising sweater meat was not the only thing that put the fabric under pressure though as Jean's groping also helped to reduce her top into nothingness. Every time she dug her hands into her firm flesh she felt her arousal shooting up a bit higher, which led her nipples to grow thicker and longer at each arousing impulse.   
  
With a loud rip her breast warts tore two more holes into her shirt, standing like pink thimbles on top of her breasts. Slowly the fabric around her nipples slid over her areola, before wandering over her falling curves. Blooming to the size of big volley balls her breasts stretched the skin-tight fabric to the limit, pulling the shirt over her belly. Its short sleeves had been dragged over her shoulders as her breasts were almost consuming all the fabric. The holes around her nipples quickly got larger, growing from little golf holes to the size of CDs in a few seconds. Meanwhile the oval tears on the sides were also stretched around her rising bust, being roughly as big as Jean's hands. While her front cleavage had ripped through a third of her shirt, showing a wide and tight V-neck full of breast flesh, her shirt began to rise over her bosom, creating a firm under cleavage. Her top was near the point at which it showed more of her breasts than it could cover, but her last shreds of self-control allowed Jean to only grope herself at the regions where the fabric was still lying on her sensitive globes, though those "save places" were steadily shrinking. The best of course would have been if she had stopped fondling her bosom all together, but no matter how hard she tried she just couldn't resist the urge to press her fingers into her firm flesh, sending wave after wave of pleasure through her mind. Her intense caressing led her orbs to jiggle a little as they gave in a little to her hands, pressing them into a slight egg-shape. It was almost absurd how solid her basket-ball-sized breasts still stood from her body, her thumb-sized nipples pointing directly at the ceiling.   
  
Her massive piles of meat suddenly flared into every direction, mainly to the front as the holes her nipples had created united, granting a generous view on the front of her bosom. Jean stopped her caressing for a moment, her breasts jiggling like two giants puddings inside her hands. A moment later and her V-neck also reached the hole, allowing masses of breast flesh to press through the giant cleavage that was forged by the unison of the tears. The holes on the sides had ripped over the widest parts of her curves, making her shirt look like a way too small bikini top. While her growing mounds continued to destroy the fragments of her top, her bounteous bosom pouring through the rifts, Jean's hands had almost no fabric left to rest on. Her vast under cleavage was already showing more than a third of her bust, the fabric slowly sliding up the ascent of her bust. Jean panted hard and fast, throwing out a weak moan from time to time. Suddenly the thin fabric on the sides of her bosom � the "holders of her bikini" � snapped at her shoulders, moving her bust line forward as her cleavage fused with the rifts on the sides. Jean pulled her head back a little as her breasts pushed against her chin, wobbling forth and back while tearing on the remnants of her shirt. Like a belt the fabric was lying tightly around her bosom, resting only slightly below her nipples. Through the whole laboratory the rubber's desperate struggle could be heard as it stretched around her still growing breasts, getting ripped apart bit by bit. Though she was doing her best to keep her hands off her skin Jean felt the fabric slipping off beneath her palms, forcing her into direct contact with her sensitive bosom. Her whole body quivered in arousal, the trembling of her hands shaking her bosom. With a loud rip the "top" finally broke apart, blowing away like a broken rubber band. Her bare breasts shook and trembled, wobbling into every direction as they had broken through all constrictions.   
  
"Guess I need to work on this super-elastic material some more before I can sell it to the military", the professor mumbled. Having jumped up to the size of medicine balls her breasts pushed against her arms, while her hands were still pressing deeply into her firm flesh. With an open mouth Jean swallowed, holding her breath for a moment. Unhindered her breasts reached out to all sides, outgrowing any reasonable measurements. She crooked her fingers to dig them into the swelling masses, pressing her arms as deeply into them as she could. All the pleasure that had built up inside her was released as she began to rub her bosom with all her might, her flesh wobbling wildly between her arms. Her breath returned, louder and faster than before, her pants quickly filling with pleasure until she only threw out one moan after another. As the last drops of the purple liquid flowed into her Jean rocked her body forth and back on the table as much as she could while moaning in ecstasy.   
  
With a wide grin the professor pushed a button, therefore ending the paralysis. The wires and hoses attached to Jean were ripped out as she rolled to the side, falling right off the table. She almost screamed her lunges out as she hit the cold ground of the basement with her ballooning bosom, and interrupted her massage for a second. But as her firm flesh pressed against the ground and her long blue hair fell over shoulder into her cleavage, tickling her sensitive skin, she quickly began to fondle herself again. Her hard nipples pressed against the ground, hurting Jean a little as they were buried under her swelling bosom. She barely noticed it however through all the pleasant impulses that were sent through her nerves. Putting her head back (because her cleavage was about to eat it) Jean put even more strength into her gropes, pressing her breasts against each other. Her body hopped on her bosom as she kneaded the firm flesh with her hands, sending big bounces through her bust. While Jean felt like she was floating towards heaven her bosom flowed out to all sides, against her arms, the rest of her body and the ground, lifting her a little into the air.   
  
Slowly then, the urges inside Jean subsided. Her moans steadily lost their insensitivity, and her groping became tamer. At a monumental size at which even big beach balls would be close before bursting she could feel no more flesh pouring against her arms, except for the one that was already there. Panting and sweating Jean collapsed on her bust, hopping around on it while she let her arms hang down. Her body was pressing her breasts against the ground, but it only squeezed them into a slightly oval shape, their firmness still apparent. As she pulled her hair out of her cleavage and tucked it behind her ears Jean let out a long sigh, blowing the air against her bosom. Her chin was completely hidden between her breasts, and she could feel some of her mammal meat brushing against her cheeks and lips. "Oh. My. GOD!", Jean brought out in exhaustion. After she had relaxed a little she added: "And I bet you have filmed everything, didn't you?"  
  
With a creepy smile on his face the professor worked on his computer, obviously content with the result of the test. "Visual recordings are necessary for every big experiment", he informed his guinea pig. "And I've already got offers from four large pornography concerns for the video material. Somehow I need to finance my researches, after all. "  
  
Jean groaned. Each of her breaths was making her body move up and down with, reminding her she should get back on her feet.  She tried to move her arms past her monstrous bust to push herself up, but no matter hard she pressed and how much flesh spilled against her face, she could only reach the ground with her fingertips. Plus, as her arms pressed against her breasts, her sensitive orbs sent sensual impulses through her nerves again, making her a little shaky in the legs. "I can lift up an entire house, but am unable to get back on my feet", she mumbled in anger while pulling her arms back. Pressing her knees against the ground she knew she had no choice but to lift herself up only with the force of her back muscles. Since she had the control over her systems again she pumped all her strength into her back musculature, her breasts blowing up a little as she took in a deep breath before she started to heave her bosom. The pressure on her breasts slowly decreased as she straightened her upper-body, slowly sitting up. Her breasts pushed back into a rounder shape, while Jean felt the pressure on her breast warts was decreasing. She had to overload some of her muscles, but she was eventually able to lift her breasts into the air, making her giant melons hang proudly from her body. Carefully then she tried to stand up. After fighting with her balance a bit she managed to get fully back on her feet, although she had to lean slightly forward. "How come my breasts feel so heavy?", Jean asked, rowing with her arms not to fall over. "I mean I have the strength of a hundred men!"  
  
"A thousand", the professor corrected her. "And it's because the gravity center of your body has changed."   
  
As if on cue a window suddenly appeared in Alice sight. "CENTER OF GRAVITY CHANGED. RECALIBRATE?" With a single thought Jean agreed. Inside her she felt as the structure of her biomechanical muscles and cells was changing, adjusting to the new set of melons on her chest. Slowly the weight of her bosom felt less heavy, allowing Jean to straighten her back more and more. After a few seconds she was standing perfectly straight, and it felt like there was no weight on her chest at all. Trying to ignore her swollen assets however was still impossible: First, they were still very sensitive, reacting to every small move of her with a tingle. Second, even as she was standing their firmness and roundness could only be described as simply stunning. She couldn't reach to her nipples with her arms, but her bosom still didn't stand any lower than to her thighs. The top of her breasts meanwhile was always in her sight unless she looked up at the ceiling, her cleavage brushing against her chin every time she took in a deep breath or just lowered her head. "Was it really necessary to go that far to test your weird formula? Don't answer", she quickly added as another grin spread over the professor's face. She put her arms around her humongous bust as far as she could, squeezing her firm flesh a little. "Are� are they real?", she asked after a while. "I mean are they all flesh and skin, or just more biomechanical bullshit?"  
  
The professor's gaze went back from Jean's charms to the screen of his machine. "I can assure you they are 100% natural. The liquids I first poured into you contained organic molecules that served as resources for your growth, so there are no technical modifications of any kind. Even the skin is completely unaltered. Go ahead: Try to control the nerves in your tits."  
  
Jean removed her arms from her bosom. Her breasts were still tingling a little, so she first tried to deactivate their sensitivity. The electric impulse went to regions around her breasts, making her numb to any feeling there, but not any further. Jean was surprised. Next she tried to manipulate the muscles in them. Her breasts jiggled slightly as her abs flexed and her arms bulged a little, but otherwise Jean couldn't detect any changes. One by one she tried out all functions that could affect them, from heat sensory to colour change. While all body parts responded to her thoughts her breasts always remained the same firm round mounds they were, only wobbling a little at some commands. As she looked at the giant humps on her chest with big eyes a weird feeling of joy was overcoming her. "Wow", Jean could only say as she put her systems back to normal. After staring silently at her breasts for a while she put her arms back around them. The tingle increased as she gently she rubbed her hands over her skin, while she began to cuddle her cleavage with her face. "They are all me�", she whispered with a smile.  
  
The professor had also been smiling as he watched Jean, raising his voice after a while: "Okay, so about shrinking them back: I'm working on a new kind of laser that can evaporate an entire cement block in less than a-"  
  
"Forget it! I won't let you ever lay a single finger on them again!"  
  
The professor raised an eye-brow.  
  
"You've heard me right! You can think of me what you want, but I will keep them." She pulled her arms tighter around her breasts, closing her eyes as she hugged her meat balls. "Since the accident I have always felt like a stranger inside my own body. It's not enough everybody stares at me like I'm an alien, but often I feel myself like I'm one, like someone who doesn't belong into this world. But now, for the first time in years, there is something on me that I can not control like a computer, that is not more a part of a machine than a human body. Finally, I can feel again like I'm a� a human!"  
  
The professor had still fun watching Jean, although her behaviour was startling him a little. "Just to be sure: You are aware you've got more human in your tits than most people in their entire body?"  
  
Jean let go of her breasts, pulling her head out of her cleavage as it started bouncing. "Fine", she said with a big grin on her face. "If you prefer a flat-chested girl to fly into your lab every month instead of the bustiest woman in the world�"  
  
"Good point. All right, I'll just grow some other part of your body next month and test the laser on it."   
  
Another wobble went through Jean's chest as she began to shudder. "Can't wait for it", she murmured.

Every year between the ages of ten and eighteen, I sent a letter to NASA.

**Mammary Mentality**�Doctor, I�m obsessed with boobs!�  
  
Through her rectangular glasses Quinn looked up from her notepad to the man lying on the red couch in front of her. Sitting on her office chair her legs were crossed, partly out of habit, partly so her patient couldn�t peek under her knee-long grey skirt that lay tightly around her thighs and hips. Dark nylon thighs covered her smooth legs, and she wore black high-heels on her small feet. �It is true that during our little sessions you have revealed several aspects of your personality hold a particular interest in the exclusive charm of a woman�s body, especially when the](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Mammary-Mentality-337778591)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**True love only grows I**Tap. Tap. Tap.  
  
Again and again a foot was stepping on the ground. In a simple rhythm Britney tapped on the carpet of her husband�s office. From time to time a small click accompanied the tapping as Britney was biting on the nail of her thumb her teeth, chopping off small pieces in an irregular pattern. The bitter taste of the red nail lacquer rubbed off, on her tongue, only a very slight amount, but enough for her to take her thumb out of her mouth after a while and put it on her chin instead. Eventually she started tapping on her chin as well, offbeat to her feet. It wasn�t because she was impatient that she was tapping, and she](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/True-love-only-grows-I-360919581)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Wendy's Wish**Wendy looked in awe at her reflection in the mirror. Instead of the small girl she was used to see she looked at the image of a grown-up teenager, being around the same age and height as the other girls in the guild. Her hair, tied with red ribbons into two pigtails was smooth and voluminous, while her face had lost its childish appearance and had taken on a somewhat mysterious, and what was more important very beautiful expression. Her dark blue socks that went up to her knees rested smoothly on her long and sleek legs, a pair of plump and juicy thighs looking out above, barely covered by her pleated grey mini-skirt. Hugging her cute bubble](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Wendy-s-Wish-356926597) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**True love only grows II**The sound as Britney clicked on the left mouse button was soft and could only be heard for a split second. In her ears however it echoed like a bursting thunder. Letting go of the mouse she raised her hand, putting it on the side of her bosom. Her eyes fixed on the blue bar she eagerly stared at the screen, softly stroking the wide flanks of her bust. The surface of her palms scratched over the jagged rim of the tears, rubbing the fabric faster and harder the longer she waited for her meaty mounds to swell against her palms. As nothing happened for several seconds however she slowed down her caressing, while the corners of her mouth were drop](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/True-love-only-grows-II-361650515)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Tooth fairy meets Boob fairy I**It was a warm summer night in a little town. Moonlight streamed through the half-open window into the bedroom of a small house, bathing the bed inside it in a dim silver sheen. Underneath the blanket a woman was peacefully sleeping, breathing softly as she lay on her back. As it was a warm night she had only covered herself with her blanket up to her belly, leaving her chest and arms free. Between her small, yet decently shaped breasts the four buttons of her light blue pyjama top were resting, all being closed. Slightly they went up and down with each breath the woman made, rising and falling in a slow, steady rhythm. She barely made a sound](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Tooth-fairy-meets-Boob-fairy-I-330773257)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**In retrospect...**Sarah stared into her glass, blushing slightly. With the straw she drew circles on the surface of her juice, nervously shifting around on her chair. �Sooo, how do you feel?", she asked, not looking up from her glass.  
  
�Like a milk-cow", the woman next to her said. Around them, Sarah could hear the whispers of the other guests at the street caf�, constantly glaring over to their table. People passing on the street gazed towards them, their eyes nearly popping out of their heads. �You know, one of those genetically modified with the fat udders."  
  
Silently, Sarah took a sip from her orange juice � coincidentally, &#](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/In-retrospect-202581465)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**50k Race**"All bikers to the starting line! I repeat, all bikers to the starting line!"  
  
Hearing the voice of the announcer Gina stretched herself one more time, raising her right hand far above her head while holding the left one on her hip. She tilted her body to the left and spread out her right leg, her blond smooth hair shining brightly in the afternoon sun as it fell to her shoulder. Finishing her warm-up Gina relaxed her pose again. She wiped a strand of hair from her face and tucked it behind her ear, while her blue eyes threw a casual glance at the large church tower clock above her. Only a few minutes before the race would start. She grabbed](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/50k-Race-318394036) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Snow Boobs**It was a late afternoon in December when a young woman was taking a walk through the park. Flakes danced around her nose as she walked over the snow-clad path, smiling at the white scenery around her. The branches of the trees were buckling under the weight of the snow, while the usually lush and green lawn was hidden beneath an at least two inch deep layer of snow. The path the woman was walking on wasn't quite as snowed, but her large winter boots still left deep imprints behind her. While it wasn't pitch-black the lanterns on each side of the path were already shining, their light reflecting in the surrounding snow, and with each minute th](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Snow-Boobs-275240349)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Dear Dairy**Dear Dairy,  
  
Whoops, typo! But it's kind of funny. Maybe I'll start all my diary entries like that? ;P  
  
Anyway, since quite a few things have happened lately in my life and I don't have anyone right now to talk to (at least yet) I guessed I could start a diary. Of yourse� again a typo, but this one happens actually quite a lot to me ^\_^; Anyway, of yourse it's not like I don't have any friends or a family. Right now, they're all just a few hundred miles away from me. I moved away from home a few days ago for college, and don't know many people here yet. And I'm not really the kind of person who likes to talk all day on the telephone. But](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Dear-Dairy-293882315)

**Holsen's enhancement (part 1)**DECISIONS  
  
'The first pill hooks them. After that, they just can't help themselves, despite the consequences of increased use.' These were some of dr holsen's conclusions after observing the effects of 'the holsen enhancement pills', during their first human trials.  This is the story of those first trials.   
  
It was the second week of uni and Rhiannon had already burned through all of her cash. She'd been told by just about everyone that she needed to be careful with her money, and she thought she could do it. But she couldn't resist the temptation to have just a little more. One more drink, one more pair of jeans, and before she knew it, she](http://nairny.deviantart.com/art/Holsen-s-enhancement-part-1-348255536)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Roslyn the Witch?!** It had been forever long since Roslyn was actually able to simply depart from her daily stresses to stretch her long legs in a long walk. Today, however, she had found the perfect opportunity to do just that. While she was normally busy with her chores or job come Sunday, tonight she sought other interests. Instead, at nine o' clock this Sunday night, she had been freed from her other obligations. Her work at the local craft shop had let her have the day off � without pay, sadly. But there is no such thing as perfect luck �  and the next day was a school holiday county wide. She had been released from her cage!

**BE Married**Adriana Griffin squeezed her long, lean torso up against Ryan Bittan's muscular arm.  "I can't believe we're finally going to go get rings!" she said, the joy in her voice unmistakable.  
  
Ryan smiled down at his fiancee.  He was only 3 inches taller than her, but she was leaning down into his shoulder with her "hug."  "Yeah, I know," he said.  "It does seem like we've been dating forever."  
  
She looked up at him.  "Three years," she said.  "But, next month, it's going to be permanent."  
  
"Next month, Mrs. Bittan?" Ryan said.  "Try in 15 days.  We've already got the l](http://macromega.deviantart.com/art/BE-Married-308685362)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Holsen's enhancement (part 2)**B.E. CLOTHING STORE  
  
'Damn, I could really get used to these things' Rhiannon said to herself. Each time she turned the steering wheel of her cheap ford fiesta, her arms brushed along the sides of her newly fleshed out tits. She soon began to truly appreciate sharp turns. Turning at the next right, she couldn't help but allow a grin to creep onto her face as she subtly caressed herself with her arms.   
  
She was heading back to campus, but first, she knew she would be needing some new and definitely larger clothes. After all, she had every intention of continuing with the experiment.  
  
She turned into the local retail park, and stopped her firey](http://nairny.deviantart.com/art/Holsen-s-enhancement-part-2-348886643)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Picture Perfect**Picture Perfect  
  
"Smile!"  
  
Sonia clicked the shutter button on her camera, recording the scene before her in its digital memory. Photography was her favorite pastime. To her it wasn't just simply pointing a camera and pressing a button, but a work of art that captures the timeless beauty of an individual into a form that will exist forever. Photos weren't just pictures, but memories. Memories splashed beautifully onto a digital canvas and brightened with a smile. That's what these photos were to her, no matter how simple they would seem to anybody else.  
  
"That's a wrap!" she said before leading the family over to a computer and plugging in he](http://xphoenixflare.deviantart.com/art/Picture-Perfect-322014734)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Growth Spurt**Growth Spurt  
  
I moaned as my shirt stretched to fit around my swelling breasts. The buttons held on desperately as my cleavage blossomed before my eyes. I reached down with my hands and tugged downwards on the front of my shirt as I pressed my boobs together with the insides of my arms.  
  
As my double D's continued to billow outwards, I groaned as the fabric squeezed against my growing tits. My shirt felt like it was shrinking and soon become very uncomfortably; it tightened across my back, but the most pressure was obviously in the front.  
  
As I looked down, my cleavage jiggled as it tested my shirt's limits. Out of the four buttons on](http://blueberryjanelle.deviantart.com/art/Growth-Spurt-315356949)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Lust** The most saddening feeling in the world is the feeling of being in love with someone who doesn't know you exist. Holly has found herself in this position.  
  
 Everyday at school, she sees the most gorgeous boy she has ever known. Michael Werden. The boy is charming, built, and oh-so dashing. Almost every period, Holly swoons as he walks past her locker.  
  
 Holly is a beautiful girl. She wears the cutest outfits, has the most gorgeous shade of brown hair, and her eyes are a vivid green. Her face has no imperfections, with soft and luscious skin. Her hair is long and silky. You may be thinking why such a beautiful girl has problems winning over t](http://busting-fabric.deviantart.com/art/Lust-320416805)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)

A dim light spread throughout the room, illuminating the single, tiny bed in its center. The sheets were pulled over something, or someone. The lump of cloth stirred, the figure beneath it shifting in its place. It did it again, and afterwards, more frequently. A soft, feminine groan escaped from under the blankets as the figure rotated its position again. Again, it began its "shifting spree" while releasing a few more uncomfortable grunts. Finally, with a throw of the sheets as they flew and folded at the very end of the bed, the figure released an i](http://ifor1.deviantart.com/art/Headache-Medicine-352899424)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**After School Activities** Kayla's last class of the day, Gym, was running late.  No surprise there considering that it was a Monday.  Even the most caffeinated of students are still sluggish then.  However, Tori was having other problems.  She had just been jumped by her stalker.  
  
 It was Kayla's senior year at her high school and by then she'd become quite popular.  She was an intelligent brunette who stood at 5'6".  She also had great athletic prowess.  And on top of that even, Tori turned heads with her 32DDD-sized chest.  
  
 Which is where her stalker comes into play.  
  
 Tori was Kayla's stalker; sporting glasses and long black hair tied back in pigtails, she was on](http://moonlitesonata.deviantart.com/art/After-School-Activities-274277976)

 Slowly the noise of stretching fabric filled the room as the dress widened under the swelling spheres within. Still numbed from the shock Roxanne stumbled backwards, almost tripping over the spell book she had dropped earlier. Her back hit one of the numerous book shelves in the library, forcing her stop. Pressing her hands against the books the wizard student nervously looked at her breasts, watching them grow from ripe cantaloupes towards larger sorts of melons, being far bigger than the formerly lithe girl had intended them to become. The cut in her already revealing dress widened under the increasing bulk of her buns while the pressure between her breasts increased the bigger they got. As the red fabric was pulled forward it slowly uncovered more of her bust�s sides. Pushing herself off from the shelve Roxanne put her hands on her breasts, feeling them fill out the small empty space in her palm. With a strange mixture of worry and excitement she ran her hands over her swelling curves while staring at them, memorizing every detail of her milkjugs as she watched  
  
No, milkjugs wasn�t enough. Huge milkjugs maybe, or ample? The word �massive� came to mind due to both starting with �m�, but just pairing a word for �breasts� with a synonym for �big� wasn�t really original. Maybe something to describe their appeal? Astonishing, amazing, mesmerizing � mesmerizing, that was a good one! It started with �m� and even had a sound resemblance with memorizing, making the sentence sound even better.   
  
With a strange mixture of worry and excitement she ran her hands over her swelling curves while staring at them, memorizing every detail of her mesmerizing milkjugs as she watched them bulge out from her body. Her fingers gently stroke over the even fabric of her dress, having become so thin she could almost feel her skin through it. As her hands reached the uncovered sides of her bosom Roxanne winced slightly. Touching her firm spheres directly the young woman gulped, but still plunged her fingers into her firm  
  
Plunged? Could you say plunge when pressing your fingers into breasts? With a quick click in the taskbar the word document got replaced by a dictionary internet site. �Plunge�, meant as much as �dive in�. Maybe a bit too abstract� Taking another look at the sentence the word �firm� was used twice, and another word was looked up for it, too. Stout, hard, tight � none really seemed to fit for non-squishy breasts. After searching two more websites with no results �firm spheres� was eventually replaced with �round bumps�.  
  
Touching her round bumps directly the young woman gulped, but still pressed her fingers into her firm meat. Meanwhile the front of her rack continued to reach forward while the rest of her breasts swelled into every direction, blowing up like a pair of balloons.  
  
No, mentioning balloons didn�t really fit into a magic medieval scenario. Plus that metaphor was way too overused.  
  
With a loud sigh Phoebe leaned back against her chair. Her hands slid off the keyboard as she let them hang over the armrests. With her naked feet she spun her office chair around, turning for a few seconds. As she started to feel dizzy from moving in circles she stopped, looking into the opposite direction of the monitor. She took a glance at the clock above the TV. Half past six. She still had two hours before her parents would come back from the movie with her little sister. That was a lot of time, but she doubted to get the story done by then if she continued in that speed. And who knew when the next opportunity to write would come up?  
  
�I wish they would release �Winnie the Pooh�-movies in a weekly rhythm�, Phoebe murmured to herself, leaning against the headrest as she rolled her eyes up to the ceiling. Depending on the light the colour of her iris could be described as anything between grey and blue � some people even told her she actually had green eyes. Staring at the lamp hanging from the ceiling Phoebe crossed her legs on her seat, stroking the black denim of her wide jeans slightly. Why did the only computer in the house have to stand in the living room anyway? Sure, it was a family computer, she didn�t expect it to be put it into her room. But there were some private places in the house suited better for a PC than the living room � there was actually an entire room they didn�t need for anything but storage the old toys and baby stuff when she and her sister had been younger. They could just throw this all way and turn it into a small office room for the entire family, so everyone who wanted to do some browsing could have a little privacy. �Maybe that�s the reason why it�s here�, she mused. �So Mom can check the websites Dad visits. And vice versa.�  
  
With another sigh she put her feet back on the ground and turned the chair around. As she faced the monitor again she stopped. The momentum of the turn caused the tips of her dark brown, almost black hair to fall in front of her eyes � her bangs always had the tendency to block her sight. She didn�t dare to cut them as short as the rest of her hair however for she was afraid people could see her forehead. She always found her hairline was WAY too high. Whipping the strands from her forehead she lowered her gaze back towards the PC. Again she checked the time. According to the computer it was actually two minutes before six. Still her fingers tapped nervously on the armrests, as if she expected her parents and sister to appear in the window door on the other side of the room any second and see her super-secret word document she had buried inside six hidden folders in the depths of the PC. What if they came back earlier, she wondered in a moment of nervousness. But she quickly shook off that thought. They had just called ten minutes ago they had arrived at the cinema, and were on the way to their seats. The movie would last one and a half hour, and then they would need at least another half hour back home. Plus even if they suddenly appeared and looked through the window, all they would see was her in front of Word. It wasn�t like the text formed a pair of giant breasts one could see from ten feet away.  
  
While she calmed herself the thought struck her again to just confess to her parents and friends. It would make writing stories much easier since she didn�t need to be so secretive about it, and certainly put a huge weight off her chest. But not even a second after it had struck her she immediately scratched this thought as well. It wasn�t like she was afraid to tell them. She just couldn�t imagine how her parents would react when she told them their shy little daughter had a growing breasts fetish. To everyone in her environment, she was actually known as a rather prude person � which she was most of the time. The most revealing thing she ever put on was the short-sleeved red T-shirt with the yellow rubber duck logo on the front she was wearing in that moment. She couldn�t watch pornographic material without feeling sick, blushed whenever she saw too much naked skin (independent of the gender) and found it silly how many concerns promoted their products by showing half-naked women and men. Her friends often teased her about her shyness, especially when they started talking about boys and her only contribution to the conservation was to blush the entire time.   
  
There was only one aspect of her that didn�t seem to fit into her otherwise sheepish personality: Her fetish for growing breasts. They didn�t need to be naked, there didn�t need to be sex involved, it actually didn�t even matter if the breasts got really big. But the thought about breasts growing rapidly out from a woman�s body always had a strange kind of fascination to her, and certainly provided a form of satisfaction, even arousal. She had often wondered why she had these fantasies, especially since she was a girl and, as far as she knew, not lesbian. It could be because of her lack of own feminine curves, her appearance being pretty well described with the word �slender�, if not even thin, but that was probably though too short. It was most likely something in her genes, she thought. Probably from her dad.  
  
At first she had played this part of her down. But once she had made her first experiences with the internet and found she wasn�t the only person obsessed with growing breasts she slowly came more into contact with that side of hers, started looking at pictures and reading stories. The latter especially enticed her, for a really good BE story was the best way to portray the swelling of a bosom. A year ago she had gathered her courage and begun to write BE stories herself. The response she had gotten was rather positive, so she had continued. She soon grew to like writing a lot, and it quickly became one of her hobbies. However, she had never told anyone of her family or friends about this hobby. She just couldn�t imagine how any of them would react once they found out the shy and prude Phoebe had a fetish. Plus the sheer thought of going to her parents and telling them about it made the shy and prude Phoebe blush already. �Everything will be better once I get that laptop for Christmas�, she told herself. Then she would have more privacy and could write more regularly. Sometimes she wondered if it was really a good thing though to go deeper into this BE thing, or if she should fight it down � it was sort of woman-discriminating and -objectifying, she couldn�t deny that. Then again she didn�t really hurt anybody with it, and having sexual fantasies wasn�t a crime. The stuff she produced couldn�t even be called pornographic, barely erotic. All she did was writing about women growing bigger breasts. Surely it wasn�t something to be proud of, but at least she didn�t have any fantasies involving striking people with whips or binding them to the bed or something.  
  
She then realised ten minutes had passed without her writing down anything. �I�m wasting time�, she murmured. Putting her focus back on the word document she pressed her elbow against the desk, and leaned her head against her hand. As she scanned her text for errors she stroke with her index finger over one of her pimples. It wasn�t like her face was stained with them, but she had three of four on each of her cheeks, plus a few on her forehead, and various blackheads. The nineteen year old mournfully wondered when puberty would finally be over for her. �At least I can still hope to grow some curves�, the slender girl joked, though she knew a late growth spurt was rather unlikely for an already 5�74 tall girl. The red pimples and spots on her face were made even more apparent by the bleak tone of her skin, the only slightly tanned part of her face being her big nose. Around it her skin was a little red, as if she was having slight sunburn. All in all Phoebe was far away from having a perfect appearance, but she certainly possessed her own visual charm.  
  
After she stroke her pimples a bit she lifted her head, and put both her hands on the keyboard. She tapped around on the keys, making a dissatisfied frown as she read the text on the screen. Her lack of time to write wouldn�t be so much of a problem if she wasn�t so damn picky. No matter what she wrote, she was never satisfied with it. She always was afraid her growth descriptions to sound weird or that it made no sense what she wrote � or even simpler, that it was just bad. She constantly tried to tell herself not to worry too much, but she couldn�t shake off the thought her writing was flawed and clumsy, no matter how much praise she received. And the reception her stories received everytime she uploaded one were always very positive, almost euphoric. Although sometimes, she did wonder if it was really her writing people loved or just the fact she wrote about growing boobs.  
  
As she was reading her manuscript she found several sections she would like to scratch out and write completely new. �As the red fabric was pulled forward it slowly uncovered more of her bust�s sides� � there was something about the sentence she didn�t like. It sounded so simple. She put her hand on her mouse, but hesitated to move the cursor. Eventually she let go, pressing her hands against her face. What else could she say? �The fabric moved over her roundings�? �It was stretching around her curves�? It didn�t really make a difference. Ignoring it for the moment she put her hands back on her keyboard, staring at the end of the last paragraph. She tried to think of a way to continue: �while the rest of her breasts swelled�� she stared at the sentence for one minute. Then for two. Two became three, and soon three became five, and so on. Eventually it was half past six and she was no word further than half an hour ago.   
  
�Damn writer�s block!�, Phoebe mourned. Feeling extremely tired and worn out she sat quietly for a moment, trying to gather her thoughts. As she swallowed and noticed her throat was kind of dry. She rolled her head over the headrest, looking at the bottle of lemonade next to the monitor. �Maybe a little sip will give me some �inspiration��, she murmured, raising an arm. While grabbing the lemonade her eyes were fixated on the word document, Phoebe thinking of how to continue as she opened the bottle. Her breasts swelled � her breasts grew � her breasts expanded�  quickly she ran out of synonyms. Another sigh made its way out of her mouth. It was only a matter of time before she would open up the internet browser in frustration, visit youtube and then spend the rest of the evening watching stupid videos until her parents came home. Or, she thought as she put the bottle on her lips, she would end up on deviantart looking at BE pictures she had seen a hundred times already.  
  
Tilting the bottle she let the lemonade flow into her mouth. A surprisingly sour taste hit her tongue. She liked sour, but she didn�t expect the taste to be so intense. Quickly she pulled the bottle back from her lips, cautious not to spill anything on her shirt or keyboard. She gulped down the sour lemonade, panting a little as she let her tongue hang out from her mouth. �Wow, that�s one hell of a lemonade�, she said to herself, putting the bottle back on the desk. Leaning back in the chair she stared at her story again. How should it continue? Phoebe scrolled through the document, searching for a cue, while with her other hand she scratched her chest as it was itching slightly. If she just could get an inspiration from somewhere. Scratching her chest with both hands as the itching got stronger she thought about searching the internet for one, in form of an image or story � no, that never worked. The only �inspiration� she got there led to many things, but writing wasn�t one of them. She pushed herself a bit back from the desk, crossed her legs and looked up at the ceiling again. Her shoulders twitched slightly as the itching in her chest got stronger, and she began to wriggle slightly inside her chair. She scratched her flat bosom ever stronger, almost damaging the rubber duck on her T-shirt. �Jeez, what is this?�, she asked annoyed, looking down on her slender torso. �It�s almost as if in one of my stories, just before the girl realises her boobs are getting-�  
  
As she continued to scratch herself she suddenly noticed the flesh was slightly pressing back against the tips of her fingers. Immediately she stopped, thinking at first to be hallucinating. Through the itching in her chest however she realised there was some other sensation in her chest, a feeling she denied at first. But after a few seconds it became pretty clear to Phoebe her chest was swelling out from her body, softly pressing against her top. Throwing her glance down her chest she watched quite perplexed two distinct bumps rising up from the fabric of her T-shirt, each only a few millimetres thick, but slowly growing.   
  
�WHOA!�   
  
The chair fell over as she jumped up. Wide-eyed Phoebe stared at her chest, grasping her hands around the little bulges in her top. She gasped as her non-existent breasts surged against her palms, slowly filling out the space in her hands. �Wha� what the hell?!�, she screamed. Where a few moments ago only the sight of an even area had met her eyes a pair of little mounds was poking out from her body, only subtly, but her top was definitely more filled out than it should have been. The itching in her chest decreased the further her breasts rose up from the rest of her chest, their slopes growing and spreading out over the upper half of her torso. While the �roots� of her breasts expanded their curves steadily arched forward, increasing their volume and the roundness of their shape. �What the hell?!�, Phoebe shrieked again, the small swells compressing the fabric of her shirt between her palms and rising roundings. �Did� did I just get warped into one of my stories or what is going on here?!�   
  
She wondered for a moment if she may have fallen asleep in front of the PC and was dreaming. But while breast expansion had been part of her dreams before it usually involved other characters she had seen pictures of in the internet, not herself. Plus for a dream, putting the growing mass of tissue in her top aside, things were making too much sense. In a dream nothing was constant. From one second to the next the environment, the people around you, even who you were could completely change. Phoebe�s situation however stayed pretty much the same, with the only inconsistence being the steadily larger size of her bust. As she stood in front of the desk her breasts slowly flowed out from her body, pushing on her hands and pulling her T-shirt around them. She could clearly feel her fingers squeezing against her flesh, bending under the rising curves of her bosom as it vaulted forward. The more she became aware these sensations were real the less Phoebe was able to believe it. Partly panicked she groped her growing breasts as if to check this was really not a dream. Concentrating on her breasts she could clearly feel them bulge through the space between her fingers, steadily reaching forward and throwing larger wrinkles. Their size wasn�t very striking, but already rather apparent compared to before, probably able to fill out the cups of an A-cup bra. �O-oh my gosh�, she whispered, slowly accepting this was really happening. Watching her bosom blow up she swallowed dryly, not knowing what she should do. Should she get hysterical? Freak out? Or be happy one of her most intimate fantasies was turning into reality? Nervously she rubbed her fingers over the stretching fabric of her T-shirt, feeling each additional ounce of mass in her hands.   
  
The movements of her fingers stopped. Phoebe still stared at her growing bosom, but it seemed like she wasn�t really paying attention to it. Raising her glance she looked at the monitor in front of her, seeing her open word document. Her hands carefully left the surface of her chest, revealing the little bump that reached out a rough half inch from her body, and moved towards the keyboard. As she leaned over the desk she felt her breasts �hanging� against her top, at least as much as a pair of mini-breasts could hang. She hesitated a moment. Slowly at first, then steadily faster she typed, adding word after word to the text on the screen.  
  
*Meanwhile the front of her rack continued to reach forward while the rest of her breasts swelled into every direction, Roxanne feeling each additional ounce of mass in her hands.*  
  
Phoebe looked at the text. Though she tried to concentrate on what she had written her breasts didn�t vanish from her focus completely as they continued to expand. They were quickly conquering the little slack in her T-shirt, pulling the fabric tautly around them. A few seconds later her fingers flew over the keyboard again.  
  
*Meanwhile the front of her rack continued to reach forward while the rest of her breasts pulled the already constricting fabric of her dress even tauter around them, Roxanne feeling each additional ounce of mass in her hands.*  
  
She looked at the revised sentence. At the same time one of her hands left the keyboard and went back on her bosom, gently squishing and rubbing the firm mass of meat as it charged into new territory. Keeping one hand on her chest she put the other on her mouse, and marked the first part of the sentence. While stroking her bosom with one hand she rewrote it with her other one:  
  
*Gently squishing and rubbing the firm mass of meat as the front of her rack was charging into new territory her breasts pulled the already constricting fabric of her dress even tauter around them, Roxanne feeling each additional ounce of mass in her hands.*  
  
Phoebe removed both her hands from their current positions and put them on the edge of the desk, examining her work. Almost unconsciously she began to nod, and a small smile spread over her lips. Still leaning forward she suddenly straightened her body upon realising the swelling sensation had left her chest. Immediately she looked down on herself, quickly examining them. To say her breasts were big was still far of an overstatement, but the rubber duck logo of her shirt was lying over a small bulge that stretched the fabric of her T-shirt slightly. They were still so small they barely touched each other inside her top and had practically no curves, being not more than a rather plain pair of domes. As Phoebe stared at her small breasts she noticed something else: They were deflating. The volume of her bump was slowly decreasing, her expanded mammary tissue seemingly moving back into her body. Phoebe let out a sigh that could be both interpreted as relief or disappointment. Many questions though were hanging inside her head, the most prominent being: why?  
  
A trigger, she thought, there must have been some kind of trigger. But what could have caused it? She took a look through the room, searching a (more or less) plausible explanation for her sudden growth spurt. Eventually her eyes met the bottle of lemonade on the table. �That�s crazy�, she murmured. She then looked down on her chest again. �On the other hand, my boobs just blew up. And lemonade that makes boobs blow up isn�t crazier than boobs that just blew up.�  
  
For a moment Phoebe stood quiet in the room, staring up and down between her bosom and the lemonade. Behind her she could hear the ticking of the clock, while she could feel the pressure on her shirt steadily weakening as her chest sunk back into her body. Her fingers twitched slightly as she reached out a hand towards the bottle, carefully grasping it around the neck. From her desk then she slowly raised it towards her mouth. She had forgotten to put the top back on it, so she just placed the bottle on her lips. After hesitating a moment she tilted it slightly.   
  
Again the sour taste hit her tongue. She endured it longer than last time, gulping three mouthfuls of the lemonade down before she released it from her mouth. Just as she had put it back on the desk the itching in her shrinking chest returned, but she decided not to scratch herself. As it steadily grew more intense she wondered for a moment if scratching might be necessary for the growth to begin, when a feeling of swelling answered that question with a clear no. Having almost deflated to their previous non-size her breasts abruptly reversed their direction, starting to grow out from her body again.   
  
For a short moment Phoebe stared with big eyes at her bust, before moving her glance to the bottle of lemonade as she had just proven it had been responsible for the expansion. After a few seconds the increase in flesh on her front threw her out of her trance, her disbelief getting replaced by a nervous, but positive excitement. Quickly she set the chair back down and placed her little rump in the seat. She put her hands on the keyboard, closing her eyes as she focused on the feeling of her flesh swelling against her T-shirt. The curves of her breasts steadily vaulted, forcing their form on the fabric of her top. As the bump ascended from the rest of her figure and the front of her bust line moved away from her the area her bosom required on her torso slowly expanded. The tops of her little perkers reached upwards while the bottoms swelled into the opposite direction, becoming gradually rounder and more voluminous. This was true for the sides of each her breasts as well as they were flaring both outwards and against each other. The empty space created between them as the fabric was lifted off her chest steadily shrunk, their inner curves gradually arching towards each other. In the very moment the walls of her cleavage came into contact, softly squeezing their swelling slopes Phoebe let out a gasp. It was unrelated to a form of arousal however, but instead a sign of a burst of inspiration that overcame the young writer. Swiftly her fingers started to work on the keyboard, her imagination fuelled by her growing sweater meat as she typed.  
  
*Keeping her hands on the sides of her bust its curves continued to vault. Her dress had moved so far over her breasts it showed their entire sides, lying as two horizontal straps of red fabric over her perkers. The cover on their more private areas was forcefully bending under her arching bosom despite being near the maximum of what it was capable to stretch to. All around the slopes of her breasts were spreading out into every direction, keeping the firmness of her rack intact even at the absurd dimensions they had blown up to. Roxanne almost gasped as the tops of breasts larger than her head ascended towards her face, being on height with her neck already. Meanwhile she felt a rising amount of her body below her bosom being covered by the shadow its underside casted, while the sides of her bust flared beyond her shoulders, pushing her hands along. With each millimeter her breasts surged outwards the pressure in her generous cleavage increased, her breasts squeezing against each other on a rising, steadily flattening surface. As her dress�*  
  
Phoebe suddenly stopped. Just as she felt the spurt of her growth coming to an end the spring of her inspiration was dying off as well. She glanced down at her chest, seeing it was by a good notch larger than last time, dancing on the rim between A- and B-cup. The bump in her shirt then began to deflate again, moving back into her body. Still a bit nervous, but more confidently she grabbed the bottle of lemonade. More determinate she took another sip, again swallowing more lemonade than she had on her last drink. The itching immediately returned, and a few seconds later her deflation turned into inflation once more, the rubber duck on her shirt getting pushed forward by a growing bosom again. As it was pulled around her bust she felt her shirt was slightly starting to move all over her body, slowly being wrapped around her curves. It was low, but her top began to make some noise as it tightened around her globes. Though it could barely be heard it sounded almost as if the fabric was screaming in pain, begging her swelling mounds to stop. Mercilessly however her mammaries reached out from her, growing from slight bumps towards a pair of round domes sticking out to the front. Clearly leaving A-cup measurements behind it looked like a pair of tennis balls was tucked under her shirt, while inside her top the little meat buns were rubbing with gradually more force against each other. Despite the lack of a bra they firmly pointed out from her chest, as if gravity didn�t have an effect on them. Phoebe looked down, her initial worry and shock completely getting replaced by amazement as she saw a small rack where a few seconds ago there was a nothing but a plain board. The sight of her little bust and the sound of stretching stitching made her fantasy climb new heights, and as her bosom continued to spread into new dimensions itself she busily wrote down her experiences.  
  
*As her dress continued to move over the curves of her globes Roxanne could hear the noise the fabric made while stretching around them becoming quickly louder. With her breasts steadily growing larger they soon breached on what her dress was able to handle, her clothes almost screeching around her expanding bosom. The pitiful screams of her wardrobe however didn�t have any effect on her swelling mammary melons, merciless trying to tear it apart to make room for their impressive girth as they were clearly outgrowing her head. With the space between them having become rather limited they forcefully rubbed against each other, leaving not even a milimeter of cleavage between them. Roxanne saw and felt the immense size of her assets, but what amazed her even more was their gravity-defying firmness. Her doubts and worries dissolved as she got aware this were her breasts, breasts that a few moments ago hadn�t been there. A smile crept over her face, and*  
  
Phoebe tapped around on the keyboard, waiting for an inspiration. As the stretching of her shirt became lower she grabbed the bottle again. Four gulps of lemonade went down her throat, and even before she put it back on the desk she could already feel the itching in her chest. This time it only took very shortly before the itching calmed down and her dying growth spurt received a boost. Phoebe began to really like the feeling of her T-shirt being strained over her burgeoning breasts as they were flattening out all remaining wrinkles on the fabric, making it lie skin-tight around their rising slopes. Her fingers twitched on the keys, Phoebe putting her head back slightly as a foreign pleasure build up in her. In a sudden motion her hands changed their position from the keyboard right on the front of her arching bosom, ruffling the tight fabric around it slightly. Touching her mounds she could feel their curves distending from her body, swelling against her palms and squeezing against her fingers while the pressure between them also increased. Gently she pressed her wrists into the flaring flanks of her bust, sensing they not only looked firm, but their structure was actually rather stout. Still, her fingers left slight sinks on the fabric as she dug them into her bulging flesh. A satisfied sigh slipped through her lips. With every inch of her hands she tenderly massaged her little hemi-spheres as they slowly grew out to a pair of spheres. Ploughing her palms and fingers through her swelling flesh she leaned further against the lean of her chair, savoring the feeling of growth. As she kneaded her breasts she felt them slowly outgrowing the space of her hands, becoming too large to hold them entirely. Their shape was about to completely change from half-spherical to full orbs, their curves bending outwards while moving out from her body. While she continued to expand from the size of grapefruits steadily into a buxom D-cup Phoebe removed one hand from her bust, and while busily massaging her chest with one hand continued to write.  
  
*A smile crept over her face, and her fingers twitched slightly on her swelling breasts. After tapping around on them for a bit she spread out her fingers as far from each other as she could, putting the surface of her hands on the sides of her swelling rack. Fighting against the distending slopes of her bosom her palms, wristlets and fingers all simultaneously pressed against them, forcing a soft imprint into the massive flanks of her bust. The front line of her bosom moved a little further forward while her cleavage got even more compressed. Her dress also groaned a little louder as Roxanne squeezed her breasts, using steadily more force since their resistance increased the bigger they became. The wizard student gulped, but then let out a very content sigh of satisfaction. Rolling her eyes she leaned even further against the shelf behind her while sticking out her chest from her body, making the perky pumpkins look even more prominent. The front segment of fingers crooked and straightened at an asynchronous rate as she began to knead her firm flesh � tenderly, but with a strong touch. Massaging her chest like this the growth began to feel even better to her, agitating her hands to move steadily faster. Soon she was basically ploughing through her meat like a farmer through his fields, going over the gradually increasing surface of her bottom�s flanks. Feeling her already outrageously large orbs bend beneath her hands and gain ever more lushness spurred the ecstasy of the young woman even further.*  
  
Despite being in the middle of a �writing spree� and her growth making no signs of dying off yet Phoebe grabbed the bottle, and put it on her grinning mouth. The sour taste almost burned her tongue as she gulped down the lemonade, drinking a rough quarter of the bottle�s contents before she put it down again. A single drop of it dripped on her shirt, right on the rubber duck that was lying over a pair of apparent mammary glands around the diameter of CDs. No itching overcame her chest this time, but the lemonade directly went into her already rather sizeable assets. Wearing a big smirk on her face Phoebe felt her expansion accelerate, her bust swelling faster and faster out from her. Its sides were reaching the edge of her lean body, the widest part of her globes starting to lap over them, while the pressure in her cleavage caused the front of her breasts to shift slightly to the side, making it rub over the fabric. Having one hand still on her bust she moved it to the most protruding parts of her breasts, stroking the foreside of her bosom as it surged steadily further away from her. Her shirt was growing so tense she could hear small stretching sounds whenever she moved her fingers over the taut fabric. Playfully she drew circles over the curves of her bust, listening to the �music� her top made. It was getting hard to hear though as the noise of stretching cotton was getting louder in general, trying to contain her breasts as they swelled into E-cup-territory, getting close to F and beyond. With her breasts steadily approaching the size of her head their tops were also rising nearer towards her neck, the perfectly round slopes bulging evenly upwards. Moving her hand to the undersides of her bosom she felt it being just as firm on the other side, not sagging down the slightest, but keeping a spherical, globular shape. As she could see her cleavage through her T-shirt, the taut fabric starting to become transparent her hands twitched nervously. While she had the urge to grope herself numb she instead removed her hands from her bust and put them back on the keyboard, quickly starting to write so she could distract herself a little from the joy of growth � but really, only a little.   
  
*With her excitement growing almost faster than her breasts Roxanne left any plausible size measurements behind, becoming abnormally busty. Having slipped out completely of the cover her dress could provide the flanks of her bosom stood out from her flimsy clothing, shining bare in the light. Being far wider than her shoulders and hips on their widest parts they soon were large enough to be visible even from behind, lapping greatly over her body, and reached bit by bit further to the sides. Additionally to the sound of stretching stitching she could also hear the first threads popping on the ridiculously strained �holders� that rested over the private areas of her bust. Becoming steadily thinner ever more cleavage was exposed, the tight valley of flesh having shrunken so far there was barely any place for her curves to arch towards. As a result the protruding foreside of her globes shifted a little to the side, causing them to rub over the tense fabric. Feeling pleasantly aroused by her growth Roxanne pressed her fingers a little deeper into her breasts. While stroking her stout meat constantly harder she began to make circling motions with her hands, steadily enlarging until she led them from the top of her breasts over their front down to the bottom, and then back up over their vaulting flanks. A short glance down and her sight was met with tight cleavage between the ascending tops of her bust, being nearly on height with her chin. Smiling at her steadily larger pumpkins of meat she closed her eyes, while trying to restrain her hands so much she wouldn�t hurt herself.*   
  
As she wrote Phoebe�s own breasts continued to wrap ever more fabric around themselves, making it creak steadily louder as it stretched over her billowing curves. The bulbous attachments projecting from her chest steadily conquered the empty space surrounding them, having turned into voluminous stacks of meat larger than the bosoms of most grown-up women. Her bust front was almost eight inches out from the rest of her body, moving bit by bit further forward while vaulting to a constantly rounder surface. On the sides they were nearly overlapping her arms, having grown out so far from her body they really looked like a pair of small balls tucked under her shirt. The tops of her mounds reached the bottom of her neck while their bottoms reached the top of her belly. As she continued to write her breasts were starting to block her sight on her keyboard. Phoebe had to lean forward to be able to see it completely. Her breasts hung against the slightly transparent fabric of her shirt, making it groan a little louder while the rubber duck on the front was starting to get blurred.  
  
*A low tearing sound came from her left breast. On the side of the holder-like band of fabric a small rip started to form at the center of her bosom, slowly extending to the right. A symmetrical rip appeared on her other breast a moment later. As her dress began to give in her bust seemed to reach out a slightly faster pace while some pressure was released from her cleavage. Roxanne looked up from the swelling surface of her bust straight forward, watching the tops of her globes ascend into her sight. With a wide smile she put her hand over the widest parts of her breasts, letting them swell against her palms for a few seconds before she harshly grabbed her mammary meat. Fighting against their firmness she formed two bulbs with her fingers, slowly twisting the flesh around. She gasped loudly as she let go of her breasts and they jumped back into a perfectly spherical shape, while at the same time the wizard student slightly went into her knees. Roxanne put her arms on the bottom of her bosom so it�s immense weight wouldn�t drag her down, while softly stoking over the bulging slopes.*  
  
Despite getting bigger than her head Phoebe�s breasts still were incredibly firm, their lower curves feeling just as round as everywhere else as she rubbed her hands over their undersides. Small rills were drawn by her fingers into her bosom as they drove over the fabric, immediately bulging out again once they left their current spot. Phoebe could feel how the slopes of her breasts were gradually growing beneath her palms, while at the same time she began to feel her breath on the top of her bosom as it arched upwards. As she put her hands back on the keyboard she pressed her arms into the sides of her assets, squeezing their widest part until they reached only to the roots of her shoulders. The front of her rack surged forward, pressing against the rubber duck logo. Although it was the thickest part of her shirt it became slightly transparent, while her cleavage shined clearer through the rest of her top.   
  
*Becoming as thin as the fabric of a negligee her dress bit by bit gave away, the rips getting steadily larger. Only a few millimeters and it would completely split apart, and her naked orbs would spill out of their flimsy cover. Very slowly and gently she moved her hands on the front of her breasts, rubbing as thoroughly through her flesh as possible before she placed her palms on the peaks of her orbs. She waited a moment, letting her mammaries press with all their force against her dress and hands as they billowed to a pair of giant medicine balls. With a snapping sound both her dress eventually gave away. Roxanne let the fabric slip out beneath her hands, feeling it glide down her curves. It was a very soft feeling, as if someone was stroking her with a feather. At the same time she felt her bosom jiggle slightly, wobbling forth and back from the release in pressure.*  
  
The first seams popped in the red stitching of her top, Phoebe feeling the fabric glide over her bust as the connections in it loosened. Having outgrown the breasts of any girl or woman she knew they had wrapped the majority of her shirt around them, revealing her slim belly as the hem had been lifted up. She almost believed to hear her breasts rubbing against each other, being cramped by the limit of her top and her arms that still squeezed them together. With her upper arms she began to rub the sides of her bosom while she continued to write, feeling the   
  
*firm flesh move as she intensely groped the front of her rack. Ripples and waves went through it, intensifying the harder Roxanne fondled herself. The motions caused the parts of her dress still lying on the top of her bosom to slide down as well, falling to the ground as her dress had been held around her neck. Completely naked her assets continued to swell larger, Roxanne still massaging them while going deeper and deeper into her knees. Their increasing weight made her go down until her butt was almost on the ground, her breasts pressing against her thighs. She pressed her back against the shelve behind her, trying not to fall forward because of the weight of her bosom. It was so heavy it caused her*  
  
back to ache, Phoebe almost feeling her spine crumble. Despite their compression she could still feel the roundness of her spheres, being probably firmer than any other parts of her body. Thinner and thinner her shirt grew around them, making every inch of cleavage clearly visible through it. The bottom of her globes was  
  
*reaching her belly button, pressing with rising force against her knees and thighs. Roxanne was almost sitting on the ground, her breasts so huge she could barely keep her hands on their fronts. Reaching upwards they started to press against her chin, forcing her to raise her head*   
  
so she could still see the keyboard despite her bosom blocking her steadily more of her sight on it, but despite the hardships she took in  
  
*every single milligram her breasts gained, every inch her bust line surged forward and every*   
  
bit of volume added to her bosom with great joy, massaging her flesh with her arms until the  
  
 *friction caused it literally to become hot and she had to*  
  
stop her caressing, but still slightly twitched her  
  
*fingers on the spreading surface of her*  
  
breasts, eventually not caring  
  
*anymore as the weight of her breasts caused her to topple forward and collapse in ecstasy.*   
  
Raising her hands from her keyboard Phoebe slid down her chair until her butt nearly feel off the edge. Her mammaries wobbled, both from the impact as well as from Phoebe�s laboured breath as exhaustion was overcoming her. While drops of sweat started to run down her forehead and the rest of her face she could feel the growth of her assets slowing down. �Wow�, she whispered. �That was�� She looked down on herself, flashing a smile as almost her entire sight was filled out by her huge bosom. ��very productive.�  
  
Slowly she sat up again. Her movements were very careful as she didn�t want to ruin her shirt, the fabric squeaking at every little motion as if it was about to burst apart any second. As she sat in her chair again she admired the size of her breasts for a moment, each being around as large as a pumped up volleyball. She watched the last phase of her growth, the rubber duck stretching until it was roughly twice as wide as before she could see and feel no more gain in hjer assets. She continued to stare at their marvellous magnitude until she could feel them starting to deflate again. The sight of her bosom moving back into her body made her frown for a second, but then Phoebe shrugged, causing her shrinking spheres to jiggle, and raised her glance towards the screen. Leaning forward so her bust wouldn�t block it she looked at the text in front of her, a rather satisfied expression on her face. Placing her hands back on the keyboard she added a small ending to the story, in form of Roxanne�s teacher (a middle-aged sorceress) coming into the library, interrupting the growth of her student, scolding her for searching using a spell from her private library without permission and sending her off so she can prepare a �cure�, but once the embarrassed Roxanne has dragged her bosom out of the library her teacher picks up the book with the BE spell and begins chanting the incantation � Phoebe giggled as she could already imagine the comments demanding a sequel. Once she was finished she nodded in approval, smiling upon her creation. All left was to check for spelling errors and she could upload it before her family returned.  
  
As she read the story however her satisfied smile slowly turned into a critical frown. Putting her elbow on the desk she leaned her head against her fist. Her arm graced her bosom in this position, pressing slightly against it, though the contact got weaker the smaller her breasts became. Looking at the segments she had written before the �incident� she found them to be not nearly as good as the rest. Also, upon examining the product of her inspiration a little closer, she couldn�t help but think at certain passages they still could be better. �The motions caused the parts of her dress still lying on the top of her bosom to slide down as well� � would people really get she meant the holders were connected at her neck like on an evening dress? And while the general level of detail was okay there were still a lot of segments that could be fleshed out in her opinion, or be revised for a better style. It especially bothered her to have used the term �medicine balls� in a medieval scenario. She tried to think of a comparison more fitting, but nothing that size that was commonly known and existed in the Middle Ages came to her mind. Frustrated she leaned back against her chair again, letting out a sigh.  
   
Almost slyly she looked at the bottle of lemonade. It was still half-full.   
  
Her gaze shifted to the clock at the PC. To her surprise it was just a few minutes before seven, meaning she had still a good hour left. She looked at the story in front of her while tapping nervously on the armrests of her chair. As her breasts had deflated to a pair of small melons she grabbed the bottle. �I think I can come up with something better�, she murmured, putting it on her lips.

The idea for this story is actually �ancient�, I got it around two years ago. Back then I didn�t have a laptop, and since my PC is placed in a rather public place in our house I could only write when nobody was around or I could be sure they were busy(nobody of my family or friends knows about my fetish � or at least I hope so). It�s much easier now with a laptop, I can even write in public places. Still, I decided to finally write this little story about a girl who secretly writes BE stories, and even though it doesn�t quite represent my situation as much as it used to there�s still quite some self-reflection mixed into it (I�m not a girl though, just to avoid questions ![;)](./I3reacl_files/wink.gif ";) (Wink)")). Plus writing a BE story with a BE story within seemed like it would be fun. Enjoy!  
  
(Before anyone asks about the lemonade: A miscast magic ritual performed by an alien race caused a malfunction in a futuristic machine which led to an overdose of radioactive growth hormones to be added to it. And milk was somehow involved too.)

Great writing. It's verbose without being padded, and the tempo is impeccable. Plus it's a good BE story too. Plus meta humor. All told, it's a breath of fresh air.

I'll help here. 'Verbose' means 'wordy', or 'using many words' (I'm assuming that they are good ones) without overdoing it.  
'Impeccable' is 'without error' or maybe, in this case 'superb'.  
'Meta' here probably means 'good' or 'excellent', although in a literal use, it would mean 'beyond' or 'transcending' humor.  
  
Just out of vulgar curiosity, what is your first language? Because you do use English very well.

That was supremely sexy. I wish something like that would happen to me when I'm looking for inspiration for breast expansion stories. You continue to be the absolute master of describing growing breasts.

Great story dude, if you were to make a sequel, maybe make it on the teacher that walked in at the end? Just a thought, or maybe continue a sequel with this character?

Great story!  
Even the story within the story is great!!  
  
I love the descriptions, and the fact that the "main" character actually has some depth to her.  
  
Very well pased, nicely described and fantastically wrapped!  
  
PD:  
The notes in the description are a very good detail. I really liked the character so much, I didn't even care about explanation on the lemonade. I think that's the mark of a really good story, so far as the characters are well fleshed out (no pun intended) the circumstances are besides the point.

Thank you kindly for the comment ![:)](./I3reacl_files/smile.gif ":) (Smile)") It's nice you like this story overall, from character to setup and growth. Yeah, for that kind of story, it's the best if to lure the reader in so much he doesn't start questioning the (missing) logic^^

Awesome story! This is a great take on the old 'Expansion writer experiences growth herself' trope, and it's almost two stories for the price of one. Some great descriptive prose too.

This is great. I love how it shows the writer's scenario while presenting the inner story. I had the same problem for awhile, although I rarely write about my fetishes.

 | Deviousness

[:iconfaestock:](http://faestock.deviantart.com/) `[faestock](http://faestock.deviantart.com/) is one of our best known and popular deviants from the Stock and Resources community. Her gallery is filled to the brim with high quality stock photographs that have inspired deviants to get creative, and turn the already beautiful images into something magical. Jessica always takes time to reach out to deviants, providing contests and nurturing other artists. We're inspired by her selfless attitude and dedication to a genre that we couldn't create without. It's with great pleasure that we award the Deviousness Award for September 2013 to `[faestock](http://faestock.deviantart.com/), congratulations.  [Read More](http://today.deviantart.com/)

**The genie from the milk bottle 2**There it was, hanging from Amanda's chest: A pair of smooth breasts, shaped into such a perfectly spherical form it looked like someone had molded them in meticulous detail work. Despite the firmness that made them stick out proudly from the body attached to them their flesh gave slightly in to the hands that wandered over them. Softly the tender meat was caressed as the fingers wandered from the fabric on the flanks to the skin revealed in the cleavage, kneading the breasts like a baker his dough. Amanda rubbed her palms over her sensitive mounds, wondering how large they were. Grapefruits? Cantaloupes? It was something in between that was s](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/The-genie-from-the-milk-bottle-2-311517078)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**More Milk for More Maidens**"Aren't you done changing yet, April?", Victoria yelled from the kitchen. As her younger co-worker didn't reply she sighed. "Man, first day in our first job, and she can't even get into her uniform." Lowering her green eyes the tall girl looked at the clothes she wore: A short black dress alongside a white apron and matching boots. There was also a white maiden's cap tucked into her short crimson hair. "The chief maiden will be here any moment", she mumbled. "Said something about a "special test" on the phone. And that butler just gave us our uniforms and told us to go straight into the kitchen once we have changed � the rich surely are](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/More-Milk-for-More-Maidens-201845822) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Snow Boobs**It was a late afternoon in December when a young woman was taking a walk through the park. Flakes danced around her nose as she walked over the snow-clad path, smiling at the white scenery around her. The branches of the trees were buckling under the weight of the snow, while the usually lush and green lawn was hidden beneath an at least two inch deep layer of snow. The path the woman was walking on wasn't quite as snowed, but her large winter boots still left deep imprints behind her. While it wasn't pitch-black the lanterns on each side of the path were already shining, their light reflecting in the surrounding snow, and with each minute th](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Snow-Boobs-275240349)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Milk for a Maiden**"Man, what an old-fashioned uniform!", May sighed, glancing at her black house-maiden dress and white apron. In her long, curly hair, she wore a white maiden cap, while black high-heels and white socks covered her feet. "Well, at least the skirt is short." Cleaning the kitchen table, the brunette then saw a bottle of milk. "Hey, milk!", she said, grabbing the bottle. "If my new boss pays me so lousy, he can't complain if I drink some of his milk."

**Bikini Body**"Okay, I've added the cat-ears. Now, do you think I'd look better with a bunny nose or a bird beak?" The 22-year old college girl shifted a little on her couch so she could hold her pencil better, while making a few alterations on the semi-anthropomorphic sketch of herself. Between her right shoulder and ear she was holding a telephone from which she impatiently awaited a reply. Meanwhile, the other occupant of the couch looked up at her with a similarly impatient look in her eyes. "I swear I've already fed you twice today, Mitty", she told her begging pet.  All the black cat responded was "meow" before getting up and jumping off th](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Bikini-Body-251846519)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**A Witchy Accident**"Lalala-lala~♪"  
  
The lovely voice of a young lady echoed through the bathroom, filling it with a cheerful melody. Inside a full bathtub the source of the music, a young woman in her early twenties was taking a bath, chirping this little tune while she thoroughly rubbed some foam over her leg. The water pearled off her skin as she stretched her leg into the air, reflecting the light of the ceiling lamp and the full moon that was shining through the window. "Ah, there's nothing like a hot bath", the woman sighed. The tips of her purple hair sunk into the water as she put her head back a little and glided a little deeper into the bathtub.](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/A-Witchy-Accident-272934324) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Curse of the Dark Maiden**Once upon a time in a world that is not ours, there was a dark, deserted wasteland far away from any kind of civilisation. In the most outside corner of that wasteland stood a huge, rocky mountain, surrounded by an eternal thunderstorm. No sunshine ever reached the ground there � the only plants that grew here were dead trees and grey grass. Truly, it was the most unpleasant place in the entire world, a place no human would have ever wanted to live at. Nevertheless, a big Gothic castle had been built on top of that mountain, seemingly inhabited aside from the swarms of night creatures that resided here.  
  
But behind its crumbling walls a](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Curse-of-the-Dark-Maiden-200175137) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Short and Sweet**Lilly wasn't really a snoopy girl. But when she coincidentally witnessed as her mother received a package at the garden gate from the postman, and then went back into the house, acting all secret as if she wanted nobody to see her bringing some package into the house, and when Lilly afterwards spotted her putting a load of red bonbons from the package into a jar that she hid on top of the highest shelf in the kitchen, it was enough to make the short girl move a chair under said shelf, put a pile of books on top of it and step onto the books to reach for the jar.  
  
"Come on", Lilly murmured. She raised herself on the very tips of her toes, stre](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Short-and-Sweet-306536048)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Phone Call BE**"I can't believe this guy!"  
  
Amanda shut the door behind her, all small objects in her apartment shaking at the impact. "How he can turn down me, Amanda Manor, the probably hottest girl in entire high school!? I prepared so hard for this: I made my hair for two hours, tanned my skin in the solar studio and put on the smallest, tightest jeans skirt I could fit in!" Putting her hands into her tank-top she pulled two bundles of cotton out of her bra, reducing her cup-size to a modest B. "I even stuffed my bra more than usually", she sighed. "Now how shall I get a date until Friday?"  
  
After throwing the cotton away she grabbed her telephone, push](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Phone-Call-BE-187436187)

 There weren't many people who could open a door with their feet, but Amanda was one of them.  
  
Holding the key between her toes the young woman put it into the keyhole, bending a little backwards. She had to be careful nothing would fall out of the box she was carrying in her arms. �That was a good day", she said to herself, looking at all the plastic items, cans and other garbage she had collected. �I can make a lot out of this stuff!"   
  
With little effort she tilted the key around, opening the door. Her apartment looked like one would expect it from a 24-year old woman, maybe a bit larger than the average. The greatest difference between Amanda's apartment and any other woman's however was not the size, but the unique decoration she had put into it: All over the room sculptures were scattered, mostly portraying women in dubious poses with unnaturally large breasts. Some of them were not larger than a fingernail, while others were above life-size. They were all made out of garbage like plastic bottles, metal cans or even gum paper, and painted in the most glaring colours.  
  
After throwing her key into the room � she could pick it up later � Amanda slipped back into her sandal. She entered her spacious apartment, closed the door with a swing of her hip, then went straight to the TV table. Going down on her knees she put the box in her arms onto the glass plate, the only surface in the room free from any sculpture. �Now let's see what we got here", she said, searching through the box. Though her hair was rather short, some of the blond strands still fell onto her rectangle glasses. Repeatedly she tried to blow them out of her sight while she put rusty cans, broken blanks and other rubbish out of the box to her right side, onto her pile for useful stuff. The whole time she was murmuring to herself, making comments about each item like �I can use this for a leg" or �This would look great if painted pink."  
  
The pile for useless stuff to her left side stayed empty as usual.    
  
Browsing the box's contents Amanda spotted a milk bottle on the bottom. �Ah, there you are!", she exclaimed, pulling it out of the box. She had been searching for an intact milk bottle like this for weeks with no luck, but today had finally found one on her daily route through the city dumps. �But you're a little dirty, aren't you?" she noted, taking a handkerchief out of her large trousers. As she rubbed the dirt off from the bottle, Amanda believed to see a small pink gleam inside it. �Is there something?", she wondered, pulling the bottle closer to her face. There seemed to be a small gem inside, or at least a splitter of glass. While she was staring through the glass, another pink gleam appeared on top of the bottle.   
  
Amanda's eyes then grew very wide as she saw that pink smoke was steaming out of it.   
  
With a loud shriek Amanda dropped the bottle, quickly crawling away from it. The pink smoke continued to ascend into the air, slowly forming a spiral cloud. Just as no more smoke came out a bright flash suddenly enlightened the entire room, blinding Amanda for a second.   
  
Once she regained her sight she thought to be hallucinating.  
  
Above the table, right inside her apartment, a dark-skinned woman was floating through the air. Her black hair was tied into a long ponytail, a big strand covering her right eye. Golden rings, one shaped as the sun and the other one as the moon hung from her ears, which for some reason were nor round, but pointy, like those of elves from generic fantasy stories. With her wide yellow pantaloons, pink banana shoes and the small purple top, this woman looked like she came from the ancient Orient. She seemed to be around Amanda's age, and was quite pretty as she found, having a clean face in company to a decently shaped body.   
  
Her left eye was looking down on Amanda, glaring at her in a mixture of boredom, annoyance, and to a certain degree, apathy. �I am the genie from the milk bottle!", the woman began to speak, sounding like she had to force the words out of her mouth. �As a sign of gratitude for freeing me from my bottle, I shall grant thee three wishes!� And so on and so forth, you know this all from the movies."  
  
Amanda was still sitting on the ground, staring open-mouthed at her strange visitor. It took a while before she regained her speech: �Y-you're the genie from the�um, milk bottle?"  
  
�Yeah, from the milk bottle." The woman put her hands on her hips. �My lamp broke, and I didn't want to live on the street, 'kay?"  
  
The situation was overcharging Amanda. She shook her head, took her glasses off, cleaned them, rubbed her eyes, even slammed her hand against her forehead.   
  
No matter what she did though, the floating woman didn't disappear.    
  
Slowly, Amanda stood up again, putting her glasses back on her face. �Wow� So you are-?"  
  
�Yes, I am a real genie", the woman interrupted her �You can believe your eyes. Now could we get to business already? I have an eternity to spend."  
  
Though Amanda was still dazzled, her mind slowly began to digest the situation. �Amazing", she whispered, unable to take her eyes off the unusually clothed visitor. �Is that silk?"  
  
�Polyester. Silk's a pain to wash."  
  
�Oh... but couldn't you just clean it with your magic?"  
  
�Oh yeah, of course." The genie rolled her eyes. �We genies don't need washing machines or other inventions to make our life more comfortable. We have nothing better to do then cast spells all day, cause it's sooo simple to bend reality and break the laws of nature."  
  
�S-sorry", Amanda stuttered, blushing slightly. There was an uncomfortable silence. The genie inspected her pink finger-nails, while the young artist looked up to her with gleaming eyes. �So� you can grant me any wish I want?", she finally asked.  
  
�Pretty much", the genie replied. �As long as it doesn't involve anything impossible, illegal, or spinach."   
  
Amanda frowned. �Spinach?"  
  
�Long story, little time." The genie then noticed Amanda still stared at her in wonder. �Please, could you snap out of the 'Oh my god, it's a genie!'-phase already and state your first wish? I'd like to go back into my bottle and finish my manicure."  
  
Now that the shock faded, her guest's unfriendly behavior started to annoy Amanda. �Well, first I wish you would be a little bit more friendly!"  
  
The genie sighed. �Oh great, looks like I stumbled into an incredibly sensitive master..."   
  
�Didn't you hear what I said about 'friendly'?"  
  
�And didn't you hear what I said about 'impossible'?"  
  
Again silence, this time mixed with tension. �Why are you in such a bad mood?", Amanda finally asked, crossing her arms before her chest.  
  
The genie didn't reply at first, staring down at her master with dark eyes(or rather one dark eye, the other one was still hidden behind her hair). �Sorry, I didn't want to be mean", she suddenly apologized to Amanda. Her voice had this lethargic undertone again. �It's just this whole genie-business always goes the same: First, you state a wish for something totally trivial and unimportant, either because you don't believe I'm a genie, haven't realized your possibilities yet, or are just stupid. Then comes an exceptionally selfish or selfless wish, like world peace, fame or money, and you enjoy for a while what seems a perfect life to you. But when you stumble into the first problems, when things are a little off from what you expected � bada-bing!, you wish you had never found me, and I wait another couple of centuries until the next mortal finds me and repeats the circle." She wasn't looking at Amanda anymore, but stared with empty eyes into the distance. �I've been granting wishes for more than three thousand years, but there isn't one that still effects the world: Columbus really found America instead of India, Napoleon chose not to rule the entire world forever, Einstein didn't turn into a genius�"  
  
�Huh? But Einstein WAS a genius."  
  
�You should have seen the guy before he took his wish back." Back in her cynicism the genie looked down at Amanda again. �So, what's *your* ridiculous first wish?", she asked. �A sandwich? Some giddy toy? Or since you're seem to be an artis-"  
  
�Grow your boobs!"  
  
There was an odd pause again, Amanda's word hanging in the room. �Eeeeeexcuse me?", the genie asked, raising an eye-brow.  
  
�You know, your breasts!" Amanda put her hands on her small chest, cupping it slightly. �Tits, milkjugs, melons, whatever you call them - just make them bigger!"  
  
For the first time in centuries the genie was lacking a response. �I shall turn myself into a blown-up barbie-doll?", she eventually brought out.  
  
�Yes!� Well, you don't need to overdo it", Amanda quickly added, noting the genie was glancing at some of her sculptures. �Keep it at something manageable, but still above the average. Oh, and make yourself as sexy as possible: Round and full with a firm hold, but soft to every touch, and very bouncy!"   
  
The genie didn't move a muscle, staring absently at her master. For a second, Amanda feared she had overdone it, and that she would be turned her into a pile of dust. After a while though, the genie slowly lifted her arms up to her chest. �As� thy wish."  
  
Clapping her hands together the genie closed her eyes, Amanda watching as a golden twinkle surrounded the spirit's body. A warm feeling build up inside the genie's chest, while at the same time hr whole body was shivering slightly. Moved by an unseen force her breasts suddenly began to rise up, gradually turning firmer. Her whole bosom prickled as it slowly lifted itself up, the strong stand creating a small cleavage. As her modest mounds reached their maximal amount of firmness, a strong power surged through the genie, her stern expression slightly wavering at the upcoming sensations.   
  
Sighing at the dullness of her situation the genie then felt her already form-fitting top was growing tighter, the pressure inside it gradually rising. Wide-eyed Amanda watched as two rounding bulks appeared beneath the genie's clothes, the short top rising even higher as it was filling with flesh. In addition to its size the genie, felt her chest's sensitivity was also increasing, sending goose-bumps over her skin. With clenched teeth she tried to choke the feeling down, concentrating on the visual effects of her spell: Inch after inch was added to her bustline, the genie sporting a pair of full grapefruits after a few seconds. The neck-hole of her top was steadily pulled down, bit by bit uncovering her ballooning meat buns. Slightly at first, then more and more noticeable the two women could hear the genie's top being stretched, its purple fabric turning paler the larger her bust grew. Accompanying the cleavage her breasts now started to look out at the sides of her top as well, showing off the firm roundings of her bosom.   
  
Amanda's attention was completely drawn to the genie's growing rack, the young woman watching as the top overflew with flesh. Her eyes were itching, but she refused to blink even once in fear of missing anything. As the top continued to tighten around her body Amanda noticed the genie was making a painful face. Gulping down the spit in her mouth she wanted to ask if everything was all right. Before Amanda could say a word though a loud snap suddenly echoed through the room: The genie's massive knockers jolted a little inside their small hold, her cleavage abruptly increasing while a pink holder fell out below her rising top.  
  
�Genies wear bras?", Amanda asked in surprise.  
  
�No, we let our breasts sag cause we like stiff shoulders", the genie responded, pulling the bra out of her top. A pair of healthy double D's greeted her as she looked down on herself, growing ever larger. Including their sides she guessed about 40 to 50 percent of her breasts were revealed, tendency rising. Her top was so ridiculously tight, one could have mistaken it for her skin, the fabric rising up towards her bosom. Nearing its limits the first seams started to give in, slowly dissolving at the area around her nipples. Glancing over to her master, the genie could see her� �enjoyment" increasing the lighter her cover became, her eyes nearly popping out of her head.   
  
This couldn't go on like this: Wish or not, she wasn't a zoo animal people could gawk at! Seeing Amanda was still focused on her bosom, the genie secretly clapped her hands behind her back. A slight sparkle surrounded her top, the strained fabric changing to a more elastic material. �Did you just do something?" Amanda asked, looking sceptically at the (slightly) looser top.   
  
Again the genie clapped her hands. �Just added a little firmness", she replied, her chest slightly sparkling beneath her top. Invisible to Amanda a new bra formed around the genie's chest, cupping her soft assets. With the new support the stiffness in the genie's shoulders began to weaken, a small smile hushing over her face. It quickly vanished though as the strain in her top reminded her she was still blowing up, her breasts nearing the size of her head. The bottom ends of her top and breasts mutually approached each other, the genie watching in fear her breasts would soon look out from below her top as well.   
  
She could almost feel the load falling off her mind as the growth slowed down, until finally coming to a halt. Another huge relief was that despite the enormous size of her breasts, her head still remained the largest part of her body, though the difference was rather slim. Between the holders of her top a large V-neck displayed cleavage down to the middle of her bosom, while on its sides one could take a generous glance at her ample roundings. She could not see beyond her enormous bustline, but the genie felt her top was ending just below her breasts � it would probably take little to lift it up. Her theory was then proving right as she took in a deep breath, creating a small under-cleavage in the process, before her top sunk back after she let out an exaggeratedly long sigh.   
  
�This easily tops all first wishes I ever granted", the genie mourned. Taking her eyes off her disgustingly blown-up bosom she glanced over to her master, who seemed like she could explode in joy any second. �There! I've turned myself into a bimbo, just like you wished. Now speak out your other two wishes so I can go back to normal!"  
  
Staring at the genie with lustful eyes a mischievous smile spread over Amanda's face. �Patience, my dear, patience�" The young artist walked over to the table, the genie watching as she stepped on it. Looking up, Amanda saw the spirit was still a few feet ahead of her. �Come closer!", she demanded. The genie sunk down, until her breasts were directly in front of Amanda's face. �Wow, can you read minds?", Amanda asked, liking what she saw.  
  
�Theoretically I could, but it wasn't really hard to guess what you want." Hovering before her eyes the genie let Amanda get a close-up view on her vast cleavage, rolling her eyes as the young artist almost stuck her nose between her breasts. She threw them right back on her though as a pair of hands touched her bosom. �H-hey, wh-what are you doing?", the genie yelled, watching and feeling as her master stroke her chest.   
  
Amanda grinned up to the startled genie. �Just checking you didn't cheat", she replied, the spirit wincing a little as Amanda's hands slipped below her top. Instead of touching a firm pair of breasts though Amanda's, fingers were sliding over even more fabric. 'When did she summon that?', Amanda wondered while she dug her hands beneath the bra. Finally she got a grip on the genie's glorious orbs, and felt their gorgeous firmness with her own hands. Moving her fingers proved to be quite a challenge under those tight clothes, but she managed enough motions on the full spheres to arouse their holder a little. �Seems like you pass the firmness test", Amanda giggled. �But are you soft  to every touch?"   
  
Opening her mouth the genie wanted to say something, but Amanda already pressed her hands into the mighty mounds. The mammary flesh poured over every side of the genie's purple top, Amanda's fingers sinking deeply into the luscious meat. Instead of a sarcastic comment a moan slipped through the genie's lips, her whole body twitching under the numerous sensations. The moment Amanda softened her grip the genie gasped in relief, her bust swaying in her master's hands as she tried to catch her breath.   
  
�Hehe, now who's the sensitive one?", Amanda chuckled, removing her hands from the spirit.   
  
The genie flew back a little, looking not very amused. �I see the master has a sense of humour that fits her obscure fantasies", she remarked, adjusting her top.   
  
Amanda just stuck out her tongue with a smile, so far content with the results of her tests. �Okay, next the bounciness: Jump!"  
  
Nothing happened.  
  
�Um, I said ju-ump � and don't bring that impossible joke again!"  
  
�Sadly, that's just what it is: Sorry if you didn't notice yet, but my body doesn't follow the laws of gravity. How shall I jump when I already float through the air?"  
  
Amanda pondered about this for a moment. �Good point� Oh well, then we have to do this the old way!" A sly grin on her face Amanda jumped forward, grabbing the genie's shoulders as she bumped into her. Taken by surprise the genie was thrown backwards, so both women were falling towards the ground. She hit the floor forcefully with her back, groaning in pain, while Amanda landed on top of her. She was shoved right into the spirit's boobs, contently noting the wobbling meat balls were bouncing against her face through the fabric. Amanda pulled her head out, smiling as she watched them jiggle. �Yep, you held your word!"   
  
After Amanda got back on her feet the genie lifted herself into the air again, putting a hand on her back. �You're lucky the genie codex forbids me to harm my master in any way, except he wishes for it."  
  
Amanda just giggled, smiling upon the genie's massively sexy bust. �All right, now it's my turn!"  
  
�Turn for what?", the genie asked, pulling her top down again. A thought then crossed her mind. �Wait, you mean�?"  
  
Amanda nodded, pointing her chest out. �Exactly!", she said. "I just wanted to test it on you to see how it looks. Also," she added a little sheepishly, �I heard genies are quite mischievous, so I was scared you'd do god-knows-what to me when I state my wish."   
  
�Which I wouldn't do to myself, of course", the genie concluded.  
  
 �You got it!", the young woman grinned, showing her perfectly white teeth. �Make mine just like yours, only a little bit bigger � and by 'little', I mean as much as my spine can take!"   
  
If there had been ground beneath her feet, the genie would have tapped on it now. �I turned peasants into kings, put together the most unlikely love couples, even stopped some of the bloodiest wars in history, and you want me to make your breasts bigger?!"  
  
�I'm humble, okay? Now give me a killer rack already!"  
  
The genie rolled her eyes. �As thy wish.", she stated, clapping her hands. �Gosh, they're so gonna laugh at me on the next genie meeting�" she murmured to herself, while a golden twinkle surrounded her master.  
  
A pleasurable warmth settled into Amanda's bosom, the female artist shivering as it filled her entire body with delight. Closing her eyes she stretched herself like she was yawning, sticking her chest out from her body. The warmth was engulfing her entire bust, sending a bubbling prickle over it, Amanda utterly enjoying the comforting feeling.   
  
In the middle of all the cushiness a sudden heat wave emerged from her breasts, forcing a gasp out of her. Without her doing her mounds began to rise up, seemingly lifted by an unseen force. As they reached their maximal firmness another urge went through her body, triggering a flood of sensations. Her bosom began to vibrate slightly, electrified by the heat and tickling. Though it became hard fo her to think straight, a devious smile formed on Amanda's face, all concentration focused on her chest as she waited for it to�  
  
�GAH!" Throwing her head into her neck Amanda gasped once more. The rush inside her intensified, the heat in her bust becoming unbearable as it slowly began to move outwards. Eager to see her changing Amanda opened her eyes � and was quite surprised to see the genie's face hovering before hers.  
  
�Just to be on the safe side: I didn't make such a ruckus, did I?"  
  
�Nope, don't worry", Amanda laughed, feeling her breasts brush against her blouse. As the genie floated backwards Amanda's humble bustline slowly strayed off from her body, the young woman getting all giggly. Her top's loose fabric evened under her rising curvature, while the first folds of flesh began to roll out of her bra. She thought about taking it off for a second, but then she would miss the fun of blasting it off. Filling her blouse Amanda's modest mounds swelled through the citrus fruit zone, each additional pound widening the smile on her face. With gentle hands she cupped her breasts, goose-bumps forming on her arms as the fresh flesh flew into her palms, pushing them outwards. Though her bra and top hindered a direct contact, she could already feel the genie's magic working on her body, her breasts being alluringly firm while staying soft to her touch. The sensitivity caused her to thrum on her breasts, each little beat sending a small tingle through her body.   
  
Unable to resist any longer Amanda fastened her grip, enjoying the feel of growth. Carefully and slowly she pushed her fingers into her little softballs, bruising the cups of her bra. Under their hard shell she could feel her bosom being squeezed by her hands, the small prickle multiplying in Amanda's mind, up to the point where she began to moan softly.   
  
The genie just shook her head.  
  
Letting go of her bust Amanda felt it slightly sway inside her top, noticing her chest had successfully filled her blouse out. Growing fuller and rounder her breasts were stretching the fabric of her blouse, steadily widening the gaps between her buttons. Meanwhile, large folds of flesh pourred over her bra, tightly pulling against its lock. 'Can't be long now' Amanda thought, seeing her way too small cups were holding back the progress of her bustline. The more flesh tried to escape the harder her bra dug into her back. The pressure was growing stronger and stronger, slowly suffocating Amanda as she gasped for air, lost in a mixture of pleasure and pain, trying to stay focused for the moment when�  
  
Like from an distant place Amanda heard her own moan filling the room, drowning the snap of her bra. Staring up to the ceiling she felt the flesh streaming into her top, pushing its buttons to the limit. Each of her breasts had just exploded to the diameter of CDs, the gaps in her blouse wide enough for some cleavage. The new freedom caused her bosom to bounce in glee, not too heavily, but also not slightly, moving the broken bra that was stuck in her top.   
  
Amanda panted a little as she caught her breath, but immediately gasped again once the button in the middle of her chest popped off. The genie watched it land on the ground, rolling around the room, while Amanda concentrated on the overflowing gap at the center of her bosom. With a lot more pressure her meaty pillows tried to escape through the small hole, their round shape growing more and more defined despite their severe limitations. Having no more room to grow into her breasts squeezed strongly against each other, the valley in her cleavage evening until it almost formed a line. On the point where her top was about to break apart the next button flew off with a bounce, granting Amanda another boob boost. Aside from more cleavage, now a part of her bra could also be seen inside the hole on her front. Amanda giggled at how tiny the cups now seemed in comparison to her breasts, looking ever smaller as her bosom continued to blow up.   
  
Meanwhile, the genie had began to circle around Amanda, fighting a little with her new form. She watched her master's growth from every ankle, the side view granting an especially impressive sight on her proportions. As she floated behind Amanda, the genie could hear the next button popping off and remained for a moment: From the back, she could see Amanda's breasts lapping over her body, the firm roundings standing proudly to the side. Gulping a little she saw her master was still a bit smaller than her, a thought that caused the genie to glance down her own body. 'This is disgraceful!', she thought, her dark-skinned orbs straining her top with each breath. Whenever she took in too much air they pushed her top far enough for the fabric to rise above her bosom's bottom, which was quite often the case now as she was breathing rather hard in her anger.   
  
Usually, she was too bored to play pranks on humans or �mistake" their wishes - but this time, she really, *really* wanted to pay this woman back! Raising her head again the genie guessed Amanda must have been roughly at her size by now. �As much as my spine can take" � the words still echoed through the genie's mind. Actually, she had intended to make her stop slightly above head-size.   
  
Now that she closely examined Amanda's back though, the genie found it looked very robust.   
  
'Well, she wished for it, and I have to obey.' Once more the genie rose her arms, smiling like she hadn't done in hundreds of years. 'I sure hope she hurries with her last wish though', she thought, feeling a small jiggle when she clapped her hands.  
  
Though Amanda didn't take notice of the golden twinkle around her, she immediately felt it when her breasts suddenly grew faster, quickly conquering her front. The last button bid its farewell, sending out another wave of flesh that blew her top up. The open blouse was forming a wide V-neck, even deeper than the genie's, the space in it still cramped enough for her breasts to squeeze each other. As the pure orbs grew through the sports ball assortment, even their firmness couldn't make up for the weight they had packed on, slowly dragging Amanda forward. Leaning in a little the young artist put her hands under her bosom for support, but the sheer touch alone almost made her moan again. Fast and hard she dug her hands into the fabric, pushing her already revealing top over her nipples, while countless sensations overwhelmed her body.   
  
Soundly enjoying the situation Amanda fell on her knees, feeling her breasts vibrate inside her palms. She tore her blouse completely apart so nothing would cover her full milk melons anymore, then put her hands right on top of them. Licking her lips, Amanda began to *really* enjoy her situation, up to the point where even the genie looked away with a blush. And her breasts still continued to expand, slowly overtaking G- and H-cups, going beyond the largest a woman could naturally grow to.Yet they kept their unbelievable firm- and roundness, the massive spheres starting to block Amanda's sight. Soon, she couldn't reach around them anymore, her hands slipping off as she desperately continued to grope herself. The swelling pounds also forced her steadily forward, her whole body shivering at the tormenting weight(and some other things).   
  
In a last streak of reason, Amanda turned herself towards the TV table. She dropped her monstrous mammaries on the glass plate, throwing the rest of her body on top of them. Wobbling on her cleavage Amanda let her tongue hang out, feeling as the swelling spheres pushed her body up. The larger she grew, the more crunched the table under her weight, something Amanda couldn't hear though under own moans. The first cracks appeared as she entered beach ball size, Amanda being more breast than human by that point. Her body was already pushed off from top of her breasts, resting mostly on her knees again.   
  
One last time she pushed her hands into the soft flesh, squeezing her bosom to a hourglass shape. A flood of tingling, prickling, tickling and thrilling sensations nearly forced Amanda unconscious, and a serious of increasingly louder moans out of her mouth. Once she released her grip on them the massive mounds rebound, the flesh bouncing all over the table, while the genie held her ears from the sound level her master produced.    
  
As the sensation passed its climax Amanda let her head fall into her cleavage, panting from exhaustion. She felt her face getting slowly swallowed between her blowing breasts, the soft skin brushing against her cheeks. After a few seconds though she didn't sink any deeper, and figured her growth must have stopped. Raising her head a little she looked over her mammal mountains, for the first time realising the new dimensions of her body: She was truly enormous, beyond anything somebody could even achieve with a surgery, the bustiest woman in the world � and at the time the firmest, roundest, softest and bounciest. With a hard gulp she rose herself up a little, catching some breath to speak. �Wow� didn't know my spine could take SO much."  
  
The genie hovered in front of her master's breasts, quietly examining her work �We genies take commands very literally" she eventually remarked, floating back from the beanbag bosom. With a hint of remorse in her voice she added: �Though I really may have taken it a bit over the top�"   
  
�Oh, I'm not angry or anything." Beyond her vast bustline, the genie saw her master was patting her breasts, a wide smile on the face. � In fact, I feel pretty darn good - thanks!"  
  
The genie felt to be struck by lightning. �Craziest. Master. Ever.", she finally said, looking at her master in disbelief.  
  
Amanda put her head between her breasts, caressing them like a new-born baby. �Us artists tend to be eccentric � you got a problem with that?"  
  
�No no, I'm sorry." Floating on her back the genie crossed her legs, putting her hands behind her head. �I'll just be quiet and wait until you wish never you had never found me."  
  
�Yeah, sure!", the young woman laughed. �Like that'll ever�"  
  
A loud crack suddenly interrupted her, Amanda feeling as she fell forward. The table beneath her was breaking apart, erasing the last boundary between her bosom and the ground. Quickly the genie clapped her hands, making Amanda immune to the splitters. After falling a foot deep her breasts hit the floor, the splintering glass simply bouncing of her skin.   
  
Speaking off bouncing: I guess you can all imagine what happened as she landed.  
  
�So, you wanna go back to normal already?", the genie asked, watching her master go up and down.   
  
It took almost a minute until Amanda's body had come to rest, now only moving from her constant breathing. �Nah, I think I'll just wish for a new table", she giggled. Amanda tried to stand up, but hadn't even rose herself an inch before she was back wobbling on her bosom. �Okay, maybe make them a little smaller - but this time, I *mean* little!"

Danke sehr! Ja, ich hab versucht die Geschichte mit einem leichten Augenzwinkern zu versehen, einfach weil die Thematik etwas abgedroschen ist.

Fantastic breast growth description, and the interaction between the girl and the genie as personalities isn't bad either.

[:iconfaestock:](http://faestock.deviantart.com/) `[faestock](http://faestock.deviantart.com/) is one of our best known and popular deviants from the Stock and Resources community. Her gallery is filled to the brim with high quality stock photographs that have inspired deviants to get creative, and turn the already beautiful images into something magical. Jessica always takes time to reach out to deviants, providing contests and nurturing other artists. We're inspired by her selfless attitude and dedication to a genre that we couldn't create without. It's with great pleasure that we award the Deviousness Award for September 2013 to `[faestock](http://faestock.deviantart.com/), congratulations.  [Read More](http://today.deviantart.com/)

**The genie from the milk bottle**There weren't many people who could open a door with their feet, but Amanda was one of them.  
  
Holding the key between her toes the young woman put it into the keyhole, bending a little backwards. She had to be careful nothing would fall out of the box she was carrying in her arms. �That was a good day", she said to herself, looking at all the plastic items, cans and other garbage she had collected. �I can make a lot out of this stuff!"  
  
With little effort she tilted the key around, opening the door. Her apartment looked like one would expect it from a 24-year old woman, maybe a bit larger than the average. The greatest difference be](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/The-genie-from-the-milk-bottle-196457100)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**A Witchy Accident**"Lalala-lala~♪"  
  
The lovely voice of a young lady echoed through the bathroom, filling it with a cheerful melody. Inside a full bathtub the source of the music, a young woman in her early twenties was taking a bath, chirping this little tune while she thoroughly rubbed some foam over her leg. The water pearled off her skin as she stretched her leg into the air, reflecting the light of the ceiling lamp and the full moon that was shining through the window. "Ah, there's nothing like a hot bath", the woman sighed. The tips of her purple hair sunk into the water as she put her head back a little and glided a little deeper into the bathtub.](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/A-Witchy-Accident-272934324) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**In retrospect...**Sarah stared into her glass, blushing slightly. With the straw she drew circles on the surface of her juice, nervously shifting around on her chair. �Sooo, how do you feel?", she asked, not looking up from her glass.  
  
�Like a milk-cow", the woman next to her said. Around them, Sarah could hear the whispers of the other guests at the street caf�, constantly glaring over to their table. People passing on the street gazed towards them, their eyes nearly popping out of their heads. �You know, one of those genetically modified with the fat udders."  
  
Silently, Sarah took a sip from her orange juice � coincidentally, &#](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/In-retrospect-202581465)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**More Milk for More Maidens**"Aren't you done changing yet, April?", Victoria yelled from the kitchen. As her younger co-worker didn't reply she sighed. "Man, first day in our first job, and she can't even get into her uniform." Lowering her green eyes the tall girl looked at the clothes she wore: A short black dress alongside a white apron and matching boots. There was also a white maiden's cap tucked into her short crimson hair. "The chief maiden will be here any moment", she mumbled. "Said something about a "special test" on the phone. And that butler just gave us our uniforms and told us to go straight into the kitchen once we have changed � the rich surely are](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/More-Milk-for-More-Maidens-201845822) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Milk for a Maiden**"Man, what an old-fashioned uniform!", May sighed, glancing at her black house-maiden dress and white apron. In her long, curly hair, she wore a white maiden cap, while black high-heels and white socks covered her feet. "Well, at least the skirt is short." Cleaning the kitchen table, the brunette then saw a bottle of milk. "Hey, milk!", she said, grabbing the bottle. "If my new boss pays me so lousy, he can't complain if I drink some of his milk." Opening it, she emptied the bottle with a few gulps, ignoring the warning label "FROM GENETICALLY MODIFIED COWS � MAY CAUSE SWELLINGS ON SOME PERSONS".  
  
Just as she put the bottle down again, M](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Milk-for-a-Maiden-166103544)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Phone Call BE**"I can't believe this guy!"  
  
Amanda shut the door behind her, all small objects in her apartment shaking at the impact. "How he can turn down me, Amanda Manor, the probably hottest girl in entire high school!? I prepared so hard for this: I made my hair for two hours, tanned my skin in the solar studio and put on the smallest, tightest jeans skirt I could fit in!" Putting her hands into her tank-top she pulled two bundles of cotton out of her bra, reducing her cup-size to a modest B. "I even stuffed my bra more than usually", she sighed. "Now how shall I get a date until Friday?"  
  
After throwing the cotton away she grabbed her telephone, push](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Phone-Call-BE-187436187)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**30k Birthday Celebration**There wasn't really much to associate with the number 30. One of the bloodiest wars in history lasted 30 years, some months have 30 days, and according to Wikipedia there was a band called "30 Odd foot of grunts", but it really isn't a special number. So as Gina turned into the driveway of her home she told herself it was no big deal today was her 30th birthday.  
  
Gina parked in front of her garage, looking at the clock before she shut down the engine. 7pm � it had really been a long day of work. Not that she minded it, she liked her work. And that way, she was able to distract herself a little. Her colleagues had also made it easy for he](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/30k-Birthday-Celebration-268587999)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**A Hardware Upgrade**Since she was a child Jean had always loved flying. Though it was over twenty years ago she could still remember the first time when she had entered a plane. She was so nervous she had hold tightly to the arm of her mother the entire time on the airport, and once they sat inside immediately grabbed the leans of her seat. When the plane took off she almost screamed, and couldn't calm down until the signs for the seatbelts had gone off. But as she dared a look outside the window after a while and stared at the sea of white fluffy clouds and the beautiful landscape beneath the plane all her fear was immediately replaced with utter awe.

**Curse of the Holy Maiden**A long time ago, in a world that is not ours, there was a deserted wasteland far away from any kind of civilization. For centuries this country had laid abandoned, avoided by any kind of life form except for some creatures that dwelled in the dark. One day a young princess of darkness and her nefarious servant came to this unholy land in search of an exile. From the wrecking ruins of an old castle located on a mountain at the edge of this forsaken country that Dark Maiden had begun to build up an evil empire. One by one she conquered the neighbouring kingdoms without the use of any armies or weapons(at least not in the traditional sense).

**April's Big Day**April's Big Day  
  
April was cleaning around the house since she was going to have company over today. She had met a woman named Sabrina not very long ago, and had invited her over for lunch. April figured it'd be a good way to get to know more about Sabrina.  
  
Two of April's friends, Clara and Katrina, had introduced her to Sabrina the other day. The cool thing about Clara and Katrina was that they were witches, and could pretty much do anything they wanted; they were also twins.  
  
April had to admit though, that she did have this one thought about kissing Clara; she wondered what it'd be like. Clara was extremely cute and was ve](http://blueberryjanelle.deviantart.com/art/April-s-Big-Day-191673895)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Fun With BE**Fun With BE  
  
Jess sighed and tilted her head back onto the pillow. "I'm so bored!"  
  
I looked at her. "Well, can you think of anything you'd want to do?" Jess got up and smiled. "Hehe, I got something we can do." Jess giggled. I rolled my eyes. "Haha, maybe later tonight, sweetie." I bent over to put some clothes on the bottom drawer of my dresser. Jess smiled and stared at my ass, my shorts stretching themselves slightly around my ass cheeks proudly.  
  
Suddenly, there was a burst of smoke on the other side of the room. A figure was hidden in the mist. "HEY!" "Clara! It's you!" Jess ran over and gave her a hug. "It's awesome being a witch. Like](http://blueberryjanelle.deviantart.com/art/Fun-With-BE-159114929)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Kylie's Gummy Situation**Kylie's Gummy Situation  
  
Kylie looked around in search for the twins. She already knew that Clara had gone out for an afternoon stroll, and that Katrina would be back shortly after she had some business to take care of (whatever that may have been). She talked to them both on the phone before they left, and about twenty minutes had passed since she had spoken with them.  
  
"How long have they been gone for? I can't wait outside their house all day!" Kylie wiped the sweat from her forehead as the sun beat down on it. "Why is it so friggin' hot, anyways!?"  
  
Kylie stood at the front door until she got an idea. She jogged to the back of](http://blueberryjanelle.deviantart.com/art/Kylie-s-Gummy-Situation-210695077)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Voluptuous Arousal**Voluptuous Arousal  
  
"Hey, Janelle. Welcome back. How was your afternoon jog?"  
  
"Hey, Sabrina. It was alright," I closed the front door and headed into the kitchen. "How long have you been here waiting?"  
  
Sabrina crossed her long smooth legs, "Maybe about fifteen minutes? Brad said you'd be back soon. Oh, and he told me to tell you that he went off to some hardware store."  
  
I wiped the sweat from my forehead, "To replace one of the old door knobs for the guest room?"  
  
"How the hell am I supposed to know? All he said was that he'd be back soon. Also, he said he might stop at some sporting goods store."  
  
"Oh. Okay, then."

**A Stroll Through The Park**A Stroll Through The Park  
  
Pandora walked down the street casually on a bright sunny day. The sky was blue and there was no cloud in sight. Being on a different planet was a bit different than what she was used to, considering planet Earth was so unique in many ways.  
  
Of course, being an alien princess wasn't easy, either. Pandora had already learned thousands of languages, and every now and then a new alien race would evolve and she would have to learn yet another language. But it didn't really bother her. She was adored by the trillions on her home planet, and everyone loved her. Her mother and father were king and queen, so someday](http://blueberryjanelle.deviantart.com/art/A-Stroll-Through-The-Park-213749180)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Jenny's Busty Surprise**Jenny's Busty Surprise  
  
Jenny was in the kitchen of her apartment preparing dinner. Ever since she had graduated high school, she finally started to feel more responsibilities as life came towards her. Although she was only nineteen tears old, she had a pretty decent job that paid good money. Living in an apartment was okay for her as she didn't have to pay a whole lot of money besides the rent and other necessities.  
  
She was always a smart girl, always above average in her classes back in high school. She had long brown hair, and had a great smile. Her cheeks had just a touch of red; almost as if she were blushing, and she had sexy lips](http://blueberryjanelle.deviantart.com/art/Jenny-s-Busty-Surprise-170338964) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Busty Desires: Part One**Busty Desires  
Part One  
  
Katrina looked up and saw us walk into the potion room. She dropped something into the cauldron, before looking back down into it, "Oh, hey. You four showed up after all."  
  
"Well, duh! We told you we'd come," Kylie rolled her eyes. "And besides, we're not like you where you just randomly show up at our houses at the most unexpected times...."  
  
Katrina's eyes looked up at Kylie, "What's that supposed to mean."  
  
"Well, both you and Clara do that. Just teleport to places randomly."  
  
"Yeah, I remember you two teleported to my bathroom when I was in the shower," I chuckled and my cheeks turned a little red.](http://blueberryjanelle.deviantart.com/art/Busty-Desires-Part-One-206953017)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**The Perfect Date**The Perfect Date  
  
Sally sat down on a park bench and waited for her boyfriend to arrive. They had agreed to meet there at about six o'clock, then after, they had planned to take a trip to the movies.  
  
Jack was always on time when it came to dates. Sally could remember this one time where Jack got caught in traffic on East Main Street, the busiest street in town. On that day, it was about noon and they had both planned to meet for lunch at a local restaurant. Jack ended up having to take a few side sides roads off of Main Street in order to get there on time (the roads weren't in the best condition, either.) He ended up having to take](http://blueberryjanelle.deviantart.com/art/The-Perfect-Date-200693598) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Annie's Endowments: Part I** Annie stood naked in front of the bedroom mirror and regarded her reflection with obvious distaste.  She put her hands on her small belly and sighed, feeling that she had been dealt a very poor hand by fate.  She had a round and winsome face, with dark hair that fell in loose curls about her shoulders.  She knew she was a little chubby, but with narrow hips, a flat butt and a modest bosom, she didn't exactly think of herself as curvy.  Rather, Annie thought as she frowned to herself, she just looked dumpy and unremarkable in all respects.  All her life, she had felt jealous of her sister, Gina, who had so effortlessly kept fit and athletic.](http://kodos11.deviantart.com/art/Annie-s-Endowments-Part-I-269942944)

*Once upon a time in a world that is not ours, there was a dark, deserted wasteland far away from any kind of civilisation. In the most outside corner of that wasteland stood a huge, rocky mountain, surrounded by an eternal thunderstorm. No sunshine ever reached the ground there � the only plants that grew here were dead trees and grey grass. Truly, it was the most unpleasant place in the entire world, a place no human would have ever wanted to live at. Nevertheless, a big Gothic castle had been built on top of that mountain, seemingly inhabited aside from the swarms of night creatures that resided here.   
  
But behind its crumbling walls a great danger was about to rise, threatening the world in a way no man would have ever been able to imagine�  
  
And even if, no one would have taken him serious�*  
  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  
  
The heavy gates to the throne room swung open, creaking miserably in their rusty hinges. Through the old door a contrarily young woman entered the hall, her long bleak hair fluttering slightly as she walked with furious steps over the ripped up red carpet. �This sucks!", she yelled, her violet eyes beaming with anger. The ashen skin of her body was covered by not more than a black leather strap tied around her chest, alongside a matching pair of black boots and small panties on her lower end. �I finally manage to find a demon lord who is capable of destroying the world, but when I arrive at his prison, a hero has already slain him!  
  
Behind her, in a solemn distance, a little black bird flew into the castle, following the path of its mistress. �I told you!", it said, the dark peak moving relatively synchronous to its words. �If we had taken the shortcut through the swamps of agony, we would have been faster!"  
  
Standing in front of her old stone throne the evil teenager turned around. �Oh, be quiet!", she shouted, dropping her cute little butt onto the seat cushion - like the rest of the castle, it was reeking and uncomfortable. "Why am I stuck with you anyway? Other villains have bats, ravens or snakes as their sidekicks, but what do I get? A canary bird!"  
  
The bird sat down on the throne's right arm rest, glaring at its mistress. �Hey, I do look evil!", it protested. �Don't you see my pitch-black feathers and gleaming red eyes?" Taking in a deep breath it fluffed up its little body, spreading its wings out as far as possible.   
  
The villainess' violet eyes examined the slightly blown-up bird. �You still look like a tweetie."  
  
Hearing her words the bird slumped down. �Tweetie", it sobbed.  
  
The young villainess gently took the feather ball into her hands, stroking its tiny head. �I'm sorry, my little companion of darkness", she softly whispered into its ear. Her lips then brushed over the neck of the small animal, the soft kiss boasting its self-confidence. �I didn't mean to hurt your feelings." As the dark maiden reached out her hand the bird flew off, chirping a gleeful tune. �I just wish one of my evil plans would finally work", she mumbled to herself. Putting her elbow on the right armrest she leaned her head onto her fist. While she watched her pet circle around her head, the villainess bumped against something with her arm. Throwing a glance at the armrest she spotted a bowl full of roasted chestnuts lying on it � cold roasted chestnuts, but still tasty looking ones.  
  
Not minding a snack she picked up a chestnut, and threw it into her mouth. The bird in the meantime had sat down on a peck next to the throne. �Don't be so harsh on yourself!", it told her. "Or  worse, on me. You're just eighteen � you still got your whole life to build up an evil empire and conquer the world."  
  
After chewing a bit on the chestnut the dark maiden gulped it down, taking another one from the bowl. �But my mother already ruled an entire country when she was fourteen!", she countered.   
  
�Yeah, because she was a princess who had murdered her entire family�"  
  
�And my father had his own arch-nemesis at my age!", she yelled. "You hear me? A friggin' arch-nemesis! Everything I got are rats pestering this ruins I call home!"  
  
�Now now, I wouldn't say the castle is in such a bad shape."   
  
A piece of the ceiling then crashed into the floor.  
  
�Oh come on, you did this on purpose!", the bird shouted upwards.  
  
Putting her legs over one armrest and her back over the other one the villainess lay sideways on her throne. �This is all so hopeless!", she mourned, putting the bowl on her belly. "I live in the most deserted place of the planet, lacking any kind of plans or weapons to take over the world � I don't even have cookies! I'm a bad bad guy! A worse guy! Or just a guy."  
  
�I favor 'guy', it describes both your lack of evilness as well as feminine curvature." The bird ducked as a chestnut flew in its direction. �But speaking of it, why don't you just hire some guys to help you out?", it asked. "There are dozens of unemployed young men in the world waiting for a job!"   
  
She put a nut between her teeth. �I dunno", she began after a while, crunching the nut. �I'd prefer to conquer the world myself. I mean anybody can build up an evil empire with the help of hundreds of underlings � where's the accomplishment in that? Also, putting my mother and all the witches in the world aside, being evil is a pretty masculine domain. I wanna show a woman is also capable of conquering the world without the help of any men."  
  
The black canary bird of doom (scientific name, or at least it says so) shrugged. �Your decision. But I swear, just set up an announcement saying a lovely young maiden of darkness searches for evil minions, and they will be swarming the place to work for you!"   
  
�Aww, that's sweet!", the evil teen smiled.   
  
�Unless you put a picture into it." This time, the nut hit.  
  
Silence fell over the hall. The only sounds came from the wind blowing through the rifts in the walls, and the villainess chewing on her chestnuts. �Those are really good!", she said after a while. �Where did you get them?"  
  
�From a suspicious looking tradesman in a black coat", the bird replied, shifting its head. "I got them for a low price since they are cursed."  
  
�Good job!", she complimented her pet, throwing another chestnut into her mouth. �We need to be careful on our expenses, especially since or income is quite--"  
  
Spitting the nut out of her mouth she returned her body to an upright position, throwing the bowl on the ground. �They are WHAT?", she screamed.   
  
�Don't worry", the bird tried to calm its pale-faced mistress. �I don't know what curse it is, but he assured me it was no lethal one."   
  
"Oh, that's a relief!", she said, rolling her eyes. "I'll be very grateful that I'm alive after I've turned into a frog, or get red spots all over my body, or� or suddenly become a good person!" That last thought send a shiver down her spine.  
  
The bird shook its head. "Now come on, how bad of a curse can be inside some chestnuts?"  
  
Before she could respond a dizziness overcame the evil youngster. �My head�", she mourned, putting a hand on her forehead. The bird watched as its mistress shifted uncomfortably around on her throne, some tears of sweat forming on her face. �Is it getting hotter in here?", she wondered, panting a little. Her sight was getting blurry, and she felt like she was losing consciousness. �Wh-what's happening?", she screamed, clenching her fingernails into the throne. Panic and fear were overcoming her, her whole body paralysed by a strange sensation that build up inside her. �Help meeeeeee-!"  
  
The dark maiden thrust her body forward, groaning from the sick feeling inside her. A bit shocked she felt her leather strap was a bit tighter than before, as if the thrust had thrown her chest forward. Even more shocked she then noticed her piece of "clothing" was getting even smaller, before she broke out in complete hysteria when realising what was going on.   
  
"W-what?" Her grey cheeks turned a little red, both her and the bird's eyes nearly popping out of their heads: The villainess' plain, even chest began to balloon out from her body, forming two small bumps inside her leather strap. Soon, the outer roundings of her freshly shaped breasts poked out beyond it, the distance between them steadily closing. The tighter the strap grew the more uncomfortable the villainess began to feel, though she also began to feel more comfortable � she couldn't really tell herself what she felt: On one hand, the leather strap was strained on her body, growing painfully small. On the other hand�  
  
"Uh�" Waggling around on the throne the dark maiden ground her teeth. More sweat formed on her body, though the heat inside it had mainly subsided. As the flesh pressed forcefully against her leather strap she felt a rising tingle coming from her chest, her blush growing deeper with each pound that was added to her bosom. At grapefruit-size she had to press her thighs together from the subtle pleasure.   
  
After a while, she could scratch the "subtle" from that sentence.   
  
Her growth then got stuck as her strap shared no more room to stretch, so the pressure inside it rapidly increased. Flesh was pouring over every of its sides, looking like her bosom tried to eat the leather up. Worse was that her breasts pressed against each other, their squeezing almost forcing a moan out of the evil maiden. Knowing she couldn't  handle much more she quickly leaned forward. She moved her hands to her back, fumbling around on the lock of her leather strap - it couldn't really be called a lock though, since it was just a bunch of strings holding the strap together.  
  
With some effort she managed to open one of the knots. Immediately her breasts shot forward, blowing up to CD-size. Her bosom wobbled up and down, but was still overgrowing her leather strap's limitations. Also, the sudden bounce did not cooperate well with her new sensitivity, the future empress feeling like she was exploding from lust. To ensure this or any other embarrassing event wouldn't happen she threw all her inner feelings out in a loud scream. The old castle shook under her intense moans, some rubbish falling off the roof and onto the dirty carpet. Her breasts showed no signs of stopping though, so her hands went back to her "lock" and removed another string.   
  
Again her breasts jolted forward, this time going up to the size of her head. The flesh lapped over her ribcage, joyfully jiggling inside its tiny cover. It was now loose enough for her bosom to keep a spherical shape, though the constant swelling hinted this wouldn't go on too long. Still feeling overwhelmed with the situation the villainess didn't dare to touch herself, staring silently into her cleavage � though she felt quite exhausted, she fought against the impulse to pant, fearing her "top" would burst off from her breathing.  
  
As she looked down on her growing rack, a strand of her hair suddenly fell out behind her ear, brushing her grey curves. Her breasts were still wobbling a little, which caused the hairs to slightly move over her bosom. Her whole body shook at the fine touch, causing the vibrations to grow stronger. Sensitive like a mimosa she believed to feel every single hair stroking over her bust, her lips quivering as she held back another moan. To make it worse, the pressure inside her strap was again rising to alarming degrees, sending both pain and pleasure through her young body.   
  
Once more her hands moved to her back, opening another string. This time, her breasts surged only slightly forward, standing at the size of big honey melons. Quickly she tucked her hair behind her ear, just in time so the bounces wouldn't hit it. Her bosom seemed squishy and soft in its jiggles, looking like a mass of gelatinous goo. But when the movements went down it didn't sag one bit on her body, the round shape of her assets perfectly visible from all ankles. She didn't really notice (or care) about any of this though: Pulling her legs towards her body � careful not to touch her breasts with them � the evil woman tried not to shiver, knowing her bust would answer to every little vibration. No matter what she did though, the fact that her breasts were still growing ensured she would eventually board the train that led to total embarrassment. It would stop at heavenly pleasure and amazing daydreams on the way, but the final destination would still be total embarrassment.  
  
Slowly, her breasts were flowing out from her body, spilling over every side of the leather. The small strap lay on her bust like a thin belt, barely able to cover a decent amount of her grey milkjugs. Her mind was short before collapsing from the sensation inside her, and her overflowing neckline was short before touching her chin: Restrained by the leather strap, her breasts looked like deformed apple pies. Hesitant at first, but then very harshly she fumble around her back once more.When she didn't manage to open a knot she just ripped the strings apart, leaving only one to hold the piece of leather together.  
  
Her liberated breast flesh fired forward, almost ripping the strap apart. A sound like that of a bass drum emerged from her falling bust, the volleyball-sized meat buns soundly bouncing up to her face. Their restless jumping and waves they sent through her body hindered the villainess to notice that her growth was slowing down considerably: The tightness of her leather strap only increased by a little, forming a slight ditch on her otherwise perfectly globular bustline. Before the bouncing had completely rolled out her expansion was already over, though it took a while before this got to her mind. Still feeling a bit labile the dark maiden could see the top of her bosom being on height with her chin, the grey mass going up and down from her breathing. Both she and the bird looked silently at her newly endowed body, completely at loss for a any words. It took a long time before the bird finally spoke up again:   
  
�Um, you got milk�"  
  
The villainess gulped. �Yeah�"   
  
�You were hit late by puberty�"  
  
�Yeah�"  
  
�You have two stunning arguments for every discussion."  
  
"Yeah�"  
  
�You could win the prize for the biggest water melons in any-"  
  
�ALL RIGHT MY BOOBS ARE HUGE, I GOT IT!" Thrown a little off by her outburst the grey girl grabbed her armrests, tilting around on her throne. �Chestnuts, my ass", she groaned. Her eyes were full of disgust as the feminist looked down on her bloated breasts. "Looks like the work of a warlock with an incredibly bad sense of humor!"  
  
�Can you move?", the bird asked.  
  
Slowly, the villainess pushed herself off from the throne, rising to her feet. �Yeah", she said, standing more or less secure on both legs. She wanted to take a step forward, but her heavy chest threw her off balance. Wavering her arms through the air she fell backwards, landing on her throne again. The impact nearly caused her breasts to jiggle out of their tiny cover. �Partly, at least", she mourned, glaring evilly at her bosom.  
  
From its perch, the bird closely examined its mistress' firm rack. �They look kind of stiff", he remarked as her breasts stopped bouncing. "Aside from their tendency to jump around at every of your moves, I mean."  
  
The villainess also noticed this. "Wait a second." A bit hesitant she rose her hands, slowly pressing them into her breasts. Numerous sensations overwhelmed her as she squished her balloon bust together. Her body felt both like it was flying up to the sky, while at the same being drowned in a deep sea. "Th-they are a little b-bit resistant", she stuttered, swallowing her lust down. "B-but in c-comparison, I g-g-guess they are s-still rather s-s-soft�"   
  
�Good enough for me", the bird said, setting off from its perch. Quick like like a talon it shot down towards her breasts, the evil maiden shrieking as it dived into her cleavage. Between her wobbling breasts then the head of the black bird appeared, seemingly content in its position. "A bit tight, but it should do as a nest."  
  
"What do you think you are doing?!", the villainess shouted, shocked at her pet's behaviour. The bird looked up towards her face.  
  
"Making myself comfortable", it replied. "You got a problem with that?"  
  
"Of course I do!", she screamed, standing up from her throne.  
  
"Hey hey, watch your moves!", the bird yelled, going up and down inside her bosom. "I'm quite sensitive."  
  
"Oh yeah? Then how about THIS!?" Putting her hands back on her breasts the evil maiden pressed them together. The bird choked as it was squeezed between her mammaries, its eyes popping a little out of its head. The pressure caused a turmoil inside the villainess, but she kept pushing on her cheeky canary bird. Aware of its mistress' inner struggle it pulled its wings out of her cleavage. This already put her in quite a prickle, but it got even worse when the bird began to move them over her bosom. Her composure visibly wavered as the fine feathers brushed over her skin, while a goose-bump formed on her entire body. Nevertheless the villainess pressed stronger on her bosom, which in return led the bird to accelerate its wing movements.  
  
"Give it up!", it screamed with a hoarse voice. �You damage yourself more than me!"  
  
�Say that after I've pulled your bloody remnants out of my cleavage!" With all her might the vilainness squeezed her breasts together. The deformed piles of meat spilled up to her chin once more, burning with prickles. Being completely surrounded by breast flesh the bird was utterly immobilised, unable to do anything but helplessly waggle inside her bust. This aroused her even more, almost causing the young woman to faint from the increasing sensation. Her eyes rolled up, her breathing got harder, her whole body felt like it wasn't hers � she could already see the final destination rolling closer.  
  
Suddenly, she began to smile.   
  
From her smiling lips then a slight giggle emerged, slowly growing louder: The lustful sensation in her body had abruptly turned into harmless tickling. Her chuckle eventually burst out into massive laughter, and she let go of her breasts. Finally free the bird took in a deep breath, but stayed inside the cleavage. Laughing like a wild hyena its mistress then fell to the ground, holding her stomach. The little bird was shaken and jolted inside her cleavage, which only added to her tickle and laughter. The leather strap wind and tore on her jiggling breasts, its last holder almost ripping apart.    
  
After a while her laughter came to a halt. The evil maiden was panting in exhaustion, her breasts going up and down while their weight pressed on her torso. Lying on her back she looked up to the holes inside the roof, seeing the dark clouds in the sky.   
  
"So, shall we search for a way to break your curse?", the bird asked, still tucked between her breasts.  
  
Crossing her legs the villainess put her arms behind her head, still smiling. "Nah, I think I have a better idea."  
  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  
  
King Julian sat on his throne, bored like always. "I should start a war again soon", he decided. "There are rumors about imps terrorizing a country in the east. I could use this to justify a crusade and-"  
  
His thoughts were cut off when somebody knocked on the door.  
  
"I do not wish any interruptions!", the king shouted. Despite his declaration though the gates swung open, revealing a quite unusual visitor.  
  
"Well hello there, your majesty", the villainess smiled. One hand on her hip, the other one behind her back she walked over to his throne, making wide, slow steps. King Julian closely watched her coming nearer � needless to say where his attention was drawn to.  
  
"Wh-what do you want?", he asked, shifting around on his throne. His pupils went up and down as they followed the bounces of her breasts. "Are you an intruder?"  
  
An amused laugh sounded through the throne-room. "Yes, I am", the dark maiden replied, her smile as sweet as honey. "And to answer your question: I wanna take your crown."  
  
Shocked by those words the king pressed his back against the throne. "Guards!", he screamed, still focused on her barely covered bosom though.  
  
Nothing happened. "Oh, don't worry", she told him, climbing up the steps to his throne. "I've made sure none of your rude little guards is gonna bother us♥"  
  
"What did you do to them?", he shouted, his voice shaking both from the intensity of this situation.  
  
Standing directly before his throne the villainess looked down on King Julian, her smile devilishly cute. "The same thing I'm gonna do to you." She put her knee onto his lap, leaning closely against his body. "I'll grant you the most wonderful last five seconds of your life."   
  
The king didn't really listen to her words, completely distracted by the massive cleavage hanging into his face. Slowly then it disappeared from his sight, getting replaced by the villainess' unnaturally coloured, but still very pretty face. She moved her mouth towards the king's, their lips gradually getting closer to each other.  
  
As he closed his eyes in anticipation of a kiss, she pulled the frying pan out from her back and smacked it across his head.   
  
Unconscious the king sagged into his throne, a dumb expression on his face. "Or at least the most wonderful last five seconds outside of my jail", she chuckled, whirling her frying pan. Between her breasts then the little black bird appeared, holding a piece of paper and a small quill. Its movements lured a giggle out of the villainess.     
  
�That's four countries down", it declared, scratching a name from the list. "Only ninety-six to go!"  
  
Throwing the frying pan aside the evil maiden put her hands on her bosom. �See? I don't need hundreds of minions to conquer the world � I'm content with two."

This is a story I thought off a few months ago. Seeing how long it took me to write this it seems a bit short^^  
  
One point of the story was to improve my ability to describe BE when the expanded is wearing almost no clothes. Most of my expansions focus around the effects the growing breasts have on the clothes, so I thought it would be a little challenge to write a story with a practically nude main character. Didn't turn out quite as I hoped, but I guess that's nothing new to me by now.   
  
Also, I tend to give my characters no names lately. You think that's okay, or does it make the story too confusing?  
  
On a last note, this story had no real name until right before I uploaded it, so it turned out pretty random XD  
  
Enjoy ![:)](./I3reacl_files/smile.gif ":) (Smile)")

Excellent story! The few clothes to begin with was definitely a good idea, and my opinion on names v. no names is that it's working fine. If you have 10 characters, but each one is just 'the something" and "the other thing", that's fine, but if you need more than a few words to refer to each one, definitely add names.

I enjoyed. I enjoyed greatly. This story was very fun and sexy. I would like to see more about the Dark Maiden, but it does not seem like the type of story that needs a sequel. I love breast expansion fantasy stories; I need to write more myself.

Your descriptive parts are as great as always. It's actually very well made and quite humorous, especially the canary's remark on putting ads. Nice to see how she turned a curse to her advantage, she'll conquer those kingdoms in no time. I always wondered, what is the maximum size that you'd like to see a girl's breasts grow? Until they reach her knees or bigger?

I don't know. In a story, I am actually more interested in the process of expansion itself than the actual end-size. But I prefer if it doesn't get too ridiculously large: so much that it's just imaginable on a real woman would be enough for me. It's not a drama though if it goes a "little bit" over that ![;)](./I3reacl_files/wink.gif ";) (Wink)")

I see. So you only go as far as it's necessary for a story. That's cool.  
Yes, they are going to be a problem for her. Did she even think that there would be female rulers?

**The bird, epilogue**"Phew, I need a break."  
  
Tsunade, the fifth Hokage of the Hidden leave village, fell back into her chair. She had her eyes closed, not wanting to open them, as she knew all for her to see would be a desk loaded with unfinished paperwork.  
  
"Where's Shizune when I need her? I don't get anything done without her!" She tried to remember why she had send Shizune away with Sakura. It hit her: The reason she had send her away and why she was getting so few work done was because without Shizune, she made five times more breaks.  
  
Still, she didn't have much free time lately: She hadn't even come to read the recent newspapers, though this was probably](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/The-bird-epilogue-119825785) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**The bird, finale**"Ouch!" Sakura shrieked, making her breasts wobble at the sudden motion.  
  
"What's wrong?" Shizune asked.  
  
The pink-haired girl stroke her cheeks. "A bee stung into my butt." The older medic smiled.  
  
"Well, I guess we need be more careful now as we have more 'area' to protect." Sakura sighed, Hinata blushed.   
"Anyway," she continued in a more serious voice "I think you know why I brought you here." The "here" she mentioned was a dead end a bit off the main road, a place surrounded by walls without windows. Only a tree without leaves and a group of ravens sitting on it's branches were watching them: Sakura stroking her butt, Hinata in her blue](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/The-bird-finale-118791459)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**The bird, part 7**Even after Sakura had convinced Hinata, the photograph still had to wait a while before they got out of the changing room: As Hinata's top didn't really support her very much, she was taking every step as slowly as possible, always stopping for a few seconds when something jiggled on her body. Sakura meanwhile made her breasts jiggle and bounce a lot as she was hopping impatiently up and down while spurting her friend. Eventually, she grabbed Hinata's arm and drew her out to the shooting room, under heavy bouncing of both their chests and heavy blushes only from Hinata.  
  
Unlike the residents, the photograph they had hired seemed to be used to](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/The-bird-part-7-116219907)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**The bird, part 6**Laying on her bosom, Shizune thought she could be happier.  
  
She opened her mouth as three man each placed grapes on her tounge. They weren't her servants, actually, they were just some people who randomly walked by the window, saw her eating grapes, and spontanously offered their "help" - of course only to get a good look on her. Closing her mouth, she started to chew the fruits, slowly, while her feeders closely took a look into her "depths".  
  
'Am I allergic to silk?' she wondered as her left breast started to itch. The residents had given her this expansive bedding alongside the house, and lots of exotic articles like jade elephants, bamboo](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/The-bird-part-6-115176096)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**The bird, part 5**The shy girl blushed, nodding slightly. "Y-Yeah" she stuttered, "I d-didn't do it on purpose, I was j-just..."  
  
"Explain it later!" Shizune interrupted, feeling her grip was starting to fade, "Help me back in first! Go into my room and pull me inside!"  
  
 Now Hinata's cheeks got even more red. "B-But I'm just barely dressed. If someone sees me... also, I'm afraid my clothes will be destroyed if I move... C-can't you just let yourself fall? Y-You're a high level ninja..."  
  
Shizune looked at her body. "I don't think I can make a summersault in mid-air like this." Suddenly, her hands lost grip for a moment and her upper-body sank down some inches](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/The-bird-part-5-114016664)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**The bird, part 4**Looking at herself in the mirror, the black-haired woman thought: 'I could really use some more curves.'  
  
Shizune sighed wandering up and down the room she and Sakura shared. Lady Tsundade had told her to observate Sakura's chakra training, but instead, she was sitting around in her room, feeling depressed about still being single.  
  
'If we just would have travelled through the forest instead of taking the road.' she thought, 'Then we wouldn't have met this damn photo model with her stupid boyfriend, and I could now happily watch Sakura's progress.' She looked again in the mirror, touching her hips. Why was Lady Tsunades body so much more deve](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/The-bird-part-4-113798200)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**The bird, intermezzo**From the sky, the people of the little town at the edge of the fire country looked like ants - irony, since birds in the sky also looked much smaller from down there. Therefore, a little blue bird flying high above the ground was almost not visible. However, hidden in the forest, a man in a black and red robe with a strange sunhat looked right up to such a bird. He didn't say or do anything, but it seemed as if he was calling it just by his look: The bird flew deeper and deeper, broke through the leaves of the trees and landed on the man's hand. Still silent, the two just looked at each other.  
  
Suddenly, the silence was broken by the yawn of](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/The-bird-intermezzo-113112256) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**The bird, part 3**The main street of the little town was quite dead, as most inhabitants were at lunch right now, and the tourism season was over as well. Only a black cat walked on the dusty road, looking for some food, but there was no mouse or anything else for her to hunt. She only saw a blue bird in the sky as she passed by a tavern, but it was far too high for her to reach it.  
  
Near the end of the town, her noise was attracted by the delicious smell of fish. She sniffed a bit, identifying a bunch of garbage cans as source of it. She quickly stepped towards them, starting to scratch them in hope she could throw it over and...

**The bird, part 2**A pair of white eyes moved around, stopping everytime they were pointed at one of the exotic objects on the wall: strange coloured masks, katanas in fashionable hilts, pictures of surreal landscapes, kimonos whick looked like they were from another world. Listening to her father who talked to the woman at the reception, the girl wondered where all this curiosities might come from. Suddenly, her thougts were interrupted by a harsh, loud voice.  
  
"Hinata!" her father yelled, then continued in a more quite (but still harsh) tone: "I finished signing up. I and Hinabi will go to our room. You will meanwhile start your chakra focusation traning in t](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/The-bird-part-2-111893533)

**Lust** The most saddening feeling in the world is the feeling of being in love with someone who doesn't know you exist. Holly has found herself in this position.  
  
 Everyday at school, she sees the most gorgeous boy she has ever known. Michael Werden. The boy is charming, built, and oh-so dashing. Almost every period, Holly swoons as he walks past her locker.  
  
 Holly is a beautiful girl. She wears the cutest outfits, has the most gorgeous shade of brown hair, and her eyes are a vivid green. Her face has no imperfections, with soft and luscious skin.

**Expanding Lingerie**Josie was about to start college and wanted some new clothes and underwear before she started her new life.  
She went to the mall and checked out the department store. Finding clothes for Josie was always easy because of her thin build. She had cute 32b cups breast, and 34" waist. The blonde picked up a few clothes, then got a cute red bra and panties she liked and went into the dressing room.  
As Josie took off her clothes and tried the lingerie, she liked the feel and look the red bra and panties gave her in the mirror, but she noticed some itching on her boobs and ass shortly after putting on the underwear. She then tried on some jeans, bu](http://citizenbjm.deviantart.com/art/Expanding-Lingerie-306081634)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Reverse Breast Reduction**Tiffany was tired of her large E cup breast. She hated the rude comments from men every time she walked down the street, and she couldn't do basic everyday things like tie her shoes, jog, and driving was tough. Her breast grew extremely fast during high school and didn't stop until shortly after starting college.   
Tiffany wanted a reduction, but feared scarring from surgery. So she saw a doctor who promised he could shrink the size of her breast by having the fat and tissue sucked out. After some checking Tiffany arranged for an appointment. When she got to the office, the doctor had her undress and he placed two large dome like bowls over e](http://citizenbjm.deviantart.com/art/Reverse-Breast-Reduction-306086690)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)

By spring, Lettie's folks were talking about getting her back into the public schools for the fall term. She'd kept up well enough she could probably advance with her class, although she'd have to test in. And she'd gained enough control of her size-changing powers that her clothing now changed with her, although the shifts weren't perfect.

Though, what Devon had kept noticing, was that� he was enjoying it a lot. It just made him think of when he was younger, people picked on him because he loved taking photos. Laughed at him because he was scrawny and too thin, because he was a failure, but not anymore!

She saw a hotdog man with his cart pushing pass in the spot she wanted. Natasha laid her towel down and kneeled on her knees and started to pour some oil she brought with her in her hands.

Rows of buildings passed by as she happily made her way through the shops.  
  
 People smiled and waved at her as she walked by. Staci wouldn't consider herself popular, but she certainly was friendly to everyone who met her. She was that happy-go-lucky type who just wished to get along with everyone.

 Robert couldn�t believe his eyes as he stared at the giant mounds his girlfriend presented to him. �Wow�, was all he brought as he gazed at their firm curves, dropping his jaw at their unholy size. �I haven�t ever seen something so� *huge* before.�   
  
Rebecca felt slightly embarrassed by her boyfriend�s praise, especially when he reached out and touched them. �So... you like them?�, she asked sheepishly.  
  
Slowly Robert stroked them, feeling their enormousness with his own hands. �Like them? I LOVE them!�, he replied, grinning from ear to ear. In the gentlest manner he ran the tips of his fingers over the curvaceous slopes, following their roundings. �Unbelievable�, he murmured, put in awe by the stoutness of his girlfriend�s melons. �How did you get them so firm? And so big?�  
  
Touching and complementing her two fruits Rebecca blushed. �I massage them every day�, she replied. �I know most people say this is just hijinks, but I�d say the results�� She slightly stroke over their lush curves. ��tell a different story.�  
  
Intensely Robert inspected every inch of them with his hands and eyes. �So huge�, he murmured, his mind still unable to comprehend the sheer size of her orbs. With a smile he looked up into her eyes. �Wow, Becky!�, he said. �You�ll definitely win this year�s water melon competition with these!�  
  
Grinning Rebecca put one hand on her back while rubbing through her short carrot-orange hair with the other one. �Thanks Robbie!�, she said. Kneeling down she patted her two water melons, each as round and large as a beach ball. �It really took me some effort to get them like this, so it�d be great if it paid off!�  
  
Robert nodded. �All right, I�ve gotta go now�, he said, standing up from the ground. �Bye, Becky!�, he said, waving as he walked towards the fence gate of her garden.  
  
Rebecca also straightened up again and waved back at him. �See you later Robbie!�, she chirped. Once he was gone she looked up at the sky. The sun burned down on her and her garden, heating up air and ground. �Phew, I�m thirsty!�, she said, fanning some air to her face. She turned her back to her big melons. Through the dirt path that led through her garden she marched to the back door of her house, past all her other plants: Trees with ripe plums, apples and grapefruits, as well as cantaloupes and pumpkins growing on the ground.   
  
Unknown to her a small object was approaching from the sky. The light it emitted steadily became brighter as it fell towards earth, burning bright red. Upon closer look one would have seen it was a tiny meteor from space. It was far away from its home, a planet cultivated by a highly intelligent species that however eventually had fallen to its own arrogance and vanity as a cosmetic product had caused all the women to grow so gigantic busts the planet had collapsed under their weight. The meteor was a fragment of that planet � and it still carried a large dose of said substance on its surface. In a high speed it fell downwards, dispersing on the way, but coming steadily closer towards Rebecca.   
  
A hundred meters before it reached her however it was hit by a secret military mini-missile and shattered into a billion pieces too tiny to cause any effects on anybody.   
  
At the same time, on the house on the opposite side of the street a man was lying on the roof, a rifle in his hand. Looking through the scope he aimed at his ex that coincidentally walked past the garden fence of Rebecca�s home. She had left him because of his fetish for extremely large breasts. �Payback time�, he murmured, slowly pulling the trigger of the gun loaded with a projectile containing a breast-expanding serum. Just as he shot however the wind blew dust into his eye, blinding him. Therefore he accidentally fired in Rebecca�s direction, the young woman still walking obliviously towards her back door as the bullet approached her at high-speed.   
  
But before it could hit her she stumbled over a root and fell on her face.   
  
The arrow hit her door instead and was redirected towards her neighbor who was also working in her own garden, but due to a genetic disorder was immune to the serum. While the projectile hit her neighbor with no effect Rebecca fell to the ground, towards something that would make her breasts grow if she landed on it.   
  
But she crashed next to it into the dirt.   
  
�Ouch�, she murmured, slowly standing up from the ground. Once she was back on her feet she brushed the dirt off her clothes, a simple pair of jeans and a cropped purple T-shirt without shoulder parts. While stepping up the small stairs to her back door she put her hand into her pocket, taking her keys out. She put her house key in the lock and turned it around. The door opened with a welcoming �click�, Rebecca pushing it open and entering her kitchen while still holding her key. Pulling it out of the lock she stored it back in the pocket of her jeans while closing the door behind her with her foot. Inside her small kitchen she immediately walked over to her refrigerator and opened it. �Where�s the orange juice?�, she murmured. After a while of scramming through the shelves filled with self-grown vegetables and fruits she found her self-made orange juice in the back of her freezer, stored in a plastic bottle. �There you are!�, she declared, smiling as she pulled it carefully out between all the other food. Closing the door with a kick of her hip she held the bottle in front of her, softly turning the top around.  
  
As it was open Rebecca jumped when loud pop music began to play from its inside. Dropping the juice she stumbled backwards until she bumped against her kitchen table. �What the hell?!�, she screamed. As the catchy melody boomed into her ears the young woman was feeling a strange effect the music had on her body. A weak, but noticeable tingle emerged in her chest, engulfing the flat board that held her petite breasts. Slowly the tiny mounds with barely noticeable curves were starting to move forward. �What the hell?�, she screamed again, staring at her burgeoning bosom. As the intro of the song went on she felt the little swells of flesh pressing against the material of her top, slowly vaulting out from her body while spreading over the upper half of her torso. Lying plain on her chest the purple fabric steadily bulged out in two little bumps, the roundings of her bust becoming bit by bit more noticeable. �WHAT THE HELL?!? This makes no sense whatsoever!�, she shouted, both furious and nervous. Each breast steadily reached forward, away from her body, while the amount of flesh rising from her chest increased in a gradually greater circular area. As the surface beneath her shirt arched the fabric began to throw slight wrinkles around them. These little folds bit by bit were pushed to the periphery of her curves as the fronts of her protruding assets were shaping into round domes, evening the fabric over them. While her breasts surged out from her body, swelling like fresh bee stings the music from the spilled bottle of juice went from the intro to the first singing part:  
  
*�We�re no strangers to lo-ove, you know the rules and � so do I!�* Irritated Rebecca raised her glance from the little plums under her shirt towards the bottle on the floor. The juice had flown mainly out of it, some drops dripping from the opening into the orange puddle around it. While she looked at the bottle that magically emitted music from its inside her breasts continued to flow out, gaining gradually more striking roundings. Wrapping the fabric of her shirt around them one could see the tiny bulges steadily jutting forward and splaying over her chest, cambering towards the sides of her body as well as towards each other. As they swelled bit by bit bigger the fabric began not only to rise around them but also in the space between her mounds, getting stretched like a laundry line that was slowly strained over them. The further her bust stuck from her body the more the fabric was lifted up, the sink it formed in the middle of her chest gradually evening as her curves grew into the free space. On their sides one could see the roundness of her assets slowly becoming apparent as their basements arched outwards. Steadily her bumps of flesh formed little domes, getting rounder with each millimeter they were standing out from her body. Just like the sides the top and bottom slopes of her bosom were also billowing towards a globular shape as they bend outwards, forcing their flaring form on the fabric around them. Getting pulled over them her shirt covered the curves of her bust slightly, but the tighter it was stretched over her them the clearer they were pronounced by the fabric. At the same time the inner halves of her mounds became hard to see as the fabric between them made her bosom look like one individual bump the closer her breasts were approaching each other, only a small gap separating them. Having grown to fistfuls of flesh they slowly transcended into real spheres, vaulting so far their widest parts began to lap over their basement.   
  
*�A full commitment's what I'm thinking o-of, you wouldn't get this from any other guy�*- as the music continued to play her breasts ballooned into steadily bigger dimensions. Still spreading out over her chest they were evenly expanding on all ends, becoming more globular by the second. Slowly the rim of her shirt began to move downwards, her top being bit by bit wrapped around her bust. Hanging a bit below her neck it wandered towards the top of her bosom, which in return gradually ascended towards the end of the fabric. While her shirt glided lower its hem was at the same time was starting to rise � it wasn�t visible yet, but Rebecca could feel it rubbing very gentle over her ribcage. Already uncovering her belly the young woman decided not to wait until her outfit got even more revealing. �I�ll end this nonsense!�, she declared. Her feet stomped heavily on the tiles of the kitchen floor as she walked towards the bottle. Her steps caused little sways in her swelling sweater meat, just small vibrations that shook the flesh of her bust and made it wobble a little up and down. As she marched to the source of her discomfort the fabric was almost completely pulled straight between her breasts, only a slight sink indicating her bosom was made up of two mounds. Forming a unitary bump her bosom surged out proudly from her body, stretching her shirt as it billowed to all sides and gradually covered its surrounding under its vaulting curves. Filling out the entire free space in her top her breasts bumped softly against each other. The more they grew and their roundings blew up the tighter the squeeze between her assets became, their curves steadily flattening under the pressure they forced on each other.  
   
*�I - just wanna tell you how I�m feeling - gotta make you understa-and!�* As they were around the size of apples Rebecca reached the music bottle. She lowered her glance to look down on it. The sight of her bust standing out from her startled her for a moment, seeing her formerly flat board was flat no more. For a moment, as she watched her rack swelling larger the thought crossed her mind to let the music play, to go with the situation, to accept this exceptional gift of nature and use this opportunity to turn into a curvaceous and sexy beast any man would drool at sight, a true monstrosity of a womanly figure with breasts the size of bean bag chairs or beyond. The thought however only lasted a second before she began to act like a real person with self-respect and dignity again and not a construction for a fetish story.   
  
Raising her foot she stomped on the bottle, squashing it beneath her sandal. Most of the leftover juice was squirted out, spraying over the floor. As it was deformed the music abruptly stopped, just before it hit the chorus. The moment the melody ended the tingle in her chest was beginning to subside. Looking down on her breasts Rebecca saw that they reached out from her body steadily slower, the speed of their expansion decreasing with every second. Just before the top of her shirt reached her chest it stopped gliding downwards as no more fabric was wrapped around her bust. For split seconds though a small cleavage appeared as her bosom rocked forth and back with Rebecca�s heavy breaths, the fabric stretching every time she inhaled and relaxing whenever she breathed out again. The amount of her breasts uncovered extended a bit for a few seconds as she took in a deep breath, before the fabric rose back over her chest once she let out the air in a long sigh. �Whatever this was, I�m glad it�s over�, she said to herself, smiling slightly. She shook her head as the melody from the song still echoed through her mind, causing her charms to softly swing to the sides. �Gotta get this song out of my head�, she murmured, hitting on her ear as she walked towards her kitchen counter. With a quick twist she turned on her old-fashioned radio from the seventies.  
  
*�Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down, never gonna turn around and desert you!�* Rebecca shrieked, jumping back in surprise and making her grapefruit-sized breasts bounce a bit. Just as she turned it on the same song began to play from the radio, from the exact spot where it had left off. *�Never gonna make you cry, never gonnay sa-ay goodbye-ye, never gonna tell a lie and hurt you!�* The instant the lyrics and melody flowed into her ears the tingle returned to her bosom. Picking right up where it ended her flesh burgeoned and ballooned again, stretching her purple shirt around it while spreading through the air. �OH COME ON!�, Rebecca screeched. The rim of her top permanently slid down the slopes of her bust, uncovering a small black gap in the middle as well a little portion of skin. The lower the neck of her shirt glided the more it bent from an even line to a slight U-form, extending her cleavage bit by bit. Front, bottom, top and sides, at every end her breasts were gradually charging into new territory, swelling into steadily larger grapefruits. As panic arose in the young woman she immediately threw her arms over her ancient radio, hastily fumbling around the button to change the channel. On every single one however the same song was playing, as if all of them had decided to simultaneously broadcast it. �W-what the hell?�, Rebecca screamed once more, trying to shut off her radio. It didn�t react though, not even when she plugged out the energy, but just continued to play. �WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON TODAY?!�, she shouted, dragging on her short red mane in despair. �Music plays from a bottle of orange juice, the radio is hexed � have I been cursed or something?!�  
  
*�We've known each other � for so lo-ong, your heart's been aching but - you're too shy to say it!�* Rebecca slammed her fist on the radio, the impact causing her bust to wobble slightly and shake her little flesh for a few seconds. �Oh shut up!�, she yelled into the speaker. Pulling her shirt around them her breasts were billowing larger, reaching out to all sides as well as towards their inner curves. In the nimble cleavage one could see her orbs hugging each other steadily tighter, the contact becoming bit by bit more forceful as they fought for space under the purple fabric. The more her shirt was stretched the clearer their curves were visible, the swelling slopes of her globes arching the material around them. Slowly each end of her bosom was getting strikingly round, giving her small spheres a slightly firm shape as they stood proudly from her body. While ever more fabric sunk into the gap between her bust and her body it was strained smoothly over them, accenting the even surface of her breasts. At the same time wrinkles were throwing around the sides where they flared out from her body, vaulting the more her bosom charged forth and dragged her top along. While it was jutting out further and further the rim of her shirt was pulled down the curves of her rack. As her bow-formed neckline had extended to roughly two centimeters in length her cleavage expanded at a more subtle rate, friction and pressure making it go down more slowly over the top of her meat buns. Therefore the hem of her top steadily picked up its pace at wandering up her body, rising towards the bottom of her chest. As it slid up her ribcage it began to bend in the middle like her neckline while being lifted up slightly at the center the closer it got to the underside of her breasts.  
  
*�Inside we both know what's been � going on, we know the game and we're gonna pla-ay it!�* Slight droplets of sweat formed on Rebecca�s forehead as she watched her mammaries expanding to the diameter of CDs, being as large as small cantaloupes. The fruits hanging from her chest continued to grow riper, becoming �juicier� by the second. On the sides their wide flanks started to lap over her body while on the opposite ends they were squeezing ever tighter against each other, forcing the centers of her bosom to shift a little aside as they spread out in her cramped shirt. The fronts of her breasts gradually protruded away from her, standing around ten centimeters or four to five inches out from her body. Their tops and bottoms covered steadily more of her body above and below her bust, the bulging curvature bending at the same rate into each direction. The firm appeal of her spheres grew more striking the bustier Rebecca became, the once plain girl having already turned into a rather buxom vixen. With mixed feelings � in the meaning of she was partly panicked and partly angry � she watched herself gaining a top-heavier frame by the second, transcending from naturally big into scales one wouldn�t meet so easily on the streets. The sides of her orbs started to gently stroke her arms, the width of her bust getting slowly closer to the breadth across her shoulders. Nervously Rebecca pulled her arms a little back, stretching the conjunction between her shoulder-less sleeves and the main part of her shirt. The fabric was tightened even more over her bosom, making it slightly transparent at the area of the most pressure while accenting the slight sink between her breasts. As the creaking of the stitches considerably increased she quickly moved her shoulders forth again, easing the pressure from her shirt and allowing the flanks of her bust to softly vault against her arms. With a gulp she saw her small cantaloupes had swollen to a pair of very ripe and firm fruits, standing proud and round on her chest.   
  
*�A-and if you ask me how I'm fee-eeling, don't tell me you're too - blind to see!�* Ever more fabric was lifted below her bust, distancing further from her body the closer the hem of her shirt got to her bosom. While the bottom rim of her top was getting bend upwards faster and faster the neck on the other end had almost stopped growing deeper, resting at an inch full of cleavage. The slight curve her neck threw over her breasts revealed a bowl-shape excerpt on them, reaching from the fine black line in the middle to the roundings below her shoulders. Her display on skin vanished however as her globes ascended towards her neck, her cleavage blocked by the rising slopes of her bust. Similarly their flanks were bit by bit lapping over her arms, her bosom being almost as wide from one end to the other as a normal-sized laptop while reaching as much out as one was long. Being pulled steadily deeper into the sink between her mounds the rate at which the fabric stretched around her assets was starting to slow down. The little part of her bosom looking out over the neck of her shirt was swelling slightly faster than the flesh confined inside it, leading her cleavage to slowly deepen again.   
  
As Rebecca�s sight to the ground was almost completely blocked by the bump of her chest, being unable to see anything of her body but her bust she finally decided to act: With both hands she grabbed the unplugged and shut-down radio that still played music, her arms slightly squeezing against the sides of her bust as she wrapped her arms around the old machine. A loud creak filled the kitchen as Rebecca raised it above her head, automatically sticking her bosom out from her body and making it press harder against her top. With all her strength she tossed her beloved radio against the wall, causing a heavy hop in her hooters as she leaned her whole body forward.  
  
The old radio crushed against the wall, breaking into several pieces. *Never gonna give � gonna give � give � giiiiiive�* The sound from the speakers died off as they fell to the ground, alongside the rest of her radio. Her gaze on the scrambled pieces of metal that crashed on the tiles Rebecca panted heavily, causing her bust to go in and out from her body. Aside from this though there was no movement in her large lumps of flesh anymore, her breasts resting peacefully inside her top. It groaned at every of her breathes, but not hearing it stretch continuously around her bosom was already music in the redhead�s ears. Slowly her breath calmed down, while she straightened her body.  A slight blush formed on her face as she looked down on her breasts, seeing their wide and buoyant slopes snuggly hugging her fabric. Sometimes it seemed like the stitches could burst off any second, Rebecca breathing very carefully not to burst it apart. A bit hesitantly she put her hands on their sides. The bottom of her palms rested on the left and right periphery of her bust while the tips of her fingers just barely reached to the center of each breast, both being as large as her head. Feeling the strained purple fabric Rebecca unbelievingly widened her eyes, not able to compute what had just happened � except that she had turned from a slender and attractive young woman into a blown-up bimbo with a way too exaggerated martini-glass figure. �At least it�s finally over�, she whispered to herself, though she didn�t sigh in relief in fear of shredding her top.  
  
Suddenly the fourth wall of her kitchen (they were numbered for no apparent reason) broke apart. Through the hole in the wall Rick Astley from the eighties entered her house, dancing and singing to a melody that seemed to come from everywhere. *�Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down, never gonna turn around and desert you! Never gonna make you cry, never gonna sa-ay goodbye, never gonna tell a lie and desert you!�*  
  
Her hands still on her bust Rebecca blinked several times as she saw the man from the past standing in a hole in her kitchen, her eyes wide open, her heart beating fast in shock. �Oh, whatever�, she suddenly moaned, her head dropping back while she let her arms hang from her body. Giving up she just let the live-performance flow from her ears into her breasts, making them swell beyond the size of her head and get bigger than her buttocks. As Rick Astley continued to repeat the catchy chorus over and over her melons became bigger and bigger, the former cantaloupes transcending into steadily larger sorts of water melons. The more flesh was gathered inside her top the further it rose up, hanging just a centimeter below her bust over her body. Under her top a hint of her bosom�s bottoms already lolled out, the deepest points of her breasts unveiled as the fabric smoothly glided over their ascents. After hovering a few millimeters above them for a moment the hem of her shirt gently landed on her skin. The moment it touched Rebecca the material already pressed tightly against her curves, being stretched over the sink between her breasts like the rest of the fabric lying on the front of her bosom. Due to the pressure the hem had deformed into a slight U-shape like the neck of her shirt, only turned upside down. Lying around a quarter above the bottom of her bust one could see under the line of the purple fabric her breasts were tightly squeezing against each other in a rich under-cleavage, the entire lower halves of her spheres being free from cover. The depth � or rather �height� � of her bottom d�collet� extended as her rack surged forward and wrapped her shirt more and more towards the equator of her bosom, steadily stripping out of her shirt as her feminine roundings arched towards the end of her ribcage and the top of her belly.   
  
While their undersides reached gradually deeper the expansion of her mammaries slowed down on the sides, the cambering of her curves being hindered by the ever tighter fabric. The rich purple hue of the shirt turned into a lavender tone the tighter it was pulled, the stitching starting to get visible on the wide flanks of her bust. At the same time the fabric that slightly fell into the gap between her breasts began to throw wrinkles near the middle of her chest while also becoming paler by the second. Three waves of cotton were puffing up in the middle of her bosom, becoming larger the tighter it was stretched. Simultaneously a sound between hissing and creaking was filling the room, at first overplayed by the loud music from Rick Astley, but slowly the noise ascended above the song. A loud �rip� filled out the room as two tears formed between the folds, eradicating the wrinkles in the process. The holes were eye-shaped and roughly as large as three of her fingers together, displaying a slight amount of cleavage as well as some of her breasts� inner curves. On the sides her bosom slightly splayed outwards due to the release in pressure, gaining a bit more room. The little �explosion� caused tiny wobbles and ripples to go through her flesh, shaking her assets a little and making them sway like pudding. As she had already given up Rebecca didn�t gasp or screech as her top started to give in, but only sighed while she waited for her jiggling udders to calm down. As their mini-bounces subsided their growth became more apparent again, her mounds still visibly swelling under the influence of Rick Astley�s magic music. Growing larger than volleyballs they were getting bit by bit closer to the lush pumpkins in her garden, and were even approaching the whole pride of the hobby gardener, her giant hopefully soon-to-be-priced water melons.  
  
Ever further the swells of her flesh spread out into every direction, reaching higher as well as lower and wider. Soon the sides of her bosom were getting cramped again as they reached beyond her hanging arms, becoming as wide as her shoulders � if the round surface of their curves wasn�t slowly getting flattened by the fabric constricting them they would have probably jut out beyond them by an inch. On the bottom meanwhile the flesh of her spheres was reaching a bit more to the sides, being free from her shirt. As the hem glided up her bust it continued to bend, forming a soft half-circle. Her under cleavage swiftly extended until it reached the bottom third of her bosom, leaving a vast amount of bulging flesh and skin to stare at. The pressure then caused the hem to rise up at a slower rate, the speed at which it wandered over the slopes of her breasts decreasing exponentially until it almost stayed at its position. In return the neckline of her top began to glide down faster again, the protruding front of her rack pulling ever more fabric around its billowing roundings. While her �upper� cleavage deepened, bit by bit moving towards the highest ascent of her bust beyond which it could have been seen from the front again her orbs tried to squeeze with steadily more force through the openings of her top, lapping both over the hem and neck of her shirt. The tops of her assets had grown above her shoulders in height and were half on the way to her chin, though it was unlikely they would directly touch it as the peaks of her mammaries gradually moved away from each other, drifting apart as the walls of her cleavage pressed her breasts aside. As their inner flanks flared wider the pressure in her cleavage caused each curve to rub steadily stronger over its opposing counterpart, causing a slight frictional heat to build up between her mounds.  
  
Surpassing the smaller sorts of water melons her breasts had transcended to the size of standard Halloween pumpkins, with the only flaw in the comparison being their form: Instead of slightly oval the stacks of meat in her top were still perfectly round and spherical, bending equally into every direction � or at least tried to, but the prison of her top proved to become more damaging to their shape by the second. Hindered at the front and sides ever more flesh had to spill out through the rips, the hem and the neck of her top, especially the last gliding ever swifter up the bulging steeps of her bust. The two tears over the middle of her chest were gradually growing as the fabric was stretched tighter and tighter around her bosom, remaining their proportions in relation to the intact parts of her shirt. Above the higher rip a wave began to form again, slowly expanding until the strain it forced on the fabric caused a third hole to appear, just as large as the others. Again her breasts wobbled, but slighter than last time as the release in pressure was only diminutive, their flanks barely spreading out to the sides. Another ripple suddenly went through her bust as a fourth tear formed above the freshly formed, quickly followed by two more. The shaking of her assets tore on the consistence of the cotton, making the tears extend by a considerable amount. As long as her forearms the rifts near the center of her breasts were close to reveal something that should stay private, though Rebecca honestly didn�t care at that point very much if she kept her intimacy or not. With six rips on the front of her shirt, the deepest being just a bit above the hem while the highest was near the top of her bosom her jugs had a bit more room to spread out, their flesh jiggling up and down as well as left and right in centimeter jumps. They still remained cramped through, their bottoms squeezing more and more out as they vaulted towards her belly button.    
  
The largest pumpkins in her garden soon were no match for her sweater puppies anymore. As the bottom of her sight was steadily invaded by the top of her bosom she could see the fabric retreating over its slopes until her cleavage reached over them. Her neckline rested for a split second on the highest part of her rack before it started to glide towards the front of her bust and out of her vision. While her cleavage slowly rolled down her hills another tear formed just a little bit beneath it, in the same form and size as the others. Seven rips with roughly the same distance to each other were torn into the front of her top, looking like they were part of its design. In each eye-shaped tear one could take a tiny peek at her cleavage and a not-so-tiny peek at the skin around her breast gap, showing how her round curves squeezed together. The distance between the individual tears diminished as the neck of her top slid deeper, bending over her bust. As it hung just as low as the hem was hanging high, the display on both ends being roundabout equal it dropped its speed, wandering slower towards the center of her bosom. Above and below her breasts lapped over the fabric as wide domes of flesh, their �roofs� arching in the same pace up- respectively downwards while hugging each other closer and tighter. As both the neck and hem were crooked, lying deeper/higher at the cleavage as on the flanks a little more fabric had been pulled to the wide sides of her globes. However they were not quite as round as they could be, her top still pressing on them.   
  
Suddenly the fabric was enhanced by a tiny alien race that was flying in UFOs around Rebecca so it would stretch better around her bosom, because round boobs are way sexier than cramped boobs. The boost in flexibility let her orbs take on their truly round form on all sides, her shirt resting smoothly, but not too tightly over their curves.  
  
As her breasts were on height with her mouth and bellybutton while being each as wide as her entire bum Britney lowered her glance towards them. Though she couldn�t see their fronts beyond their wide tops she guessed they were jutting out as much from her as the melons she had shown Robert earlier were large. A quick look over the horizon of her chest and she saw Rick Astley was still dancing in the hole in her wall, just about to repeat the chorus once more. She dropped her head back into her neck, sighing soundly over the music. �Oh well, at least I will definitely win the prize with *these* melons�, she mumbled to herself.   
  
And then her boobs outgrew the universe.

A satire on society that questions the Western beauty ideal and combines elements from a parody with the symbolism of classic literature - that is a good description of what this story isn�t. Happy 1st April!

I have a fairly solid vocabulary, it's not normally expanded by reading expansion writing. It was a nice surprise to be educated by this story as well, and I respect the skill it takes to use words like that properly, as an author.

Oh, I see. Well I'm not really sure if "camber" can actually be used to describe growing breasts. An online dictionary just says it's a synonym for "vault" or "bulge", so I'm using it sometimes for more diversity in my stories. But thank you ![:)](./I3reacl_files/smile.gif ":) (Smile)")

Hm... is there a point to spellchecking an April Fool's joke, I wonder?  
  
  
***Tress** with ripe plums*  
  
Trees  
  
 *before she began to act like real person with self-respect and dignity again*  
  
There should be an "a" before "real".  
  
*d�collet� extended as her rack surged forward*  
  
There's two spaces between as and her.  
  
  
  
Dang, though. Unless I'm misunderstanding, she must have a huge butt, based on a sentence shortly after Astley shows up.

Isn't a butt cheek roughly as big as a head? From the proportions I mean, the length and width, not the exact form. At least mine are... does this mean I have a large butt? or a small head? ![:O](./I3reacl_files/eek.gif ":O (Eek)")

Problem is one can't really stare at his own butt... Now that I think about it though women have slightly larger butts than men, so her butt would actually be rather small.

Since this is April Fool's Day, I almost would have preferred if the story contained no expansion at all, just a long series of near-misses. Kinda like the first half was, until the song started...

Well, I'm a BE story writer. Writing a complete almost-BE story might be a bit too much of a tease^^

Fuck you april 1st. All of this, because we used to celebrate new years on the wrong day? I think I'll have to pull the ultimate april fools joke one year, by making everyone think it's april second and not first.

**i had an out-of-body experience.**I had an out-of-body experience at the age of thirty-one.  
  
Every year between the ages of ten and eighteen, I sent a letter to NASA.  I told them a little bit about myself, the same general description year after year, and always insisted that despite my medical condition, I would one day love to sail through the stars.  My dream was to be out there in the universal abyss, exploring every unknown corner until we knew all that we could.  
  
Art would taunt, �Sick kids don�t go to space� before Mom slapped the back of his shoulder with a spatula.  
  
NASA was as nice as they could be, but the bottom line was that we all knew I could](http://laura-lie.deviantart.com/art/i-had-an-out-of-body-experience-389277978)[![](./I3reacl_files/dragoeniex.jpg)
**One Sip**Since that night, I have believed in love at first song.  
  
You sang.  
  
Darling, you stirred your voice into the coffeehouse scents;  
It carried notes of inspiration and the flavor of your soul.  
  
You smiled.  
  
Your words trickled down my throat, and I savored their warmth.   
There was no bitterness, no dregs- just your heart poured out.  
  
You stood.  
  
I abandoned my cup to follow, �hello� scalding my tongue.](http://dragoeniex.deviantart.com/art/One-Sip-392857616)[![](./I3reacl_files/april_8th_by_ilman_lintu-d60wvam.jpg)](http://ilman-lintu.deviantart.com/art/April-8th-364330606 "April 8th by *Ilman-Lintu, Apr 8, 2013 in Photography > Abstract & Surreal > Surreal")[![](./I3reacl_files/soulmates_by_srdce-d6gm7ro.jpg)](http://srdce.deviantart.com/art/Soulmates-390707412 "Soulmates by ~Srdce, Aug 4, 2013 in Traditional Art > Paintings > Other")[![](./I3reacl_files/HC032_by_Shroom_Stock.jpg)](http://shroom-stock.deviantart.com/art/HC032-150914205 "HC032 by ~Shroom-Stock, Jan 18, 2010 in Resources & Stock Images > Stock Images > Model > Female > Full Body")[![](./I3reacl_files/tournoi_des_as_2_by_13_septembre-d5yrmt9.jpg)](http://13-septembre.deviantart.com/art/tournoi-des-As-2-360727101 "tournoi des As 2 by ~13-septembre, Mar 21, 2013 in Photography > Photojournalism > Sports")[![](./I3reacl_files/5b70e9ef2fed848f15468b61d6ef964e-d6jjbsl.jpg)](http://trichardsen.deviantart.com/art/Heavenly-395611509 "Heavenly by *Trichardsen, Aug 24, 2013 in Photography > Animals, Plants & Nature > Weather and Sky")[![](./I3reacl_files/final_fantasy_type_0_class_zero_opening_by_dan_gyokuei-d6jxf9p.jpg)](http://dan-gyokuei.deviantart.com/art/Final-Fantasy-Type-0-Class-Zero-Opening-396269197 "Final Fantasy Type_0_Class Zero_Opening by ~Dan-Gyokuei, Aug 27, 2013 in Photography > People & Portraits > Cosplay")

The absolute number
one cause of
rejection of DD
suggestions for most
Artisan Craft CVs is
poor photography.
There is nothing
worse than seeing an
otherwise brilliant
piece ruined by a
dodgy photo. But
even beyond DD
acceptance, if you

Her gallery is filled to the brim with high quality stock photographs that have inspired deviants to get creative, and turn the already beautiful images into something magical. Jessica always takes time to reach out to deviants, providing contests and nurturing other artists. We're inspired by her selfless attitude and dedication to a genre that we couldn't create without.

**The genie from the milk bottle 2**There it was, hanging from Amanda's chest: A pair of smooth breasts, shaped into such a perfectly spherical form it looked like someone had molded them in meticulous detail work. Despite the firmness that made them stick out proudly from the body attached to them their flesh gave slightly in to the hands that wandered over them. Softly the tender meat was caressed as the fingers wandered from the fabric on the flanks to the skin revealed in the cleavage, kneading the breasts like a baker his dough. Amanda rubbed her palms over her sensitive mounds, wondering how large they were. Grapefruits? Cantaloupes? It was something in between that was s](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/The-genie-from-the-milk-bottle-2-311517078)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Short and Sweet**Lilly wasn't really a snoopy girl. But when she coincidentally witnessed as her mother received a package at the garden gate from the postman, and then went back into the house, acting all secret as if she wanted nobody to see her bringing some package into the house, and when Lilly afterwards spotted her putting a load of red bonbons from the package into a jar that she hid on top of the highest shelf in the kitchen, it was enough to make the short girl move a chair under said shelf, put a pile of books on top of it and step onto the books to reach for the jar.  
  
"Come on", Lilly murmured. She raised herself on the very tips of her toes, stre](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Short-and-Sweet-306536048)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Tooth fairy meets Boob fairy I**It was a warm summer night in a little town. Moonlight streamed through the half-open window into the bedroom of a small house, bathing the bed inside it in a dim silver sheen. Underneath the blanket a woman was peacefully sleeping, breathing softly as she lay on her back. As it was a warm night she had only covered herself with her blanket up to her belly, leaving her chest and arms free. Between her small, yet decently shaped breasts the four buttons of her light blue pyjama top were resting, all being closed. Slightly they went up and down with each breath the woman made, rising and falling in a slow, steady rhythm. She barely made a sound](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Tooth-fairy-meets-Boob-fairy-I-330773257)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Breaking the writer's block(and bra)**Slowly the noise of stretching fabric filled the room as the dress widened under the swelling spheres within. Still numbed from the shock Roxanne stumbled backwards, almost tripping over the spell book she had dropped earlier. Her back hit one of the numerous book shelves in the library, forcing her stop. Pressing her hands against the books the wizard student nervously looked at her breasts, watching them grow from ripe cantaloupes towards larger sorts of melons, being far bigger than the formerly lithe girl had intended them to become. The cut in her already revealing dress widened under the increasing bulk of her buns while the pressure be](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Breaking-the-writer-s-block-and-bra-341655872)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Mammary Mentality**�Doctor, I�m obsessed with boobs!�  
  
Through her rectangular glasses Quinn looked up from her notepad to the man lying on the red couch in front of her. Sitting on her office chair her legs were crossed, partly out of habit, partly so her patient couldn�t peek under her knee-long grey skirt that lay tightly around her thighs and hips. Dark nylon thighs covered her smooth legs, and she wore black high-heels on her small feet. �It is true that during our little sessions you have revealed several aspects of your personality hold a particular interest in the exclusive charm of a woman�s body, especially when the](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Mammary-Mentality-337778591)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Bikini Body**"Okay, I've added the cat-ears. Now, do you think I'd look better with a bunny nose or a bird beak?" The 22-year old college girl shifted a little on her couch so she could hold her pencil better, while making a few alterations on the semi-anthropomorphic sketch of herself. Between her right shoulder and ear she was holding a telephone from which she impatiently awaited a reply. Meanwhile, the other occupant of the couch looked up at her with a similarly impatient look in her eyes. "I swear I've already fed you twice today, Mitty", she told her begging pet.  All the black cat responded was "meow" before getting up and jumping off th](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Bikini-Body-251846519)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**True love only grows II**The sound as Britney clicked on the left mouse button was soft and could only be heard for a split second. In her ears however it echoed like a bursting thunder. Letting go of the mouse she raised her hand, putting it on the side of her bosom. Her eyes fixed on the blue bar she eagerly stared at the screen, softly stroking the wide flanks of her bust. The surface of her palms scratched over the jagged rim of the tears, rubbing the fabric faster and harder the longer she waited for her meaty mounds to swell against her palms. As nothing happened for several seconds however she slowed down her caressing, while the corners of her mouth were drop](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/True-love-only-grows-II-361650515)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**A Witchy Accident**"Lalala-lala~♪"  
  
The lovely voice of a young lady echoed through the bathroom, filling it with a cheerful melody. Inside a full bathtub the source of the music, a young woman in her early twenties was taking a bath, chirping this little tune while she thoroughly rubbed some foam over her leg. The water pearled off her skin as she stretched her leg into the air, reflecting the light of the ceiling lamp and the full moon that was shining through the window. "Ah, there's nothing like a hot bath", the woman sighed. The tips of her purple hair sunk into the water as she put her head back a little and glided a little deeper into the bathtub.](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/A-Witchy-Accident-272934324) [![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)
**Wendy's Wish**Wendy looked in awe at her reflection in the mirror. Instead of the small girl she was used to see she looked at the image of a grown-up teenager, being around the same age and height as the other girls in the guild. Her hair, tied with red ribbons into two pigtails was smooth and voluminous, while her face had lost its childish appearance and had taken on a somewhat mysterious, and what was more important very beautiful expression. Her dark blue socks that went up to her knees rested smoothly on her long and sleek legs, a pair of plump and juicy thighs looking out above, barely covered by her pleated grey mini-skirt. Hugging her cute bubble](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/art/Wendy-s-Wish-356926597)

**Picture Perfect**Picture Perfect  
  
"Smile!"  
  
Sonia clicked the shutter button on her camera, recording the scene before her in its digital memory. Photography was her favorite pastime. To her it wasn't just simply pointing a camera and pressing a button, but a work of art that captures the timeless beauty of an individual into a form that will exist forever. Photos weren't just pictures, but memories. Memories splashed beautifully onto a digital canvas and brightened with a smile. That's what these photos were to her, no matter how simple they would seem to anybody else.

**Blooming Violette**Lettie had been on Facebook after the day's lessons.  Being home-schooled was really getting to be a pain, and the worst part was the lack of social contact.  Except for Cat and her brother, Ty, she hadn't seen much of anybody in awhile, and Ty was mostly coming over because he was crushing on her.  She was lonely; the social media helped.  
  
Then she heard her mom call, "Lettie!  Cat's here!"  
  
Lettie hopped up from the netbook she was using and headed downstairs.  There was Cat, with her black hair and dark brown eyes and fair skin, smiling at her.  Lettie grinned.

**Growth Among Friends**Growth Among Friends  
  
It was just your typical Friday. I had invited my friends over for dinner, and we laughed and talked for hours like we hadn't seen each other in years (even though we saw each other just about every day). What I loved about them was that there was never a dull moment. There was always something going on and something exciting to talk about.  
  
After dinner we all gathered in the living room as we sat and talked, laughing at corny jokes and just describing what we did all week. Brad and I had recently gotten married. I've known him for just about my whole life, and I loved him more than anything.

**I Remember You**I Remember You  
  
I flipped through the pages of the Victoria�s Secret catalog almost autonomously, ogling all of the scantily clad women without a care in the world. Life on my own was great. I didn�t have to worry about anybody walking in on me while I read my magazines. I could play video games all day without anyone complaining. It was great.  
  
I tossed aside the magazine as I reached the last page, picking up my laptop to check Facebook messages. To my surprise, I had a new friend request. I thought I had already become friends with everybody I knew. I clicked the notification.

**Expanding Lingerie**Josie was about to start college and wanted some new clothes and underwear before she started her new life.  
She went to the mall and checked out the department store. Finding clothes for Josie was always easy because of her thin build. She had cute 32b cups breast, and 34" waist. The blonde picked up a few clothes, then got a cute red bra and panties she liked and went into the dressing room.  
As Josie took off her clothes and tried the lingerie, she liked the feel and look the red bra and panties gave her in the mirror, but she noticed some itching on her boobs and ass shortly after putting on the underwear. She then tried on some jeans, bu](http://citizenbjm.deviantart.com/art/Expanding-Lingerie-306081634)[![](./I3reacl_files/defaulttag2.png)

As a child Alisone was unremarkable. Pretty, but in a �2nd place in the  
 local Miss Junior Saffordton contest�  kind of way. She got chocolate on her clothes, fought with her older brother, and had a great deal of pink clothing.  
It was not until in high school at age 18 that her baby fat *finally* began to melt away, that the people around her began to notice a new kind of beauty.

**Witch's Seed- Thieves Greed**Zoe was concentrating.  
  
Her eyes were on the jump, she lowered herself down, getting ready to sprint. Her elegant body poised, her slender abdomen bent over.    
  
Running toward it she jumped into the air, pulling off two front flips and easily sticking the landing. Her coach clapped enthusiastically, smiling at her.  
  
Turning to the other girls in the room he said, "there you go, that's a perfect jump. Notice how she mastered something simple, instead of messing up on something possibly too complex." As he said this he looked over to two identical twins who were glaring at Zoe.

Sabrina and I smiled at one another as we pushed the bedroom door open. Brad was in bed watching a baseball game that was on tv, and didn't seem to notice us at first until Sabrina walked in front of the tv and around the bed.  
  
"Oh, hey."  
  
Sabrina and I giggled, "Hi, Brad!"  
  
He smiled, "How come you two seem so....cheery?"  
  
"Just happy to see you," I winked at Sabrina.  
  
"Yeah," she said. "We're just soooo happy to see you."  
  
He looked at both of us with a peculiar look, "I see. So, it's about....ten o'clock. Why is Sabrina still here? No offense, but I thought she was going home hours ago."

 The lock of the door clicked as the key was turned around. "Yes I'm gonna be late today", the woman that opened the door said into the cell phone she was holding against her ear. A large golden pendant hung from her earlobe, while a silver ring decorated he hand holding the phone. "I know the experiment is in a critical phase", she spoke calmly into the receiver as she entered her house, her slim lipstick-garnished red mouth moving gracefully with each of her words. "But I'm sure you can handle one morning without me. Yes, it is urgent. Yes, it is about her. Thank you, Tai! I owe you something! I'll see you later at work. Bye!" She pressed the hang-up button with her thumb, the nail of it and all her fingers shining in a glaring red. The black pearls on the wristlet of her left hand rattled slightly as she put the cell phone into the pocket of her skirt. Despite lying relatively tight on her the sides of her long-sleeved red cotton jacket were bouncing slightly as she walked quickly through her living room. The jacket was agitated by the pair of breasts shown generously in the neck of woman's blouse, rubbing gently against the fabric and the inside of her black bra as they made a leap with each of her steps. The last button of the blue blouse that stretched over her full bosom was resting roughly on the center of her chest, the rim of the fabric going in wide curves up to the woman shoulders and exposing a wide V-shaped cleavage. Their bounces then calmed down as the woman stopped in front of a door. Leaning a little forward she pressed her ear against it. In the room behind it she could hear the low sounds of wood knocking against wood. A slight smile hushed over the lips of the woman. With her left her hand she grabbed the door knob, and slowly turned it around.  
  
The door opened ajar. Her wavy black hair graced her shoulders as the 35-year old woman peeked into the room, scanning it with her dark Asian eyes. The fine features of her make-up adorned face shined in the sunlight that streamed through the large window opposite to the door. Under it a little girl in a short-sleeved pink pyjama dress was sitting on the colourful carpet. Around her little toy bricks in all forms and colours were scattered. She picked them up one by one, sometimes two, and put them on a structure in front of her. Unnoticed by her the woman entered the room, slowly walking towards her. On the way her black high-heels stepped over various toys, from trains and cars to more bricks and some electronic game devices. With her tight dark grey skirt it was a bit troublesome to move over all the obstacles. Sneaking up on the little girl she kneeled down as she stood behind her, and leaned over her shoulder. Both her skirt and her blouse groaned slightly as she stuck out her butt to the back while her bosom hung down from her body. Curiously the woman looked at what the girl was building. In front of her stood a construction made out of two towers that were going upwards in a spiral around each other. The order of the bricks was following a strict pattern that constantly repeated itself: A yellow rectangular block, then a blue cylinder, an orange brick like the first and then another blue cylinder. The only difference between the two towers was the order of the orange and yellow blocks were switched. Each yellow brick of one tower was connected with the orange block of the other on the same height by long pillar-like bricks in various colours. The whole construction looked very instable, but the little girl seemed to have no trouble adding another level to it. "What are you building there, sweety?", the woman asked the girl.  
  
The girl placed another blue brick on top of a yellow one, a bit shifted so the spiral would continue. "I'm rebuilding the TATA-box of a prokaryote promoter", she replied. Without looking at the woman she searched for another orange block.  
  
The woman chuckled. "Can you really construct a piece of DNA with a few toy blocks?", she asked amused.  
  
The little girl eventually found the block she searched. "I had to grind them a little so the hydrogen bridges would connect the corresponding bases and give the molecule stability", she calmly stated as she put the brick in its place.  
  
The woman shook her head, but still smiled. "Now sweetie, you know you aren't allowed to use tools without surveillance of an adult", she told her. It was not in a consulting tone though, more a kind reminder than a command. Looking over her shoulder the woman quietly watched as the little girl added another level to her DNA tower. Even with the adjustments she had made it looked like a miracle to the woman the complex didn't fall apart. "Your teacher called me", she eventually said to her daughter. "Why didn't you go to school today?"  
  
"School's boring", the little girl bluntly answered while taking the next brick. "I'm always done with the teachers' tasks way before everyone else, and then I sit around for most of the lesson and play with my pens. So I thought I could also stay here and play with my bricks. That's more fun."   
  
The woman leaned a little closer to her daughter. "And that is all?", she asked.  
  
The little girl picked up another brick, but hesitated to put it in its place. Instead she put it on her lap. "Well, that and�" Her fingers tapped on the wooden block while she bit her lip. "I don't like the other kids", she finally admitted. "They always tease me."  
  
The woman leaned even further forward. Her bosom stretched her top further, slightly spilling over the hem of its neckline. "Why are they teasing you?", she inquired. "Is it because you are so smart?"  
  
The little girl put down the brick in her hand. She turned around, sitting on her knees as she looked up into the eyes of her mother. Their faces looked almost identical, except for the apparent difference in age. "Mommy, why don't I have a father?" the little girl asked.  
  
Silently the woman cast her glance downwards at the colourful carpet, a strained smile on her lips. Holding out her arms she then wrapped them around the body of her daughter. The little girl could smell the perfume of her mother as her head was pressed against her bosom, engulfing her face in its comfortable warmth. "I'm sorry, sweetie", the woman apologized to her child. With her right hand she softly stoke over her back. "I've tried to get along with some men from work, searched dating sites, tried blind dates, but� it never worked out." She took in a deep breath, the girl feeling the ample chest blowing up slightly and squeezing a bit more against her face until her mother let out a sigh. "I guess most men are just scared to be in a relationship with the world's leading geneticist."  
  
Inside her arms the woman could feel the little girl shivering a little. She pushed her head out from its soft cushion, looking with big worried eyes up into the face of her mother. "Are they scared because of me?", she asked. "Because� because I'm a clone of you?"  
  
The stressed smile of the woman grew softer. Leaving one hand on the back of her daughter she put the other one on her chin, lowering her head so their dark eyes were almost on the same height. "My sweet beloved Mi, it has absolutely nothing to do with you", she said with the most kind and warm voice. "And even if, I would never want to live with a man who can't love my precious sweetheart as much as I do." She put her arms back around her daughter, and pressed her cheek against hers. "I'm sorry", she whispered into her ear. A lone tear flowed down from her right eye, running down her face until the drop of saltwater dried out. "When you were born eight years ago� when I cloned myself and gave birth to you I didn't do it to test out my hypothesis and gain fame. I just wanted a child � from the bottom of my heart, I wanted a child so I had someone I could pour all my love into, so that once I'm old I'll have more than just academic reputation and a few prices for messing with bio-molecules and cells to look back to and be proud of. But I didn't want to bind myself to a man. I thought I had to keep my independence. I wanted to prove I was able to raise a child and be a successful scientist at the same time." Pulling her head back the woman put both her hands on the cheeks of her daughter, softly stroking them while looking at her with wet eyes. "I'm really ashamed now for thinking like that back then. I only thought of myself, never about how you would feel without a father. I'm sorry."  
  
The little girl wrapped her arms around the back of her mother, pressing her head back into her warm bosom again. "It's okay, Mom", she assured her. "It's just so� lonely sometimes. You're at work all day, and no other kids ever want to play with me. Most of them are scared when they read on Wikipedia that I'm the only clone child in the world, or hear about me from their parents. Everyone avoids me in school, and when I'm home, I usually have nobody to play with but my bricks too."  
  
With a smile the woman put one hand on the back of her daughter and the other one on her head. Gently she stroked her daughter's short black hair, pressing her head deeper against her ample chest. "Maybe we can do something about that", she mumbled to herself.  
  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   
  
The first thing she heard was a rhythmic beat. It was a very steady rhythm, a constant throbbing with a few longer breaks in between. Closely she listened to it, trying to identify the source of the sound. At the same time she felt like something was pounding against her chest from the inside. My heart, it suddenly struck her, my heart is making that beat. It was her heart-beat. She then noticed another sound, also very rhythmic, but slower. After listening to it for a while she also found it was coming from her, but not her chest. Eventually she realised that it was her breathe blowing out of her nose. Chest. Nose. That's right, she thought, those were parts of her body. What else was her body made of? Words came to her mind, though she didn't understand their meaning at first: Arms, legs, belly, head� and on her head, there was her nose, and also her mouth, her ears, and her eyes. Her eyes she could use to see. See, that was something like hearing, which she did with her ears. But to see, she had to open her eyes.  
  
Her eye-lids twitched slightly. It took a while until she had a real feeling for them, slowly opening them. Once her eyes were open however she still couldn't see much. Dark, she thought, it was dark around her. The only thing she saw was a rough surface beneath her and two things lying in front of her. They were long and reaching away from her body, with a weird clump at the end. It took a while until she realised that those were her arms As if to prove herself these were really parts of her body she tried to move them. At first her left elbow jittered a little. Slowly then she dragged her entire arm over the rough surface. The word "floor" then struck her, and immediately she knew it was the rough surface. She was lying, she thought, lying on the floor. The floor� Carefully she turned her arm so that her � hand, that was the name of the clump at the end of her arms, so that her hand was lying flat on the floor. It felt somehow inconvenient to touch it. Unpleasant. It was rough, scratching her hand, and it felt� cold. The word suddenly had popped up in her mind, and she knew it was corresponding to the feeling of the floor. Her understanding of the word then quickly grew beyond the floor. "Opposite to hot and warm", it came into her mind, "snow", "freeze", and all kind of other words. Those words then quickly dragged more terms after them: Winter, snowman, weather, rain, lightning, electricity, toaster � soon she had trouble to distinguish them. Her head was spinning from the overload of words, being almost unable to keep track of them. And constantly more words popped up, words like "sheep", "transcendent", "puppet" and "seven". At the same time she began to see images in her mind, pictures of all kinds of objects, animals, numbers and hundreds of other things.   
  
At first the sheer flood of information was overwhelming, even scaring her. Her limbs grew stiff, and a slight shiver went through her body. It took a while until she could sort everything out and connect all the words with the right pictures. As she opened her eyes again she had a better understanding of her environment. Slowly she raised her head, her black hair hanging down to the floor as she was still lying on the side. She moved her arms under her body, her motions a bit awkward at first. Bit by bit she began to learn how to move them properly, getting a better feeling for all of her body. One arm she moved behind her back, the other one next to her face, and put her hands on the floor. Her arms trembled as she slowly pushed her body into an upright position, the weak muscles in them being put under stress. Eventually she sat with her knees on the ground, leaning against her arms, hair falling into her face as her head she was looking downwards. She noticed her breathing was faster than before, and going through her mouth instead of her nose. One word suddenly popped up in her mind, one that she immediately associated with her current situation: Birth. She had just been born.  
  
A clicking sound then cut into her thoughts. A few feet in front of her something was appearing in the darkness appearing, and it was steadily growing larger. The words "door", "being opened" and "light" were coming to her, but it took a while until she bound it together into "a door opened and light was shining into the room". She narrowed her sensitive eyes as the bright light blinded her, her shoulders stiffening slightly as she looked to the door. There was a huge black figure � a silhouette � standing inside it. The shape of the shadow reminded her of something, before she realised it was the shade of another person. That was right � she was a person, but aside from her there were many more in the world. And one was standing in the door. As she got used to the light she tried to get a better look at the person in the door. She was tall, far taller than her, though her hair was roughly the same length as it fell down her shoulders. There was something different about this person, she thought, something that distinguished the two of them. Maybe it was because of the objects that covered her body? Clothes, it struck her, the things on her body were clothes. In the same moment she realised the person wore clothes she also realised that she was naked. Upon seeing the clothes the person wore the term for each came to her mind, as well as its colour. Around her torso she wore a red jacket. Over her legs she wore a dark grey skirt ending at her knees. On her feet was a pair of white socks and black pointy shoes. Beneath her jacket she wore a blue top that was closed with a series of buttons. At the top it left something of her body uncovered, a pair of round things that hugged each other inside the top. The term she associated with it was "breast", but something was strange about that. Looking down on herself she found she didn't have those balls, although she called that region of her body the same. Looking at the person's breast again she could see them something pressing against the blue fabric of her top, something dark. It was also a piece of cloth, she was sure, but she found no word for it. As she looked at the tall person in the door the words "adult" and "woman" eventually came to her mind. That person was an adult, a woman. At the same time she realised she herself was a child, a little girl, the exact opposite. Through the much brighter room she then saw the mouth of the woman moving. "Can you hear me?", she could hear at the same time she saw her mouth move. There was a connection, she thought. As she had moved her mouth, she had made those sounds. She had "spoken", she had "talked" to her. Slowly the little girl began to understand the meaning behind the concepts of speech and of words like "speak" and "talk", while at the same time the knowledge of how to do it herself flowed into her mind.   
  
"Y�Y�Y�" Her lips quivered as she tried to form them so she could produce different vocals. "Ye�Ye� Yes", she eventually brought out.  
  
The woman walked into the room, the little girl hearing a clapping sound whenever she made a step with her high pointy shoes. Standing in front of the little girl the woman bent forward. As she leaned down towards the little girl the balls in her top began to pull a little tighter against the fabric, the little girl watching them hang down and sway slightly in front of her. "How are you feeling?", the woman asked further.  
  
"Co...cold", the little girl replied, still having some trouble to form words with her lips.   
  
The woman sat down in front of her, the fabric relaxing around the balls in her top. With a quick motion she stripped out of her jacket, revealing her blouse was short-sleeved beneath it, and put it around the little girl's shoulders. Pleasant warmth engulfed her as the fabric hugged her body, the cold feeling quickly decreasing. She closed her eyes, pulling the jacket closer around her. "Better?", the woman asked. The little girl nodded. A gesture to show approval, she thought in the same moment she did it. "Your name is Ailin", the woman told her.  
  
Slowly the little girl "remembered" the concept of what a name was. "Ai�lin", she repeated.  
  
The woman nodded. "My name is Juna", she explained. With the back of her hand she softly stroked the cheek of the little girl. "But you know what you can call me instead, right?", she asked with a smile.  
  
Indeed, as she looked at the woman in front of her, another word popped up inside Ailin's mind. It wasn't like any of the other words she had just "learned" however.  There was a deeper meaning behind it. A strong emotional bond was attached to this word, some kind of comforting warmth that went along with it. Instinctively Ailin pulled her arms around the woman, pressing her head against her chest. "Mommy", she murmured, hugging the soft chest of her mother.  
  
Smiling her mother put her own arms around Ailin. She leaned her head forward, her cheek cuddling the hair on top of her daughter's head. "I'm so glad", she whispered. The tone in her voice made Ailin memorise what "relief" meant. "They all say I'm a genius and that it would definitely work, but I was still worried sick about you. This method has never been used on a human before. You are the first clone child in the world that was artificially aged and enhanced with memories of its parent." Ailin didn't completely understand what her mother had said, but after a while the definition of "clone" came to her mind. Her mother then pointed her hand away from her body. A gesture to show her something, Ailin thought and turned her head into the direction her mother was pointing at. In the corner of the room a large object was standing. Ailin didn't know what it was, but its shape reminded her of a "cylinder", and its material of the word "glass". At first she thought it was empty, but looking closely at it she found it was filled with something that she thought of as "clear liquid". "For the past twelve weeks you have been swimming inside this glass tank, darling", her mother explained. "Do you remember to have climbed out?" Remembering what the opposite of nodding was the girl shook her head. "I see. So your consciousness wasn't fully developed when your nervous system became active." Already engulfed in the warmth of her mother's chest Ailin's head face was pushed deeper against the soft balls as her mother wrapped her arms tighter around her. "Poor thing!", she said. "You must have managed to climb out of the tank, but then became unconscious again and collapsed on the floor. I hope you didn't lie around here for too long."  
  
Ailin didn't say anything, but simply let herself be hugged by her mother. Another word popped up in her mind. She didn't quite know what it meant though. The only thing she knew about that word was she felt warm when thinking about it. "Love", Ailin whispered, so low her mother didn't hear it.  
  
After a while her mother pulled her body back. Holding Ailin's shoulders she looked her in the eyes. "Listen, this is the first time this method has been used on a human", she told her. "The tests with lizards, sheep and monkeys have all been positive, so there should be no risks or side-effects. But if you fell any kind of discomfort, please let me know immediately. Okay?" Ailin nodded, though she didn't quite understand everything her mother had just said. "Good." Again her mother pressed her against her chest. "Darling, you have no idea how scared I was when I saw you lying on the floor just now." Keeping her hands on her daughter's back she began to stand up. As her chest left her face Ailin saw the balls in her mother's shirt hanging in front her. "Can you walk?", she asked. Walk. Some rough memories had popped up in her mind when she had seen her mother walk over to her, and after hearing the word they were sharpening. Quietly Ailin nodded. I have to stand up first, she thought. For the first time she tried to move her legs. Her feet twitched slightly, Ailin needing some time to get used to using her muscles in them. Dragging one leg over the floor she brought it into a position in which the sole of her foot was lying on the floor like her hands earlier when she had sat up. Sitting on the ground with one knee and one foot on the floor she felt the arms of her mother moving over her back down to her arms until reaching her hands. "Careful there", she said as she took her daughter's hands. Very cautious and slowly she pulled on Ailin's arms, moving them above her head. With the help of her mother the little girl managed to put her other foot on the ground as well, and in little steps the two brought her whole body into an upright position. Her legs trembled as they had to hold her weight for the first time. Feeling insecure in her standing Ailin held the hands of her mother even tighter. "It's okay", she comforted her daughter. "You'll get used to it quickly."  
  
After a few moments in which her legs felt incredibly soft and weak their shaking slowly came to a halt. Though she was a little nervous Ailin let go of her mother's hands. Her body tilted a little to the side, but quickly she managed to regain her balance. Carefully then Ailin raised her leg to make a step forward. In the moment when she stood on just one leg her foot shook so strongly she thought to fall over, and immediately put her other foot back on the ground. Both legs shook a little as she put it down, but she didn't feel like she would fall over anymore. Staring on her legs that were still slightly trembling she suddenly felt her mother taking her by the hand again.   
  
"Come", she said with a smile. With the guidance of her mother the two of them step by step walked towards the door. "There is someone who can't wait to meet you."

A little sceptical Ailin looked down on herself. Her slim child body was dressed in a pyjama dress with short sleeves that only barely went past her shoulders. The hole for her head was rather wide, ending below her collarbone in a circular line. Ailin tugged at the skirt of her pyjama dress that went down to her knees, leaving her lower legs and cute little feet bare. The baby pink fabric was conveniently slack, ruffling slightly everytime she turned her body. Still, despite the comfortable feeling the loose fabric provided her the young girl felt uncomfortable inside it. "Why do we have to wear clothes?", she mumbled to herself. "Being naked was cold, but somehow felt more... more�" Ailin pondered for a moment, searching the right word. Her little fingers scratched her head, rubbing over the little red butterfly ribbon that was tucked into her hair. "Free", she said after a while. She couldn't really say though that the dress constricted her, as loose at it was. Her main concern wasn't the pyjama anyway, but the white underpants she wore beneath. It was also far away from being taught, lying relatively relaxed around her small flat cheeks. Still, wearing something over her butt felt somehow weird to her.  
  
While looking down her plain dress she could hear footsteps behind her, alongside a childish giggle. "Don't be so whiny, Ai", she could hear her sister say. "Or I'll have to cheer you up with force!" A pair of hands quickly slipped through under Ailin's shoulders. Placed on her chest the fingers began to hastily move over it, like wildly dancing worms. Feeling the tips of her sister's fingers on her chest a weird feeling spread through her, not painful, but inconvenient. Even before the word "tickle" popped up in her mind Ailin was already laughing loudly, trying to shake off her sister that had sneaked up from behind.  
  
"Hey, stop it, sis!", she screamed between laughs. As she softly punched backwards with her elbows her sister eventually let go off her and pulled back. Still laughing Ailing turned around on the spot, looking her sister in her face that was dominated by a cheerful smile. She wore the same ribbon as Ailin on her head, only hers was blue. As the two of them stood opposite to each other it looked like a mirror had been placed between them. Face, body, height, clothes � the only things separating them were the colour of their ribbons and the length of their hair, Mi's being cut short while Ailin's reached to her shoulders. As the two of them stood there and smiled at each other the door to the children's room opened, and the sisters turned their heads to see someone entering. Before she could step with both feet onto the colourful carpet their mother was already assaulted by her happily screaming daughters, hugging her closely around her waist. Laughing the woman put a hand on each of their heads, stroking them as they pressed their faces against her body.  
  
"All right my little sweethearts, it's time to go to bed", she kindly told them. Almost at the same time her two little girls let go of her. They ran over to their beds, followed by their mother who walked in a little more reserved way, partly because she still wore the tight skirt. Climbing onto their beds that stood a few feet apart from each other the little girls crawled under their blankets. Since she did it for the first time it took a while until Ailin fought a little with hers. In the meantime their mother sat down on the bed next to Mi. The little girl was lying peacefully under her blanket, grinning up at her mother's face. "So how was the first the day with your sister?", she asked while pulling the blanket up to her daughter's neck.  
  
"It was so fun!", Mi chirped. "She's like already my best friend in the world! And I can't wait to play more with her for tomorrow!"  
  
Her mother smoothed the blanket. "Now, sweety, don't forgot tomorrow is Monday and you have to go school", she reminded her. Immediately Mi frowned.  
  
"Aw, do I have to?", she asked, sounding more than a bit disappointed. "I wanna play more with Ai! Besides, a big sister must take care of her younger sister!"  
  
Her mother chuckled. "Physically, Ailin is actually a few months older than you", she informed her daughter. She put a hand on the side of her face, softly stroking her cheek. "But, since you have skipped school so many times already, I guess one more day to get to know your sister better may really not hurt." Mi's face immediately brightened up, shining with a bright smile. Smiling back her mother stood up from the mattress. Turning around she saw Ailin still had trouble with her blanket. She sat down next to her and took it in her hands. "And how was the day for you?", she asked while she covered her daughter. "The first day of your life?"  
  
Ailin felt as the blanket was put over her entire body, only leaving the head free. She smiled up to her mother. "It was great!", she exclaimed, her voice beaming with excitement and her eyes gleaming with joy. "Sis and I played the whole day! We played with balls! And bricks! And blankets! And we played hide-and-seek! I hid in a closet and almost won, but then I had to sneeze and sis found me! And then we played tag, and then with sis' toy cars! And we played mother and child! And�" Ailin wanted to tell her mother so much more about how much fun she had that day and about all the games Mi had shown her. But instead a loud yawn left her mouth.   
  
Her mother giggled. "Sleep a little, my dear", she told her. "You need the energy for tomorrow." She evened the folds on the blanket, but kept looking Ailin into the face, looking a little more serious. "Ailin, you'll have to stay in the house with your sister for the time being. I don't want anyone to find out about you yet. They'll just make a ruckus out of you like they did with Mi." Finished with the blanket she put her hand on the face of her daughter. "But don't worry. I won't imprison you in the house for the rest of your life. In a few days a colleague of me will use the same method of cloning on himself, and then all the reporters' eyes will be on him. After the commotion about it has calmed down I will announce that I also have cloned myself a second daughter. It'll be like someone reported a bag of rice has fallen down somewhere in China." She leaned a little closer towards Ailin, looking her deeply in the eyes. "In a few weeks you can leave the house and go freely around, darling. I'll also register you for the same school as Mi then."  
  
As she heard the word "school" and all of the memories her mother had related to it when she had been eight years old were coming to her mind, Ailin kind of wished she could stay in the house.  
  
Her mother stood up. "I'll also go to bed now", she told both of her daughters. "It was a long day, and I have to get up early tomorrow." She turned toward Mi, leaning over her face. "Good night, sweety", she said and gave her a kiss on the forehead. Turning around she bent over Ailin. Once more that day the balls in her top hung in the little girl's sight as she as she gave her a soft kiss on the forehead as well. Ailin felt comfortable warmth as the lips touched her forehead. She had to think of the word "love" again. Pulling her head back her mother looked her in the eyes. Her face radiated with the happiest smile Ailin had ever seen in her short life. "Good night, darling."  
  
Ailin watched her mother walk to the half-open door, her butt swaying slightly, almost unnoticeably with each of her steps inside her formfitting skirt. The little girl wondered if her mother did this on purpose or if everyone was moving their butt this way when walking. As she stood at the door their mother turned one more time towards her daughters, blowing a kiss into their direction. It got suddenly dark in the room as she turned off the lights. A ray of light was still shining through the door, steadily shrinking as their mother closed it. As it was completely shut it was almost completely dark in the room, only the pale light of the moon shining through the large window.  
  
As their mother was gone Mi turned under blanket. Lying on her shoulder she looked at her sister. "So, how does it feel?", she asked her.  
  
Ailin also turned her head to the side. "What do you mean?", she asked back.  
  
"Mom told me you would be getting some of her memories from time to time", Mi said. "How does it feel like when you get one?"  
  
Ailin had to ponder for a moment. "Well, it's hard to explain", she slowly began, trying to find the right words to describe it. "When I see or hear something it's like words suddenly pop up in my head. I first don't get what they mean, but then it slowly becomes clear to me."  
  
"Like remembering the flavour of an ice cream you didn't eat for a long time?", her sister asked.  
  
"Maybe", Ailin responded. She made a thoughtful face. "What's ice cream?... No wait, I just remembered." The two of them giggled like the little girls they were. Suddenly Ailin's expression got more serious. "Sis, I wanna ask you something."  
  
"Anything you want, Ai!", Mi chirped. "I'm your big sister, you can ask me everything!"  
  
 Ailin took in a deep breath. "You� are also a clone of mom, right?"   
  
"Yeah, but I'm not like you", she told her. She turned back on her back, looking up at the ceiling that looked like the starry night sky. "Eight years ago Mom didn't know how to transfer memories or raise people in a tank. So even though I'm a clone, I grew up pretty much like any other kid. I lived for a few months in Mom's belly, was born as a baby, and got older like a normal child."  
  
"But you're also a clone?", Ailin inquired. Her sister nodded. "So if we both are Mom's clones then� then are we both Mom?"  
  
Mi shook her head. "I also asked her that while you were in the tank", she explained her. "She said that while we are both clones, we are completely different persons. I for example am not like her when she was our age, because I wasn't raised like she was back then, and grew up in a different time and environment."  
  
"But what about me?", Ailin asked, sitting up slightly. "You were born as a baby, but I'm already eight years old. And I have Mom's memories from when she was eight. Am I just a copy of her?"  
  
Mi scratched her head. "I asked her that too", she replied. "She said something like even though you have some of her memories, it is up to you how you read them since you haven't got her personality or any private memories, only definitions of words and stuff. And that from the day you were born, you would start to make your own memories." Mi pushed off the blanket from her body. Ailin watched as she stood up from her bed and walked over to hers. "I didn't really understand everything she said to me, actually. But I understand one thing." Her sister took Ailin's hand, holding it tightly with both of hers. "That you are my sister, and thanks to you, I'll never be alone again", she smiled at her. "You have no idea how happy I am you are here, Ai."  
  
Ailin put her second hand around her sister's. The word "love" struck her again, and slowly, she began to understand what it meant. "I'm also happy I have you, sis." The two of them stood there for a while, smiling at each other. Ailin almost didn't want to let got as her sister went back to her bed, crawling under her blanket again. Once more she looked at her sister, still bearing that warm smile on her face.  
  
"Night, Ai", she said, closing her eyes.  
  
Ailin lay her head down on her pillow. "Night, sis", she murmured, already starting to fall asleep.  
  
The two little girls peacefully slept inside their beds, softly breathing. It was around midnight when Ailin began to move under her blanket, her arms and legs twitching slightly. Her peaceful face took on a stressed grimace. "Ngh�" Growling she turned around, again and again, rolling her head on the pillow while wrapping the blanket tighter and tighter around her. "Ungh�" Slowly Ailin opened her eyes. Her sight was a little blurry at first. She sat up on her bed, leaning herself against the pillow behind her while putting one hand on her forehead. There was a strange feeling inside her head, a pounding, but it wasn't like her heart-beat. This one was� was� painful. The word "dizzy" came to her mind. Pulling off the blanket from her she sat down on the edge of the mattress. Some of her hair fell into her face as she leaned forward. Rubbing her temples with both hands more words popped up in Ailin's head, but she didn't like any of them: Sickness, headache, disease, illness � even worse than the meaning of the words was they all seemed to describe how she felt in that moment pretty well.  
  
In the other bed the blanket of her sister also moved slightly. Having woken up from her sister's turmoil Mi slowly sat up as well, pushing off the blanket from her upper-body. "What's wrong, Ai?", she asked, rubbing her eyes.   
  
Ailin looked up to her sister's tired face. "I'm feeling a little dizzy", she told her. Listening to herself she found to sound weak, slack, and her throat was hurting slightly as she spoke.   
  
Her sister suddenly looked a lot more awake. She pushed off the blanket from her legs and sat down like Ailin on the edge of her bed. Ailin felt a slight vibration in the floor as Mi jumped off from the mattress, walking with her bare feet over to her sister's bed. "Mommy said to tell her if something's wrong with you, Ai", her sister reminded her. Softly she took one of Ailin's hands that was rubbing her head and embraced it. As she tightly held it Ailin felt the weight and meaning of this gesture: Mi was trying to comfort both of them with it.  
  
Despite feeling bad Ailin smiled at her sister. "Could you go and wake her up please?", she asked her.   
  
Quietly her sister smiled back, putting both her hands around Ailin's. "Wait right here", she said. She let go of her as she turned towards the door, Ailin's hand suddenly feeling empty. Quickly Mi ran to the door, opening it with her tiny hands. Before she left she glanced one more time at her sister, smiling at her. Ailin could then hear her running down the hallway, calling "Mom!" on the way to their mother's bedroom.  
  
Still feeling sick Ailin was sitting alone on her bed in the dark room, waiting for Mi to return with their mother. The house was rather large, so it would probably take one or two minutes until they were back. "I'll switch on the lights", she told herself. Carefully she pushed herself off from the edge of the mattress, her small feet silently landing on the floor. As she stood on her feet her legs began to tremble. Her upper-body was leaning in different directions by itself as she had trouble to maintain her balance. She flailed her arms, feeling each move was strengthening the pounding in her head. She took a clumsy step forward, her body tilting so far to the side she almost fell over. Quickly she reached out her arm towards the wall next to her, but it was too short to reach it. Turning her head she staggered towards it, almost tripling over her own feet in the process. As her hand almost touched the colourful wallpaper with the flower pattern however she suddenly froze on the spot. Her legs were crossed, and her body was tilting slightly to the side. She didn't care about that though. Even the sick feeling she forgot for a short moment, for her whole concentration was lying on her outstretched arm.   
  
It was growing.   
  
Unbelievingly Ailin stared at her hand getting further away from her body. It was only by a few millimeters per second, but she could clearly see it reaching out from her as her arm lengthened. Even more she could feel the muscles and bones in her arm stretch, slowly extending towards the wall. As she looked at her other arm she found it was growing as well, also in a low pace, but still noticeably. Looking down on her hand she noticed her small chubby fingers were getting longer as well, and though the change was too subtle to see felt her palm becoming bigger as well. A sensation of fear and shock overcame the young girl. Staring in confusion at her arms she suddenly had a feeling as if the room was sinking. Her whole body was still trembling, making it hard for her to tell if she just hallucinated as her head constantly shifted its position. Slowly Ailin stumbled towards the wall, making one unsure step after the other. Walking over the carpet she had a weird feeling in her feet, as if her soles were rubbing over it, and a weird sensation in her legs made it even harder to walk. She leaned herself against the wallpaper with her upper arm, feeling it swell slightly against its rough surface. The shaking in her body subsided, making it easier for her to take a look around the dark room. The bed next to her appeared to steadily sink lower while the wall was also gliding downwards, Ailin seeing as the flowers above her were moving into her direction. It really seemed like the room was shrinking.   
  
"No" she whispered to herself. She had a feeling that wasn't true, and glanced down her body. Below the hem of her skirt she saw her knees bit by bit coming into sight, sliding over the fabric. The feeling of her feet pressing against the carpet steadily increased, while it seemed like the distance between them and her knees slowly extended. Her belly, chest, it all seemed to be rising upwards, all of her body parts gradually becoming longer, and, as she could see, a little wider as well. Staring at herself she could feel the swelling sensation she had noticed in her arms everywhere in her, from her face down her torso into the tips of her toes. Around her body Ailin felt her pink pyjama dress slowly growing tighter, the loose fabric steadily losing its comfortable slack. Her sleeves rose up towards her shoulders while the hem of her skirt continued to rise over her knees, soon uncovering her gradually swelling thighs. Underneath her still fluttery skirt they were not only getting longer like her lower legs, but their circumference increased as well, growing steadily meatier. At the same time Ailin could feel her butt arching behind her against the confines of her skirt, making itself more apparent. Rising like bread in an oven their roundings steadily became more pronounced, more voluminous and rounder. Though it was slowly Ailin could feel her butt-covering panties stretching over her cheeks, uncovering their edges as they slowly slid over their arching curves. As the sides of her butt were also swelling to the sides the hips of the slender girl were flaring along, increasing the difference to her waist. Feeling her butt and thighs getting thicker confused her even more than the general growth of the rest of her body. Unlike the parts of her lower half her middle section was almost only growing in length, the position of her belly button getting steadily higher while her waist remained rather slim.   
  
As her body stretched towards the ceiling Ailin's field of vision was slowly expanding, giving her a gradually better view on her surroundings. With her eyes going up she could see the flowers on the wallpaper from a higher perspective while the surface of her bed came more and more into sight, Ailin seeing the ruffled blanket that covered half of the mattress. The more she looked around the more her whole perspective on the room was changing, looking smaller by the second. Meanwhile Ailin felt a weird itching in her face, and saw something move in between her eyes. Closing her right eye she saw her nose was growing a little as well, getting slightly bigger. Not only that though, but her whole face was changing its appearance: Ailin could feel her puffy cheeks deflating a bit, making the contours of her face more defined while her chin was getting more pointier. Her mouth seemed to be shrinking slightly, while at the same time her lips became fuller. She twitched uncomfortably with her eyes as their lashes were extending, and her hair was brushing against her shoulders as it was getting longer as well, only so slightly it looked like it stayed the same length on her growing body. Totally shocked and confused with the situation Ailin's steadily longer legs were starting to grow numb. The young girl felt her knees giving in, her arm sliding off the wallpaper as she fell forward. Landing on her knees Ailin felt a small pain in them, but it was quickly drowned by the sensations of growth. Her lower legs pressed against the carpet while her thighs pressed against her lower legs, both becoming bit by bit bigger. Feeling each part of her body grow Ailin put a hand on her head and groaned slightly. As her fingers extended and rubbed over her forehead they were mainly growing in length, making it look like they were getting thinner. She could also feel her head press back against her hand as it blew up like a balloon, and her arms extending millimeter after millimeter, her skin-tight sleeves sliding slowly up her shoulders.  Most of her in the meantime rather thick thighs were uncovered, while her skirt hugged a cute, roughly heart-shaped bubble butt.  
  
Bubble butt? The word had suddenly popped up in Ailin's head, but she didn't understand it. When she and Mi had bathed together earlier and their mother had poured this "lotion" into the water she had remembered what a bubble was. Taking a look down her back Ailin found as she saw her cheeks reaching out, their curves steadily bulging behind her it somehow resembled the little bubbles in the bathtub that had also grown steadily bigger until they popped. An uneasy feeling overcame her as she wondered if her butt would pop as well. Worried she looked as the fabric of her skirt continued to vault, creating a steadily greater contrast to her back. She didn't even understand why it was getting thicker anyway while most other parts of her body remained their proportions. The young girl had already become a good foot taller, reaching her mother up to her belly. While Ailin watched her butt expand, looking down a steadily stretching back she noticed something in her chest. A tingle similar to when Mi had tickled her earlier, but coming from the inside. She turned her head to her front, and looked at her breast. Slowly it was bulging out from her growing torso, the fabric over it arching like her skirt. Moving out from her a small puff formed on her torso, the young girl feeling her pyjama getting dented by the skin and flesh of her chest that was pushing out.  
  
Ailin stared at her bloating chest in confusion, watching as a gradually bigger bump formed on her upper body. Only slowly the growing girl realised her chest was not reaching out as a whole, but two separate swells were starting to stand out from it. From around the places where she had seen two small knobs when she had been naked earlier the meat of her chest was going up in a circular shape. Soon a pair of small hemi-spheres had formed on her chest, standing a rough centimeter out from her. They were rising faster in the middle than at the sides, giving them a dome-like shape. The area at which they moved out from her expanded evenly into all directions, their curves bending and giving the little bulges more volume. Moving out from her body their steadily rounding edges were reaching to the sides of her body as well as up- and downwards. The distance between the swells shrunk as well, the valley that separated them steadily narrowing. Again Ailin was reminded of bubbles as she watched the small mounds bulging out the previously plain fabric, smoothing it around their arching curves. Seeing them also brought the balls in her mother's dress back to her memory. The term "breasts" then popped up in her mind. At first Ailin didn't understand why she suddenly thought of the plural for "breast", but as she watched her bulges becoming bit by bit bigger, their sides vaulting and their front reaching forward, she slowly realized the word could be used to describe these balls. For a moment she wondered if the cheeks of her rounding rear could be called "butts" in that logic. She then realised to have used the word "rear" in her thoughts, but she didn't really knowing what it meant. As she was about to comprehend it as a synonym for "butt" the word "booty" struck her. Before she could even think about it "buttocks", "posterior" and another word followed. For the last one she somehow felt an inner barrier to use it, as if something was wrong with it. Dirty, she thought, the word was dirty. In that moment more words that she would describe as dirty (without really knowing what that meant) popped up in her head.  She couldn't really understand most of these words either. What was a "boob"? Or a "tit"? Why did she have the urge to only use them in plural? And was it a coincidence both words were still spelled the same when reversed?  
  
It wasn't good for her that while she thought about all this her body relentlessly continued to grow. The top of her head steadily ascended, Ailin already able to look over her bed at the ground behind it. Still sitting on her knees she felt them rubbing over the ground as her lower legs got longer, while at the same time her arms continued to extend, her hands and feet growing along. The ribbon on her head was shifting a little in its position as her hair overgrew it, becoming fuller and more voluminous by the moment. Other parts of her body were also becoming fuller and more voluminous, Ailin feeling as her pyjama steadily grew tighter around her chest. Her breasts were becoming hard not to notice, expanding from a subtle bump to a pair of apparent little mounds. As her dress stretched around them she could feel the fabric over her belly getting pulled upwards a little faster. At the same time her skirt was going up with a bit more speed as well, getting closer to the end of her legs. Without her doing her legs pressed above her knees with growing force against each other, swelling to a modestly lush pair of thighs. Above them things weren't much better with her butt still swelling behind her, although at an a little slower pace than before. Her backside had become much more prominent, sticking noticeably, but not exaggeratedly much out from the rest of her body. While sliding over her billowing cheeks she felt her underwear gliding a little down her hips, and noticed the top of her butt gap was revealed under her dress. The pyjama was growing so tight around her she was starting to see through it, especially around the puffy curves of her butt and bosom. Bosom, she suddenly thought, bosom was another word for chest or her breasts. She then felt as those breasts were starting to press slightly against each other inside her dress. At first it was only at one point, then the area steadily expanded as more of their inner sides were squeezed together, flattening the round curves a little. Feeling her breasts touch each other under the fabric was even weirder for her than wearing underpants. Which hadn't really become any better since it started to stretch around her bum.  
  
The formerly eight year old girl could reach her mother up to her chest by then. Once lying comfortably on her the fabric of her pyjama had grown rather taut around her body, making her shift uncomfortably inside her stretched clothes. Above the upper end of her dress she saw a small gap appearing as the fabric glided down over the tops of her breasts. At first she couldn't see much of the gap, but the deeper her dress slid the more of it was revealed, also showing that the gap steadily became narrower. The words "cleavage", V-neck" and a complicated one she needed a while to comprehend � "d�collet�", she thought after a while � came to her mind. Despite the other words that still hung in her head without a real meaning she understood they described the gap between her breasts and the part of them that could be seen by others. From her thoughts she was thrown back into reality by a weird unpleasant sound coming from her dress. "Rip", it struck her. "Rip", "tear", "breaking apart" � her dress was ripping. Staring downwards she saw the top of her pyjama tearing under the pressure of her breasts. The tip of her cleavage wandered a centimeter deeper, turning from a curved line into a jagged wedge. The fine tooth-like frills on the sides of the tear stroke slightly over the skin of her swelling breasts as the fabric was pulled over them. Her chest continued to rip her dress apart while pushing it lower, Ailin watching as her d�collet� � now that she knew what the word meant she found it kind of funny � got bit by bit deeper. Every millimeter the fabric ripped she felt the fabric gliding over the curves of her bosom, widening in little steps the amount of skin that was shown.   
  
Hearing her dress tear over her protruding chest made the young girl even more nervous. It was just a small breeze though in the storm of thoughts that was raging through her head: Stiff from the growth sensations she helplessly watched her body becoming bigger, pressing against the floor and her dress. Her underpants were lying in a triangle form over her butt, uncovering the lower thirds of its cheeks while lying tightly over (most of) her butt gap. Through the tight skirt and panties one could clearly see the firm shape of her bubble bum, which as she looked at it hadn't quite become as large as she thought, her hips being only slightly wider than in the beginning. Still, the way it stuck out behind from her, with its round shape and the firmness of her flesh made it quite an attracting sight on the young girl, just like the pair of similarly attracting thighs below and the slim waist that was hugged by a form-fitting dress above her skirt. Looking down on her bosom she saw it getting steadily revealed while getting steadily more to be revealed. She put her hands on the sides of them, but instead of placing them on their flanks she stuck out her hands straight from her body. In relation to them her bosom reached out as much from her until the beginning of her fingers, bit by bit moving further despite her hands growing as well. She felt the flesh slightly pressing against her palms as it vaulted, the widest parts of her breasts moving out from her body. Removing her hands from her chest she then could feel her cheeks were getting a bit warmer. She couldn't see it, but her face that looked a lot more mature was gaining a slight blush, the skin of her cheeks changing slightly into the pink. Ailin shook her head, trying to shake off the feeling. She put her hands back on her head, pressing them against her ears. It wasn't just because of the feeling in her cheeks: More and more words had kept popping up as she continued to grow, the flood of information distracting her a little from the concern of the growth itself as she tried to keep track. It wasn't nearly as much as when she had been born, maybe a dozen words. What puzzled her was that like the "dirty" words the clear definition of them stayed a mystery to her. Sexy, hot, bootyliscious, curvaceous � Ailin shook her head as the words overwhelmed her, the whole situation being too much for the little girl.   
  
The term "little girl" though was becoming rather inappropriate to describe her: Ailin looked almost ten years older from before a minute ago. She had grown nearly tall enough to look her mother into the eyes, at least reaching up to her nose. In her appearance she also resembled her in pretty much every possible way: Her hair was roughly at the same length and of the same volume, falling in full black waves down to her shoulders. The expression on their faces was very similar, except Ailin lacked the slight signs of age that were showing in her mother's face. Her hands were as delicate and fine as hers, her legs as long and smooth as hers, her thighs had the same subtly thick appeal, and her butt was firm and full, but not fat, complimented by matching hips and a rather slender waist. Her breasts, having been non-existent a few moments ago were standing out proudly from her body, still swelling out from her. They had grown to a size Ailin compared to some fruits she and Mi had eaten earlier � grapefruits, if she remembered correctly. As her dress had torn down half her bosom she felt the feeling of growth slowly decreasing. No muscle moved inside her. Ailin sat quietly on the floor as her growth came to an end, her arms and legs growing a little bit further, her curves gaining a bit more bulk, her height increasing by few millimeters. It all was becoming less and less noticeable, both visibly and in feeling. After a while Ailin couldn't feel any more parts of her body growing, extending, expanding or swelling, even her chest and butt settling at their size.  
  
Once she was sure it was over Ailin felt a huge relief in her swollen chest. However, she was still confused, and on top of that very startled. Nervously she looked at her hands, seeing the chubby little fingers had become long and filigree, then up her arms that were almost completely bare, save for the small parts around her shoulders the sleeves had glided up to. Looking straight down she was greeted by the sight of her generous d�collet� hugging her pyjama, and looking down her back saw her butt pressing against her skirt, its hem lying just below it. That way everything of her meaty thighs was uncovered as well as the rest of her legs that were still kneeling on the ground. If she stood up one could have seen their skin shining in the moonlight that streamed through the window, Ailin sporting a pair of beautiful long legs ending in cute little feet that had only grown slightly during the process, but enough they didn't look awkward on her taller body. While her limbs, neck and a considerable part of her chest every part of her body still covered by her pyjama felt compressed and constricted, the fabric lying skin-tight on her waist, belly and back. Still in disbelief she put her hands on her face, sensing every contour that had changed, and then on top of her much more voluminous hair. Aside from the words she still searched meaning for Ailin only pondered about what had just happened to her, and if it was supposed to happen. But there were no memories about this being normal. Nothing in her mind told her that her mother had once grown like this as well. No, something deep inside told her this had to do with her being an� an� an artificial child. Yes, she thought, that was what she was: Artificial. Created. Not natural. She felt a heavy feeling in her chest, as if her pyjama was suddenly pulled even tighter around it. Without even thinking about it she knew what it was: Sadness. She was feeling sad.  
  
"Oh my god!"  
  
The eighteen-year old girl looked over to the door, seeing her mother standing in it. No jewellery or make-up decorated her anymore, and her hair wasn't as clean as in the morning either, looking a bit messy. Like she and her sister she was wearing a baby pink night dress, except the skirt was shorter in relation, similar to how hers looked after growing, and the dress had a deep cut over chest that generously exposed her firm breasts like the one in Ailin's pyjama, only the edges were smooth and not ripped up. Aside from the cleaner cut in the dress the two of them were almost like mirror images, only a few things separating them from each other. Her mother was probably an inch taller and generally a bit fuller on all parts of her body, and the features of her face were more adult. Despite the darkness in the room Ailin could see the shocked expression it was making.  
  
Immediately she ran over to Ailin. Before the girl could even say a word her face was already inside her mother's cleavage as she tightly embraced her daughter. "I� I must have messed up on the perimeters for age� put in too much hormones�", Ailin could hear her mother murmur. "I should have let the other's in the lab check my data� I shouldn't have done it alone� I'm sorry." After hugging her for a while her mother released her grip. Taking her by the shoulders she pushed Ailin out of her bosom, looking her straight into the face. "Your memories", she said "Did any more memories flow into your mind?"  
  
Ailin shook her head. "N-no", she stuttered, swallowed, then quickly added: "I mean, not much. Just a few, but� I don't really understand them�"  
  
Her mother sighed. "So it looks like it's just physically", she murmured. Held by her mother Ailin was shaking slightly, still overwhelmed with everything. Unable to control it she began to sob. Gently her mother embraced her again, this time hugging her in a way that her cleavage pressed again Ailin's neck. "Shh, it's okay", the young girl could hear her mother's soft, comforting voice say, and felt her hand stroking over her hair. "There's no need to be scared. Mommy's here now."  
  
Ailin gulped a few more times, holding back some tears. "Mommy� what� what will you do with me now?", she asked, her voice quivering between sobs. "I mean� I'm your experiment, and this wasn't supposed to happen." She swallowed again, her body shaking even heavier. "W-will you dispose of me now? Y- you wanted an eight-year old girl, and I'm not eight years old anymore, and-"  
  
Before she could speak any further her mother put a hand over Ailin's mouth. The teenager could then feel her lips on her forehead as she gave her a soft kiss. "You aren't my experiment, silly." She took her daughter's chin, raising her head so she was looking her into the eyes. There was still a spark of worry in her face, but it also showed a wonderful smile again. "You are my beloved daughter. I gave birth to you so Mi wouldn't be alone anymore. It doesn't matter how old you are. I'd still love you when you had turned ninety years old. And I definitely won't replace you." Once more she put her arms around her daughter, pressing her against her body. As her head was placed on her mother's shoulder Ailin could feel their bosoms squeezing together, the fabric of their clothes getting cramped between them. It created a comfortable warmth for Ailin, both literally and metaphorically. The warmth then rose a bit as someone else pushed her head into the sides of their bosoms while wrapping her tiny arms around the two. Over their breasts Mi looked up at her suddenly much bigger sister, smiling at her as if nothing had happened.  
  
"That's right, Ai!", the little girl chirped. "You're my sister! I don't care if you're bigger than me � it'll only make you easier to find in hide-and-seek." Leaning a little towards Ailin she whispered: "But I'm still the big sister, 'kay?"  
  
Ailin remained silent for a while. Her mother stroked her hair while Mi cuddled their bosoms, Ailin feeling as she rubbed her cheek over her breast. She then leaned a little forward, pressing her own face a little against the top of her mother's chest. "What will we do now?", she asked quietly.  
  
Her mother put one of her arms around Mi, smiling even brighter. "Whatever we'll do, we'll do it together", she said while closely hugging her two daughters. "As a family."  
  
In that moment, as she felt the warmth of her sister's and mother's bodies and words, Ailin finally understood what "love" meant.

[A special family](./I3reacl_files/A special family by ~I3reacl on deviantART.htm)by ~[I3reacl](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/)

An age progression story about the newest member of a quite special family.  
  
The idea for this story was originally a suggestion from [![:icondanio13:](./I3reacl_files/danio13.gif "danio13")](http://danio13.deviantart.com/) back in February 2011, one of the first story suggestions I got. I liked the idea a lot and wanted to make a story out of it, but I always ended up pushing it back in favour of other projects. I�m really glad I could finally give myself an excuse to write it in the form of the little �poll� I made about which of my stories should get a sequel([[link]](http://i3reacl.deviantart.com/journal/Poll-results-286371559)). It�s not really a sequel to �A special treat�, but it�s a continuation of the �Special series�, which can count as well as a sequel I think ![;P](./I3reacl_files/winkrazz.gif "Wink/Razz")  
  
It was really fun writing this, even a bit refreshing. I actually don�t like BE stories that are too emotional, I�m more a fan of simple and light-hearted stuff, but writing something more character-driven once in a while helps clear the mind a little. Sadly the growth isn�t as descriptive as it could be, which is partly due to DA�s size limit again, but also out of laziness from me. I hope you�ll still enjoy it ![:)](./I3reacl_files/smile.gif ":) (Smile)")  
  
(By the way this is the last of the sequels. For the rest of the year, I think I�m gonna write some short stories that I�ve had on my list for a long time.)  
  
(Another note for those who want to suggest a story to me or have suggested one: In the past three and a half years I received roughly a dozen suggestions. This is the first time I have actually turned one of those ideas into a story, and it took more than one and a half year until I started working on it. So don�t get your hope up too much if I say to your suggestion �I might do it� ![^^;](./I3reacl_files/animesweat.gif "Sweating a little..."))

I really like this. I came looking around the BE stuff, and I skimmed over this, but then I came back and read it in it's entirety, and I really enjoyed it.

Ever since I saw that request, I was waiting for this to be made. And now? I'm so darn giddy Iit's contagious. ^^ You did an excellent job with making this- I especially like how Mi reacted to Ai's growth spurt, nonchalantly noting that she's still the oldest. XD  
  
Also, did you use names that sounded like "I" and "Me" on purpose? Because that's awesome. And fitting! ![:D](./I3reacl_files/biggrin.gif ":D (Big Grin)")

I'm glad you like it ^-^ I'm afraid though my good friend coincidence helped me again with the names(didn't notice they sounded like "Me" and "I" XD)

Well, Mi is a letter off from Mii, so I figured they were pronounced similarly. And AiAi is prounounced Aye-aye, so that came up too. XD I'm actually surprised you didn't notice until now, but then again that happens often. XD

I didn't really put much thought into the names. I searched a site for Thai names and found they sounded nice^^

Quality as usual. I quite like how this one was more character-driven.  
  
  
...don't take the fact that I had little to say the wrong way; it was really good, probably one of my favorites of yours.

I quite enjoyed this story. I really like that you adressed the character's emotions and fear as she grew older unexpectedly, rather than have her go 'This is awesome! as many other, less character driven stories would have done. And the ending was quite touching. Superb stuff all around.

**One Sip**Since that night, I have believed in love at first song.  
  
You sang.  
  
Darling, you stirred your voice into the coffeehouse scents;  
It carried notes of inspiration and the flavor of your soul.  
  
You smiled.  
  
Your words trickled down my throat, and I savored their warmth.   
There was no bitterness, no dregs- just your heart poured out.  
  
You stood.

 | Deviousness

[:iconfaestock:](http://faestock.deviantart.com/) `[faestock](http://faestock.deviantart.com/) is one of our best known and popular deviants from the Stock and Resources community. Her gallery is filled to the brim with high quality stock photographs that have inspired deviants to get creative, and turn the already beautiful images into something magical. Jessica always takes time to reach out to deviants, providing contests and nurturing other artists. We're inspired by her selfless attitude and dedication to a genre that we couldn't create without. It's with great pleasure that we award the Deviousness Award for September 2013 to `[faestock](http://faestock.deviantart.com/), congratulations.  [Read More](http://today.deviantart.com/)
