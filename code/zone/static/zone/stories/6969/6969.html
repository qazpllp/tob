<p>Unknown Worlds 2 : Cruise</p>
<p>An expansion short story by . Thi is for adults only, So you knowif you should be reading this. </p>
<pre><code> Chet was in a bad place when he won that sweepstake. A letter had arrived the day before yesterday, and it was very great news. He had just quit his job because he just couldn't see the point anymore.

 But the day after he had quit his job, he received a notice that he was a winner of a free cruise. He would have thrown it away as junk mail, but it had been handwritten on parchment with a red wax seal. He was to meet the boat in the morning, and he would be away for the week. He could use the time relaxing to update his resume and do some s soul searching.

  Chet was so in his own head that he didn't notice the boat until he was right Next to it. The Virgin was a cruise ship, but it displayed the style of Roaring Twenties. The ship's colors gave it an ancient patina, brass rails, and wooden planks lined the walkways. Broad paths made walking the boat look easy. But everyone working on the ship were dressed in their modern finest.

 The short woman at the front was dressed in black slacks, a violet dress shirt, and an orange cream vest. Her outfit our him in mind of a sunset. And her breasts were jammed into that vest and were putting a fair amount of pressure on the buttons. They pressed together to show a fair amount of cleavage with her few top buttons undone. They pulled his eyes into their depths.

  "I said, do you have your invitation?" She said.

 "I'm sorry, what?" Chet replied.

 "I asked for your invitation." She repeated.

 "Oh my god. I am so sorry. I don't know what came over me." Chet was feeling very self-conscious right about now.

 He had used to be a reasonably active member of his gym. Still, since starting his old job, he didn't have the energy after work to exercise anymore. He felt every extra pound he has gained over three years. It was a wall, just another shot to his self-confidence. He pulled up straight and tried to suck his gut in as discretely as he could and handed her the invitation.

 "Oh, don't worry about it. I get that a lot." She took his invitation and grabbed his hand. "I am going to tell you a secret, I kind of like the attention."

 Chet was taken aback by the contact. Chet hadn't interacted with women for a few years since he and his girlfriend broke up. He didn't have much in the way of love during that time. Or even talking to women. This sudden immersion into the deep end was going to be rough during the trip.

 She took the invitation and brought it under a lamp that revealed a strange symbol watermarked onto the paper. A diamond shape with several curved lines spiraling into the center rested behind the text of the letter.

 "Looks like you will be in Room 17 and that will be on the port side first level. If you need to find another room, it goes up by tens on each floor, and even numbers on the starboard side, odd numbers on the port, and numbers start at the bow. And if you need anything, dial 0 on the phone in your room, and ask for me, Julia." She drew attention tho her chest one again, and Chet saw that her name tag was sitting precariously, almost falling into her cleavage.

 "Okay, will do." Chet now saw that she had a light red tie tucked into her cleavage, eclipsed by the orbs below it.

When Chet got to the top of the loading ramp, he looked a back to see that Julia had been watching him walk it. She waved to Chet with a small flirty flip of her hands, and he waved back.

There were more people here than he was expecting. Couples and solo people walking the decks, and more staff then he would think would be needed for a boat this size. He had some trouble getting by everyone else and was noticing the employees were all extremely attractive.

But he soon arrived in his room. When he opened the door, he was expecting to see something the size of a dorm room, but this was almost a full suite. He slammed his stuff down on the king-size bed and pulled out his laptop. He glanced around the room. There were a few lamps with almost a stained glass look to them. He placed the laptop on the desk and started plugging in power. He scanned around for a note with the WiFi password or setup instructions.

He found nothing.

Chet picked up the phone and dialed zero. A thick, accented male voice answers. "Room service. How may I assist you?"

"I am looking for some way to connect to the WiFi."

"Oh, I am so sorry. We do not have wireless internet, the only way you can access the internet is from your dest. Merely place your computer on the desk, and you will be able to connect."

Chet was confused. He had never heard about tech like this. He tried to keep ahead of the latest developments and didn't know what he was talking about.

"How does that work?"

"It's a finely directed unsecured WiFi signal range only right above the desk. It's open, so your devices should just connect. The management doesn't want wireless devices to get in the way of people's enjoyment of the outdoors. "

"Okay, then." Chet was unsure of this explanation.

"Did you find the bottle acceptable?"

"What bottle?"

"The bottle of libations on the bed? It looks like we have you down for a bottle of tequila. Was it not there?"

"No, I don't see anything. "

  "I am so sorry, sir, there was supposed to be a gift for you on your bed when you arrived. I will be sending someone by with your gift. Did anyone greet you on your way to your room?"

"Julia met me at the front dock."

"Oh! She is just finishing the last check-ins. I am sure she would love to bring that by your room."

 "Uh, okay." Chet was already getting nervous about Julia. He had messed it up with her already, and he was worried about being near her again. Chet figured that a little work would take his mind off of things. He opened his laptop, and it connected to the desk. The connection just said 'DESK' as the connection name. He lifted up the computer. It instantly disconnected when no longer touching the surface.

 The laptop was also charging when he placed it back down. Weird,

 There was a knock on the door.

Chet opened the door, and Julia was there, A bottle of tequila in one hand, and the other was just popping another button of her shirt open. There was a wave that jiggled across her chest as her breast settled. Her blouse was undone all the way down to her vest. Now there was an even better view of the soft-looking bounty.

There was an awkward pause as Chet watched this, and she watched him watch her.

"I was just making myself more comfortable. You don't know how good that feels." She said as she walked past him into his room.

Chet turned around to follow her. The door slowly swung closed on its own.

Julia had hopped up on the massive bed and was placing the bottle between the pillows. She was on all fours crawling across the bed. Her tight little peach-shaped ass flexed and bounced with each movement.

It was too much, he was going to need a cold shower after this.

 "Oh, I should have offered you a drink," Julia said, turning around. She smirked and wiggled her ass a little.

  "Caught you staring again."

Chet stared up into her face as she had turned back to look at him.

 "Do you like what you see?"

For a second, Chet was taken aback. He wasn't sure what she had just said. She couldn't be hitting on him, could she?

 "Oh, I see." She said. She flopped around on the bed and darted across the sheets with her legs spread wide, causing even more tantalizing jiggles.

Chet was rock hard at this point.

 When she got to the edge of the bed, she said,

"Come here, Chet."

He walked to her.

"I think you might be confused." She reached out and started to lightly brush her fingers across his dick, straining down one of the pant legs of his trousers.

"You may think, 'She is way out of my league, and this can't be happening.' But something you may not understand is that I have a type. And you fill that type for me, Chet. So what do you say Chet, do you want to fill me?" Julia said, and grabbed his cock firmly through his pants and started to rub up and down the shaft.

Chet reached down and placed his hand underneath one of her breasts, and massaged upwards. With a palmful of her tit, he leaned in and kissed her deeply. Julia moaned through his kiss and bit down on his lower lip.

She used her hands to work off his belt and furiously dug at his button and zipper of his jeans. When they released, she pulled them down as far as she could. But she stopped when his cock popped up at her, She gazed up into Chet's eyes and saw his pleading look. She took hold of his rod and gently licked the underside of the tip.

The sudden flood of sensation made his knees buckle.

"I like the way you react to me, Chet," Julia said. She took his cock in his mouth and started to work it back and forth.

Chet wasn't going to last long. She was so good at this, he only wished that he could last longer and savor the sensation.

"Julia, I don't think.." and Julia swirled her tongue around him in her mouth. "I am not going to last..."

And Julie went harder. She reached around and cupped his ass-cheeks with both hands and deep-throated him. She pulled harder when moved back, and teased him on the way back in.

Chet erupted into her mouth.

But Julia didn't stop. She sucked harder and plunged in again and again. The waves from his dick washed over Chet, and just kept cumming. He lost his balance. Dropping to his knees, Chet slipped out of her mouth and ended up kneeling in front of her.

 "Think you have a few more of those in you?" As she unbuttoned her vest, she wiped the corner of her mouth.

Chet had never felt more energized in his life. He could go for another seven, no eight.

"Yeah, I can."

"Then let's do this right." Julia reached back for the bottle of tequila and finished unbuttoning her clothes. Her shirt and vest were hanging loose, while her suspenders were bent outwards by her breasts. Her tits were held up with an industrial pink bra, and they were pushing up out of the tops. He started to reach for her, but she stopped him.

 "Pay me back first." She said, taking a sip of the tequila. Julia brought his chin up and kissed him fuller than he had ever kissed before. When her tongue dipped into his mouth, he could taste the tequila.

 Chet nodded and slipped his left hand down the back of her pants and unbuttoned the pants at the same time. When they were undone, he moved his left hand down to dig his fingers into her ass. Julia gasped. He could smell her lavender perfume as he kissed the underside of her breast.

He used his right had to pull down her pants and black panties at the same time. He kissed her belly and kissed her inner thighs as well. This placed his face right into her crotch.

Chet had never felt confident going down on his old girlfriends, and often it didn't result in anything, but Julia reacted encouragingly. She sighed, fell back onto the bed, and started to run her hands through his hair.

Julia's head was back against the bed, and her back was a little arched. Her breast blocked his view of her face entirely, but he could hear soft moans coming from beyond them.

His old partners had never shown as much enthusiasm as Julia. It was so encouraging to hear. He dove deeper and more energetically. Swirling his tongue and occasionally pressing his finger in between her slit. Each time she moaned, he would back off for a second and then pushes into her further.

 Too soon, she tensed up and squeezed Chet's hair with her hands and his head with her thighs.

He continued.

 "Stop. Stop." She whispered, "I need you inside me now."

 Chet got up. Julia must have dislodged her bra out of place because it was digging even farther into her tits. It was so hot to Chet. It looked like her tits were going to grow right out of her bra.

She tried to reach behind her to unhook the bra, but it was under too much pressure. She rolled over to her stomach.

"Help me with this bra."

Chet reached down to see the hooks of her bra were starting to pull apart.

"It looks like this one is just about to give up."

"Yeah, I got a little carried away before I could take care of it."

Chet popped the hooks open, and he could see where it dug into her back.

He leaned down to massage the area a little bit.

Julia moaned and pushed her ass into Chet. He started to adjust himself, so his dick laid in-between her ass cheeks. Her ass was softer and more massive than when she was wearing pants.

"You must have packed yourself into those," Chet said, He straddled her ass and started to rub her back and rub into her ass at the same time.

"It's better on some days than it is on others, but they are worth it. " Chet thought about her ass, but he got the feeling that she's was talking about her other curves.

"Let me see."

Chet lifted up a bit, and Julia spun around underneath him. Her tits fell to either side of her chest. Chet moved forward and grabbed both breasts and took one of her nipples into his mouth. It was already stiff, but after he started playing with it, it grew harder and puffed up even more.

Julia moaned softly.

"I want you inside of me, Now. "

 Chet moved his hips back and dropped down. He was so hard, and she was so wet that he slowly slid into her full depths. He could see her eyes roll back into her head as she breathed out a silent scream.

 He thrust slowly and hard. When he pulled out, he moved even slower and went back with a moan. Now Chet was the one moaning out loud.

With each hard thrust, her beasts seamed larger. It was just Chet's imagination, but they would bounce in a circle and fall back into place only slightly larger. It was like with each push, he was inflating her.

 So he thrust harder.

 "You are so strong." She was tightening up around him. Julia pulled herself up and whispered into his ear, "Show me how strong you are."

 Chet still had most of his muscles, and they showed in his arms and shoulders, but most of the rest were covered in a layer of fat. She was small, and he thought he could show her a thing for a bit.

 He moved her hands over to his neck and grabbed her ass. His fingers pressed further into it than before.
</code></pre>
<p>And without even pulling out, Chet rocked Julia up out of bed and lifted her. </p>
<p>She was more substantial than she looked, but Chet had little problem getting her off the bed. He never even pulled out. Chet lifted her up and kept fucking her. He would use his strong arms to lift Julia up and down on his cock. She pressed into his chest, wrapped her legs around his waist, and dug her hands into his neck. Julia gasped with each thrust, but then she put her mouth on Chet's shoulder, got and screamed into his muscles.</p>
<pre><code> Julia got wetter and wetter as he showed off for her. He could feel it starting to spill onto his balls now.

 Unfortunately, Che was going to get tired quickly doing this. He learned her up against the wall and continued thrusting.

 He could feel her grow tighter with a better angle, and when he thrust, he could feel the pressure on the underside of his dick. Her pussy was pulling him in and trying to not let him go.

Chet could feel her breast growing now. He didn't believe what he was feeling, but they were growing faster now. He could feel her ass swell beneath his hands.

 But then Julia came, and her pussy squeezed him harder. Juices ran down Chet's legs, and as she twitched in his arms, Chet came again. Their juices mixed and ran to the floor. It felt like he was erupting for hours inside of her.

Chet was starting to shake, and Julia let go of his neck, pushing back against the wall.

Chet started to stagger backward under her increasing weight and flopped back onto the bed. His dick still buried inside of her.

"I am not done with you yet." She lifted up her back and started to ride Chet,

He could see her breasts clearly now. They were much, much larger than when he had seen her this morning. Her ass, while tight, used to be on the small firm side, but now he could see the hourglass shape she was forming.

 He wasn't going to last long like this. He never knew that he was into Julie growing like this, but he was so turned on.

He came again. This time there was a noticeable surge from Julie's breasts. They plumped up, gaining girth while Chet stared. She rolled forward, and her eyes went back up into her head again, and Julia came again.

Julia collapsed onto Chet.

They both stayed there a while, and everyone once and a while, one of their still engaged organs would twitch, reminding them that they were still inside one another.

 "What is going on here?" Chet asked.

"What?" Julia replied.

"You tits, you ass they grew."

"No, I think I would have noticed," Julia said. She pressed her massive breast together in Chet's face.

"I can see that they are bigger. It's not a little bit. Your breasts were massive before, but you must almost be twice as big. The same with your ass."

"Don't be silly, if that was true, could I do this?" And Julia reached down to pick her panties out of her pants and put them back on. Her panties used to have a cute pattern on the ass, in the shape of a heart. Her cheeks were so massive, they now pushed and pulled to reshape her panties into a thong.

"Look, I have to get back to work, but can I come by later tonight?"

For a second, Chet forgot about her growing assets.

"You want to see me again?"

Julia laughed.

"I don't know know what your home life regularly looks like, but that was some of the best sex I've ever had." She leaned in and kissed him on the cheek.
</code></pre>
<p>"And I would sleep better at sea if you fucked my brains out again tonight." She whispered into his ear. </p>
<pre><code>Chet blushed.

"Oh, dammit. You are just so cute." Julia kissed him deeply this time.

She had placed her bra back on and started to pull on her pants. She noticed Chet looking again and threw in some extra waggle to show off.

Chet was almost hard again from watching her ass and tits shake.

"Ooo. Looks like I can get another one out of you."

Julia took his legs in her arms and spun him into position. She placed him in-between her massive its and started to work him.

Chet was lost. She worked the pressure of her breasts expertly and would lick his dick when it poked out from between her canyons.

It wasn't long before his body clenched again, and she drove down hard to get his dick into her mouth. He shook. The orgasm wracked his whole body.

Julia stood up and buttoned her shirt and vest back up. They fit almost perfectly, even with the new size, and her clothes pressed her tits into new frontiers of cleavage for Chet.

"I'll be back for more tonight. Believe it." Julia said sternly. Chet could almost see the other things she said as jokes, but this was serious and purposeful.

Julia left.

Her scent still lingered in his room. Chet couldn't help but feel abandoned and drained after she left. His old relationships had lots of after-sex cuddling, and he was missing it right now. His afterglow was slowly turning to a drained feeling.

Chet got up, grabbed the bottle of tequila, and walked into the bathroom. When he stood in front of the toilet, he was shocked again.

His dick was almost two inches longer and had way more girth than before.

 He took a long swing of the tequila.

He had just had some crazy sex, and not only did he imagine a woman growing on top of him. Now he was seeing changes in his own body. He was either going mad, or he was already inside tonight's dream. He reached down to feel his dick. A shot if arousal ran up his nerves. This felt more real than most of the last few years.

Looks like Julia wasn't the only one changing.

Chet reached over and started the shower and set it just above freezing. He took a swig from the bottle of tequila.

<p>Epilogue</p>
<pre><code>"Hey, Have you seen Julia?"

 A thin woman with short blond hair walked down the side of the ship. She was talking to a tall man with dark hair.

"I sent her down to a Prospects room to deliver some drinks."

"Goddammit, Raphael. She is going to scare him off. You know I have to delay her before she gets a hold of the prospects. They all leave before we depart, and no one else gets to have any fun. I put her on ticket duty so she would be busy all day."

"Oh, what is the harm. If the Prospects leave, then they were never meant to leave with us." Raphael said.

"We can't just..." she started.

"But maybe its because you are jealous?" Raphael said. "Don't you two usually have a romp or two on the night before we depart?"

The small woman lit up with fury.

"You know its not like that. We just get along. We get along until..."

"Yeah, sure. Until what? Until hell freezes over? You two tried to make it work, but It never does. You two go off and fight and fuck and fight again, I am tired of your two's bullshit. I always get dragged into it. You should listen to your dad and move on. Ki"
</code></pre>
<p>"Oh, yeah, well, " the small woman said. She was hurt by the reminder of how those moments felt.</p>
<pre><code>"She is going to be running through the drinks checklist before we leave, so she should be down there checking to see if we have what we need."
</code></pre>
<p>"We always have what we need. Why should this time be any different."</p>
<pre><code>"Elise, You know why we check. It's our job. No one else on this boat gets a free pass by being the Captain's daughter. "

“Well, fuck you, too."

"And a Merry Fuck you, as well.”

Raphael politely bowed as Elise walked away.
