<p>A Christmas Story </p>
<p>​
​
 </p>
<p>2 </p>
<p>“Hoooooly craaaaap! 
It was finally here. After several weeks of the tease that is Thanksgiving, I was </p>
<p>” 
What a DAAAAAY!!
​</p>
<p>finally </p>
<p>heading into my Christmas break. Mind you, I wasn’t just sauntering into these glorious days off; 
I was jumping headfirst with each and every day’s pajama plans already solidified in my mind. 
There were an entire two weeks of no work to look forward to. No paperwork, no 
unnecessary meetings, no Dan from accounting. Damn you, Dan From Accounting… This truly 
was the most wonderful time of the year and I intended to make every second of my vacation 
count, starting now and running through New Year’s Day. If only there was snow on the ground 
instead of these puddles. </p>
<p>I didn’t even bother cleaning out my work bag. It would still be there when January came </p>
<p>around, right? Why worry about it now. The only things I needed to concern myself with were 
the couch, my butt, and a cheesy holiday romance. All in good time, but first I needed to get out 
of these work clothes. </p>
<p>Stripping naked and tossing every garment into a pile, I dug into my dresser drawer and </p>
<p>pulled out the outfit I would be living in for the majority of the next two weeks. A soft, cotton 
pajama set warmed my hands. The front of the button-up shirt displayed my name in dancing 
embroidery. </p>
<p>Dawn </p>
<p>It was a Christmas tradition. Every Thanksgiving after our family meal, my mother, bless </p>
<p>her heart, would give each of her kids a new set of pajamas embroidered with our names. Then 
we would have to suffer through the excitement until we were 
once school paused for break. </p>
<p>allowed to wear them 
actually
​</p>
<p>A new pair of pajamas was a lot more useful back then when we were outgrowing last 
year’s. I’m twenty-seven now, though. I’m not outgrowing my pajamas any time soon but they 
keep coming like clockwork every year. I think Mom is just trying to keep some of that old 
Christmas spirit alive. It’s such an easy thing to lose as you get older. Needless to say, I pretty 
much have an entire bin dedicated to my treasured pajamas. </p>
<p>This year’s were a dark, royal red with gold lines along the seams. Compared to my </p>
<p>apartment, they felt far too extravagant for my blood. But they were made with a mother’s love 
and that warmth never failed to hit me as soon as I ceremoniously pulled the pants over my legs 
and clasped the shirt’s buttons. That’s right; no bra 
relaxation thing. </p>
<p>underwear. I’m serious about this 
or
​</p>
<p>The reflection in the mirror was satisfying. I looked ready for eggnog and a nap. </p>
<p>Somehow Mom always knew my size. The pajamas belonged on my slender frame and for a 
second I felt like a magazine model. Like a dark-haired Rachel McAdams getting ready for bed. 
Had my boyfriend been there, I don’t think I would be staying in these for very long. Pulling at </p>

<p>3 </p>
<p>the fabric going across my bust, I found a fair amount of excess space. Far more than my A-cups 
required. </p>
<p>I couldn’t help but giggle. “You know me too well, Mom…” She </p>
<p>forgot to account 
never
​</p>
<p>for an extra-loose fit in the bust of my shirt. </p>
<p>The couch caught me like a long-lost lover and a sigh akin to a mountain settling deflated </p>
<p>my chest. I had the perfect Christmas movie in mind to start off my break. All I had to do was 
turn on the TV and-- </p>
<p>There was something next to the TV remote. Something </p>
<p>more stress-relieving than 
far
​</p>
<p>. The butterflies in my belly made me bite my lip with temptation. 
The Santa Clause
​</p>
<p>It was my trusty Boosti-Breast, a well-used temporary growth device. Sorry, a </p>
<p>very </p>
<p>well-used temporary growth device. </p>
<p>Don’t give me that look! It’s more uncommon for a girl </p>
<p>to have one these days! 
not 
​
When these magical pieces of invention came out years ago, the implant industry collapsed 
overnight. To a young Dawn going through puberty, getting my hands on one was all I wanted. 
Along with every other girl in my class. By law you couldn’t have one before you were eighteen,

<p>I got Ol’ Faithful the day I crossed that age limit. Took a year of financial planning in </p>
<p>order for me to afford it. By that time they were fairly commonplace but still somewhat of a 
luxury item. She got me through some of my best years in college… Some of my best dates, too. 
Almost ten years later, she was still holding strong. As strong as the duct tape wrapped around 
her, at least. </p>
<p>I should explain. My Boosti-Breast isn’t the most powerful female enhancement device </p>
<p>on the market. It wasn’t when I bought it, and it certainly wasn’t now. Hell, it wouldn’t have 
even broken the top five in the industry ten years ago! But it was what I could afford and it got 
the job done. I was hooked on it from the first use. </p>
<p>It was about a foot long with big rounded bulges and a dial or two. Similar to what you </p>
<p>would see in an old sci-fi film or something Marvin the Martian might point at Bugs Bunny. 
Mine was dull blue with green accents, but a lot of the paint was worn off through the years. The 
trigger had been hot glued more times than I could count and more often than not it had a faint 
burning smell after I used it. That scent had actually come to be a bit of a turn on for me... A strip 
of duct tape wrapped around its oval muzzle to prevent the spreading of a devious crack from an 
especially drunken night during senior year of college. Don’t ask. </p>
<p>Ol’ Faithful didn’t have much power behind her. The dial labeled ‘Size’ near the handle 
was turned to the highest setting as always. I put it there the minute I unwrapped it. The rest of 
the labels were long gone from wear and tear. Honestly I’m not even sure I 
I wanted to. It was probably stuck. </p>
<p>turn the dial if 
could

<p>Don’t go getting too excited now. Maximum power is a relative term. Even at full blast I </p>
<p>couldn’t increase my cup size to anything substantial. If it was a good day and the electronic 
gods were willing, I could manage to get myself into the realm of say...volleyballs? </p>

decision-making skills on whether to start my vacation off with a movie or some relaxing

<p>The handle was cold in my hands. “Make it a good one,” I whispered to the booster, </p>

<p>My pajama top popped open like a party favor. No longer constrained, I watched my </p>
<p>temporarily-engorged breasts rise into the air as full, supple mounds the size of decent 
cantaloupes. A slight breeze across my thimble nipples was enough to make me pant. </p>
<p>Technology is amazing, isn’t it? I was considered flat-chested no more than a minute ago. </p>
<p>Now I’m staring at a literal pair of fleshy melons filling the space between my biceps. </p>
<p>I was right to turn the TV on. I couldn’t wait any longer and attacked myself. A generous </p>
<p>amount of time was spent massaging my new assets. I’ve never gotten over feeling my fingers 
sink into my own skin like a pillow. I honestly don’t know how busty girls don’t play with 
themselves all day.  </p>
<p>After a point, I couldn’t handle the massage any longer. I needed more. The heat between </p>
<p>my thighs was far too intense to ignore. Keeping one hand working overtime on my chest to 
knead and occasionally bring a needy nipple to my lips, my other hand slipped under my bottoms 
into what felt like a sauna. 
“
” Yea, definitely a good idea to have the TV on.<br />
Mmnngh!!! OH!!
​
I started masturbating furiously. Not that I necessarily needed the help downstairs; nipple </p>
<p>orgasms were easy to come by when I was boosted. But the faster I enjoyed myself and my 
bloated knockers, the faster I could enjoy them in other ways, right? Hugging them while 
watching TV, walking around the apartment and feeling their weighty bounces, maybe pinching 
a nipple here and there to test the waters for another round on the couch…  </p>
<p>I’ll be the first to admit it; I get off on my tits. More than any other girl I knew. It’s not a </p>
<p>secret. They’re just enjoyable, all right?? Everything about them is sheer goodness! They’re so 
simple yet I’m never tired of them! The bigger they are, the more I, or a date, have to play with. </p>

” 
Hah… Mmmmm!! H-Haaah…
​
It was coming. The big reveal. The climax. The edge of the cliff. Just feeling how soft </p>
<p>they were...and full...and my skin squeezing between my fingers...these massive mounds jiggling 
and...wobbling in every direction on top of me...pressing into my arms and chin...blown up like 
balloons from such small beginnings...it just makes me want to...to… </p>
<p>“</p>
<p>” Muscles squeezed my working fingers to a trembling standstill 
NNGHHHH!!!!
​</p>
<p>between my thighs and I could feel my pulse beating inside my chest from orgasmic release. </p>
<p>God I needed that. 
I fell limp on the couch under heavy breath and an arm wrapped across my chest. I didn’t 
dare remove the fingers from my crotch; I needed a moment before I could deal with any kind of 
friction down there. </p>
<p>“</p>
<p>…” I shifted on the couch, going onto my side and clamping my thighs on my 
Mmmm
​</p>
<p>hand. A kiss planted itself in my cleavage. “Good to have you girls back.” I could enjoy them for 
a couple hours before the booster’s effects wore off and I had to watch them return to their 
natural state. Of course I could just give them another shot afterward, but part of enjoying 
yourself is also limiting yourself, right? Self-control is what gives special treats their sweetness. </p>
<p>​

<p>I sighed, enjoying feeling my breasts’ soft warmth enveloping my arm and torso while I 
sleepily watched whatever had been happening on TV. Some girls hug a pillow when they relax; 
I do too, it’s just self-heating and all-natural. </p>
<p>A high-end commercial faded onto the screen. Two women were putting their bikini tops </p>

<p>The night drew on. By the time I was heating up a bowl of mac and cheese for dinner, I </p>
<p>was also watching my chest shrink by the cup size as my booster’s effects wore off. The 
IncrediBust commercial hadn’t left my mind. I could never afford something so extravagant. I 
was not the target audience; rich men with hot wives were. </p>
<p>I watched my dinner spin and sighed, feeling the last of my boost shrink away. The image </p>
<p>of that sleek, powerful booster hadn’t left my mind for a second. If it wasn’t meant for me, why 
couldn’t I stop thinking about it? </p>

My girlfriends cheered my name when I walked into the bar. It wasn’t very hard to pick </p>
<p>them out over the festive crowd, but their boisterous greeting led me straight to their table. It was 
obvious they were a few drinks ahead of me. </p>
<p>“Here! We already ordered a drink for you!” one of them, Jasmine, offered. She was </p>
<p>extra energetic tonight. “Mojito, just how you like it!” </p>
<p>Kally chuckled and glanced at the cleavage I had pouring out of my little black dress. </p>
<p>“Might be a little watered down by now. Running a little late? Looks like you’re all done up for 
our girls’ night out; that dusty old booster of yours acting up again?” </p>
<p>I sighed and sat in the booth, taking a healthy drink of my mojito. “Like you wouldn’t </p>
<p>believe. I had to go one cup at a time or it would overheat! Poor thing is on its last legs…” </p>

<p>“Oh shut up!” I slapped my drunk friend away and she laughed. How obvious was it that </p>
<p>I was blushing? After all these years I still got flak for my booster-based fetish. </p>
<p>Jasmine pat Kally on the shoulder to help calm her down. “Stop teasing her! Some girls 
just like pumping themselves up! I’ve heard the noises Dawn makes when that booster hits her.

<p>She and Kally burst out laughing at my expense. I couldn’t very well deny any of it; it </p>
<p>was fairly common knowledge in my close circle of family and friends that I enjoyed my booster 
for my own personal reasons. </p>
<p>“I don’t think I’ve touched mine in months…!” Kally said after catching her breath. </p>
<p>“Might be about time to start bringing the girls out again, though.” </p>
<p>I was happy to turn the attention elsewhere. “Oooh, ready to start dating again, are we? 
Maybe I should have brought my booster with me! A full shirt might snag you a guy tonight.” </p>
<p>Kally stuck her tongue out in response. “I’m not </p>
<p>desperate yet, but there might come 
that 
​</p>
<p>a time soon enough. Seems like most guys only see you when you’re carting around a giant set 
of jugs these days. Especially when they just keep making boosters more powerful. They won’t 
even notice you if you’re not blown up like a sex balloon.” </p>

<p>Jasmine agreed. She wasn’t much larger than my normal A-cups, but she was far more </p>
<p>confident with them than I. “It’s not easy finding someone actually into small breasts anymore.” 
She sighed and looked at me. “You’re lucky you actually enjoy the whole booster thing.” </p>
<p>“You don’t?” I asked. 
“Well...I mean sure it </p>

​
minute! After that you’re stuck with a sore back and tight shoulders for the rest of the night! Not 
to mention just a giant pair of fleshy things getting in the way!” </p>
<p>Kally nodded, quickly swallowing her drink to add, “Yea! Sure, I might make myself big 
enough to get a guy’s number, but then I’m spending fifty bucks at the chiropractor the next day 
after they’ve gone down. I don’t know how you do it, Dawn. I’m a D-cup and I would trade for 
your size in a heartbeat if it didn’t mean I would be invisible.” She caught herself a moment later 
and added, “No offense…” </p>
<p>“None taken,” I waved. “Don’t really have any evidence otherwise. I can’t tell you the

Kally was staring again. “She likes being top-heavy, can’t blame her for that.” 
“Has Mason even seen you at your regular size? Like, he knows you’re not </p>
<p>actually </p>
<p>stacked, right?” </p>

<p>Somehow the conversation was focused on me again. “Yes, Kally, he knows I’m an </p>
<p>“Just checking! I can’t remember the last time I’ve seen you small…” She thought for a </p>
<p>moment before her eyes lit up. “There was that time at the pool when it wore off and your top

<p>saw them then!” 
Everyone
​</p>
<p>“Thank you for reminding me about that incredibly embarrassing moment in my life,” I </p>
<p>growled. It wasn’t my fault the duration hadn’t lasted as long as I set. I bet the IncrediBust 
wouldn’t have had that problem. </p>
<p>Jasmine tried to console me. “Don’t listen to her. No one remembers, Dawn.” 
I didn’t know if people not remembering my natural chest was a good thing or not. More 
than anything I just wanted to turn the conversation away from my sexual urges. “Any plans for 
Christmas?” </p>
<p>Both shook their heads. 
“I’ll be here! My parents thought a cruise would make a good couple’s gift, so unless I </p>
<p>want to spend Christmas with my aunt and her four cats, I’m staying here.” </p>
<p>“Just sticking around, I think. Money is tight so I can’t exactly fly across the country for </p>
<p>family,” Kally shrugged and finished her drink. “But if we’re all here… You know what that 
means?? </p>
<p>“Christmas at Dawn’s?” Jasmine gasped. 
“Christmas at Dawn’s!” 
This was news to me! “W-Wait, don’t I--” </p>

<p>“Nope!” Kally drunkenly leaned on me. I wasn’t much support, feeling the effects of my </p>
<p>own booze. One of her fingers sank into my bust as she poked me and said, “Too late! It’s 
planned now! We’ll be over first thing in the morning on Christmas!” </p>
<p>Jasmine was giddy. “If we didn’t already spend the night!” 
“Actually I think Mason and I were gonna--” 
“Oooohhh she wants to spend Christmas Eve with her special friend,” Kally teased. 
“Don’t worry, we’ll wear earplugs. I’m sure you’ve got a sexy little Santa costume all picked out 
and ready to be filled up for him!” </p>

<p>I knew my answer. I suspect you even know my answer. It popped into my head the </p>
<p>second Kally asked and ordered another drink. Blurting it out was obviously the worst thing I 
could have done after finally getting the focus away from my booster obsession, but a drunk 
mind doesn’t work so well. </p>
<p>“I...I want the Limited Edition Maximum-Strength Cup-Enhancement Booster from </p>
<p>IncrediBust!” </p>
<p>The table was surprisingly silent for the amount my friends had drunk. Even some of the </p>
<p>people around us paused their conversation to look in my direction. </p>

<p>“Who’s next??” one of the bartenders called out, holding a booster into the air. It was </p>
<p>small and silver, no doubt obtained through a promotion with the manufacturer. Several women 
put their hands up with cheers from their friends. 
“Over here!! Over here!!” Kally shouted.

<p>“I-I…” My heart was racing. I had only used a lactation booster once before at a

didn’t think I could hide my orgasm from a bar full of people. </p>

<p>Kally’s eyes were wide. “Look at you go! You look like you’re having the time of your </p>

mounting arousal in my nipples, core, and crotch! </p>
<p>I had to push back into the booth’s cushion. Skin was bulging out of the front of my dress </p>
<p>as if I were trying to hide a pair of basketballs. The cleavage extending from my own body in 
such a perfect, soft line made me wet. Fabric pulled at my back as the dress started to complain. 
It couldn’t stretch anymore. The idea of milk swirling under my skin like a couple of balloons 
made me wet. </p>
<p>“Lookin’ a little full there, Dawn!” Jasmine teased. “Kally! Better get some glasses </p>
<p>ready! I want som!” </p>
<p>“Waaaay ahead of you!” 
” I groaned. Below the table, my thighs were rubbing

​
together in mad gyrations. With the lactation booster’s stimulation, my milk glands were 
working overtime to produce such an exorbitant amount of dairy. Deep within the depths of my 
udders, I could feel each of them swelling and filling like tiny balloons, engorging me from the 
inside out. “</p>
<p>” 
Hah… G-God…!!! It’s not...stopping!!!
​</p>
<p>A creak came from a seam somewhere on my dress. I couldn’t tell you where; it was </p>
<p>hidden below the mammoth udders heaving off my torso.  </p>
<p>“</p>
<p>” I screamed before biting my lip when my strawberry nipples 
A-AAHHHMMMM!!!!
​</p>
<p>pressed into the edge of the table. Warmth was spreading across my fronts and I knew my 
capacity was nearing its limit. The warmth and leaking was a sure sign. I started leaning forward 
with the weight, hoping the milk falling in my lap would disguise other fluids. </p>
<p>“Uh uh! Keep ‘em above the table!” Kally demanded. A quick arm shot under my chest </p>
<p>and lifted them onto the table, letting them fall with a bloated sloshing. </p>
<p>“</p>

everyone. It was bad enough they were about to see my-- </p>

There they are!!
​
My nipples sprang free of my dress like party favors. I swear Kally was drooling over the </p>
<p>thin threads of milk leaking free. I was utterly exposed to anyone willing to look, and still I 
continued to fill. The chill of an ice water pressed into my milky skin and sent a bolting shiver 
through my body. Goosebumps speckled my chest and my nipples shot out at the chilly sensation 
like nozzles. The glass would have tipped over had Carlos’s reaction not been so quick. </p>

​</p>
<p>dress, dammit! How could I not orgasm after feeling myself get so big, milky, and-- </p>
<p>“Looks like I’m up!!” Kally’s hand shot out and grabbed a plump nipple. She twisted and </p>
<p>pulled, shooting a hot stream of milk into her shot glass like I was some kind of cow. </p>
<p>“</p>
<p>” It only intensified the rolling orgasm. My overly sensitive nipples flared 
W-W-WAIT!!!
​</p>
<p>and rocked my body to its core. I couldn’t help but throw my head back as Kally milked me in 
front of the entire bar. I would have been humiliated if my mind was on anything other than the 
pulsing in my panties. </p>
<p>Gasping for breath, I watched as Kally lifted an overflowing shot glass to her lips and </p>
<p>guzzled down my fluid. A white mustache lingered before she wiped it away with her tongue and 
a coy smile. </p>
<p>Licking a finger clean, she said, “Mmmmm, your milk is </p>

“Yay!! Good job, Dawn!!” Jasmine screamed. 
I received a standing ovation before everyone started going back to their own business. </p>
<p>Several other women endured the same torture, but none were quite the show I put on. </p>
<p>“Way to go, Bessie,” Kally joked. “Doing all right?? You look like we just took you off a </p>
<p>sex machine!” </p>
<p>“I…” Swallowing, I realized my mouth was bone dry. Producing so much milk took a lot </p>

​</p>
<p>The thought alone humored me. Mason was a good guy. A </p>
<p>guy, really. And boy did 
great 
​
he love tits. But spending over ten grand on something as frivolous as a booster? That was so far 
beyond the realm of reality it was laughable. Still...a girl could dream, right? </p>
<p>I stood in my closet meticulously choosing a dress for our traditional Christmas date. It 
didn’t have to be fancy, but skimpy enough to show off my body once Ol’ Faithful worked her 
magic. </p>
<p>A black dress hung in front of me. Usually it would have been an easy pick, but the front </p>
<p>was warped and blown out from the lactation ordeal several nights earlier.  </p>
<p>“God, I can’t believe I did that… What was wrong with me??” I groaned, finding the </p>
<p>dress still devoid of shape. “I ruined one of my favorite outfits!” </p>
<p>Did you think I regretted the lactation booster? HA! Not in the slightest. So I flashed a 
few people and sprayed milk like a sprinkler; drunk me didn’t care and current sober me was 
able to push it out of my mind. The point was I got 
before and I can assure you, they all measure up to the experience. Kally and Jasmine might have 
had a bit too much fun milking me like a farm animal, but that’s beside the point. </p>
<p>. I’ve had dreams like that 
maaaaassive
​</p>
<p>Mason was going to pick me up in less than half an hour and I wasn’t even dressed yet. </p>
<p>There wasn’t time to reminisce about orgasmic letdowns! Deciding on a seductive appearance, I 
snatched a festive red dress and slipped it over my body. It fit like a glove, save for the drooping 
fabric over my breasts. I wasn’t even large enough to support a sufficient amount of fabric to 
cover my nipples.

to branch out! </p>
<p>“Let’s see what you’ve got me tonig--
An end of the duct tape was losing its stick and a broken piece of my booster’s outer shell 
was hanging by one end. I held it back in place and pretended to have seen nothing. It was better 
for my sanity that way. </p>
<p>” 
oh!
​</p>
<p>Fully charged, I held its end into my chest and pulled the trigger.

<p>It whirred with strange effect, like a weak grinder working in the distance. The noise </p>
<p>wasn’t new, but it had never been so pronounced. Sometimes it could take a second or two for it 
to get its bearings and hit me. </p>
<p>“You can do it,” I encouraged, still holding the trigger and waiting for that pronounced </p>
<p>clicking sound. </p>
<p>WRRRRRRRR 
“Aaaany second now!” 
WRR-RRR-RRR--POP!!

​</p>
<p>apartment. It was weak; nowhere near what I was hoping for. </p>
<p>“No no no! Come on!” I groaned, pulling the trigger again. 
Nothing happened. Ol’ Faithful whirred like a car with a dying battery and only grew </p>
<p>weaker. I didn’t notice the increasing heat until it was too late. </p>
<p>KSHHZAP!! 
“
” 
Crap!!
​
Ol’ Faithful jumped in my hands before a piece of her outer shell exploded and sailed to a </p>
<p>corner of my room. Smoke and the smell of burning electronics reached my nose and I knew it 
was over. This was it, my booster was done for. They hadn’t made this model in years; repair 
was a pipedream. 
“
” I yelled, throwing it onto the bed. “It didn’t even--
DAMMIT!!
​
At least she didn’t leave me high and dry. I glanced down at my chest with pure hope but 
I knew I couldn’t expect much. The influx of energy had been so small I would be lucky to even 
have cleavage. </p>
<p>” 
mmm…
​</p>
<p>My breasts swelled as if they were tired. Perky roundness filled them out at a snail’s </p>
<p>pace. I was overjoyed just to see them gain enough weight for my skin to fold over and pass the 
pencil test. </p>
<p>“Come on! C-Come...on!” I begged, still enjoying the little bit of pleasure accompanying </p>
<p>my enhancement. </p>
<p>just before the growth peetered off. </p>
<p>The dress lifted across them and I started to fill into the cups. Padding tickled my nipples </p>
<p>“No! Please no!!” I was at a loss. I couldn’t have been bigger than a C-cup. Can you </p>
<p>believe it?! A 
 I couldn’t even hope to form cleavage without the help of a bra! There was

​
no justice. The world was going to be a dark, hard place from now on without my soft pillows. I 
had only a handful of hours until they shrank away and left me with nothing. In a kinder world, 
Ol’ Faithful’s malfunction would have sent some kind of rogue zap into my body to make my 
boobs blow up to some gorgeous, permanent size. But not here. This was the real world and 
boosters don’t work that way. Ever wonder if you might have an addiction? </p>
<p>Mason was going to be so disappointed. No doubt he was expecting to find a girl 
overflowing her dress with a pair of wobbling, head-sized Christmas ornaments he could bury </p>

would have to be tightened if I wanted any kind of support. </p>
<p>DING DONG! 
The doorbell rang several minutes later. Still moping, I grabbed my purse and dragged </p>
<p>myself to open it. My boyfriend stood there with a holiday-themed bouquet of flowers smelling 
of scented pinecones.  </p>
<p>“Hey, babe!” he greeted. I followed his eyes to my lack-luster bust and saw his smile turn </p>
<p>into a perplexed slant. “Going a little more conservative, huh? That’s new!” </p>
<p>“My booster broke…” I mumbled, crossing my arms over my chest. Normally, that </p>
<p>wasn’t supposed to be possible. </p>
<p>Mason must have sensed my despair. If he was torn up about it, he was doing a great job </p>
<p>of hiding it. The flowers pressed into my back when he hugged me. “Well that’s ok! I’m still 
taking the most beautiful girl out to a Christmas dinner! You don’t

​</p>
<p>Looking at the floor, I grumbled like a child, “I like torturing my dresses…” 
“We can see what we can do about fixing it!” 
I frowned. “I was going to let you dress me up however you wanted and then make me </p>
<p>grow into it tonight…” </p>
<p>Mason looked like he had just missed a prime investment opportunity. Bless his 
titty-loving heart though, he turned it around. “I just would have torn the clothes off you 
anyway!” </p>
<p>My stomach growled, betraying my sour mood. 
“You hungry?” he asked. 
“Yea…” 
“You’ll feel better after you eat something. I promise!” 
He was right. Within an hour, the smell of the restaurant alone helped ease my loss. As 
heavenly as the food was, it just wasn’t the same without feeling my boobs fighting against the 
table’s edge. Oddly enough, I still caught Mason staring down my dress. </p>

​</p>
<p>Mason winked. “Well, there are a lot of sales going on right now! Maybe we can go </p>

<p>​

<p>You’re damn-well right there was a model I’ve had my eye on. My eye and most of my </p>
<p>conscious mind. It probably wasn’t healthy how much it’s been in my thoughts and dreams. 
Regardless, I wasted no time in blurting out, “I want the Limited Edition Maximum-Strength 
Cup-Enhancement Booster from IncrediBust!” </p>
<p>Mason coughed on his food and had to use his napkin to prevent spraying me in chunks 
from his laughter. Finding his composure after a check-in from our worried waiter, he looked at 
me with watery eyes. “I-Isn’t that the one that costs around a down payment on a small house??” </p>
<p>“Y-Yes…” I shrunk into my chair, much like my chest soon would. 
“Dawn, trust me, I would

​
“We’ll see what we can find, ok?” 
“Ok…” Whatever we might find even remotely in my budget, it wouldn’t be the Limited </p>
<p>Edition Maximum-Strength Cup-Enhancement Booster from IncrediBust. More than likely it 
would be less powerful than Ol’ Faithful and designed to break in a year. </p>
<p>Mason’s foot traveled higher and tickled the insides of my lower thighs. “Does it help </p>
<p>that I still can’t wait to rip that dress off you?” </p>
<p>I couldn’t help but blush. Other diners could definitely hear us, but I found it a little </p>
<p>exciting after my dairy rush at the bar. “A-A little,” I admitted. </p>
<p>“Good, because I’ve been itching to get my lips on those perky little tits all through </p>
<p>dinner. I can’t remember the last time I saw you with those cute nipples!” </p>
<p>Needless to say, the check was paid within the next ten minutes and Mason was racing to 
my apartment before the clock struck twelve on the last of Ol’ Faithful’s boosts. We managed to 
enjoy a good amount of fun with my C-cups before I felt them wearing away. Mason’s hands 
were on them with his lips latched around a nipple when they shrunk. I was strangely 
embarrassed, similar to what I imagine a man feels like when he loses his hard-on during sex. 
Mason didn’t miss a beat, though. He sucked as if I were as big as ever, not to mention I was 
more agile in bed than I had been in a long time. I guess the night didn’t turn out so bad, </p>

<p>Still, as I lie naked in his arms in the dark trying to find sleep, I wondered how long it </p>
<p>would be until I could overflow my bra again. Chances were slim we would find anything 
affordable. Maybe a lost IncrediBust would find its way to me. Surely there was a

A knock on my door tore me from my sleep far sooner than was fair. My joyous pair of </p>
<p>friends lunging at me with open arms and well wishes nearly took me off my feet.  </p>
<p>“Heeeeey, guys!” I couldn’t believe they were actually here at eight in the morning. A </p>
<p>morning I was supposed to be sleeping in with Mason in my cozy bed away from this cold, 
snowless Christmas devoid of breasts. “Were we...actually serious about doing this?” </p>
<p>“Duh!” Jasmine pulled away from her hug and entered my apartment after wiping the </p>
<p>water from her boots. </p>
<p>“Am I right in assuming you didn’t get us anything, then?” Kally feigned a pout. 
“W-Well, I wasn’t planning on

Oh my God! I LOVE your tree, Dawn!
​</p>
<p>“And don’t worry! We got the pajamas!” </p>
<p>“We were serious on that too, huh…” I moaned. Christmas Eve had been a little rough on </p>
<p>me, all right? I’m allowed to be a bit slow. Sex can be rough and drawn out when your two 
favorite toys are missing. </p>
<p>“I didn’t know we were having a party…!” 
We turned to see Mason shuffling from my room. Sleep was heavy in his eyes but I could </p>
<p>still make out a child-like twinkle present only for Christmas morning. Poor guy was dragged 
around town all day yesterday looking for a new booster. Most department stores were closed 
and even those who were open had boosters with prices it hurt to look at. I think he enjoyed the 
few demos they had available to try, though. Even if they did only last five minutes. </p>
<p>“Morning, Mason! You look tired. Up all night playing with Dawn’s big--” Kally 
stopped, noticing my mom’s pajamas weren’t filled out. “Tell me my eyes deceive me! Where 
are your boobs, Dawn?? Are you feeling all right??” She gasped, putting a hand over her mouth. 
“We didn’t interrupt you two at the start of some sexy booster role-play did we??” </p>

<p>Jasmine at least tried to console me. “Stop it, can’t you see she’s sad? Dawn loved that </p>
<p>source of free drinks!” </p>
<p>thing. I’m sorry...” </p>
<p>Kally turned to my boyfriend. “How are you holding up, Mason? Did you need to use a </p>
<p>real pillow for the first time last night since dating her?” </p>
<p>I could tell Mason was shocked by her accuracy. “He’s taken it much better than I have!” </p>
<p>It was time to change the subject. I tried to mentally slap myself awake and into the spirit. The 
gentle drizzle outside wasn’t helping. What’s Christmas without snow? “Who wants coffee?? I 
have eggnog!” </p>
<p>“Eggnog, yes please,” Mason swooned with sleep deprivation. 
“We already had one or two energy drinks!” Jasmine confessed. That explained a lot. 
Kally set a stack of gifts in my living room. “I love your tree, Dawn!” 
“Thanks! I got it at the last minute!” It was full and heavily flocked with fake snow. 
Coffee was the savior I needed. I wasn’t going to let my lack of breasts spoil a perfectly </p>
<p>good Christmas morning with my lover and friends. There was mountains of merriment to be 
had! I could worry about filling out my clothes later. </p>
<p>“Let’s do presents!” 
Mason and I hadn’t even had a chance to catch our breath. Handling my friends made us </p>
<p>feel like an old married couple surrounded my children and their new toys hidden under shiny 
paper. I was starting to understand why Jasmine’s parents needed a cruise; somehow my friends 
regressed to children on Christmas morning. </p>
<p>No sooner had I sat down than a long, flat box was shoved in my lap. Jasmine looked </p>
<p>ready to burst. “Here, Dawn! Open your pajamas first!” </p>
<p>“Are you sure we don’t want to relax and wake up a little bit before we--” 
“
” 
Open it!
​
She was going to wake the entire apartment building if I didn’t do what she asked. </p>
<p>Setting my coffee on the table, I tore open the wrapping paper and lifted the lid. </p>
<p>A pair of long, pink bunny ears sprang into the air. “Oh...my God…” I stared in horror. 
“Do you </p>
<p>?? Kally and I spent all weekend looking for the perfect pair of pajamas to 
love it
​</p>
<p>give you.” </p>
<p>It was a pink monstrosity. A full-body, fleece bunny suit complete with bunny-head </p>
<p>slippers. A zipper ran up the front designed to encase some poor sap like me. </p>
<p>Mason snorted back a chuckle beside me. “Sorry,” he laughed, “But you’re going to look </p>
<p>in that.” 
adorable 
​</p>
<p>“I-I’m not actually going to--” </p>
<p>​
​
​
 </p>
<p>21 </p>
<p>“Put it on! Put it on!” Jasmine clapped. 
“My mom already made pajamas for me! It would be rude to--” 
Kally smirked. “It’s the </p>
<p>you could do after you forgot we were coming. Jasmine was 
least
​</p>
<p>excited about our new tradition… Look at that face…” 
so
​</p>
<p>I had to admit, Jasmine was a certifiable expert with the puppy-dog eyes. 
“You gotta put that on,” Mason agreed. “I promise it 
Groaning, I pulled the costume from the box and dragged it towards my room. “Fine. </p>

might
​</p>
<p>Fine!! I’ll be the Easter Bunny for Christmas!” </p>
<p>Jasmine was ecstatic. “I knew she would love it!” 
“Merry Christmas!” Kally called out. I held up a loving finger in return before I closed </p>
<p>my bedroom door. These were going to be the best pictures I could hope to find all over my 
social media. </p>
<p>I undressed down to my bra and underwear before standing in front of my fate. “I really 
need to stop letting them drink so much,” I sighed. The sooner I put it on the sooner I could take 
it off. </p>
<p>I emerged as a giant pink rabbit to a room full of grins. My ears slapped the top of the </p>
<p>door frame when I stepped out. Kally was enjoying my torture while Jasmine was actually 
overjoyed. Mason was more than amused. If he was actually imagining me stripping for him 
while wearing this, I might have to reevaluate my taste in men. 
“
” Jasmine squealed. 
Oh my God! You’re so precious!!
​
Kally twirled a finger, holding her phone into the air. “Turn around! Show us the whole </p>
<p>package!”  </p>
<p>cottontail on my ass. </p>
<p>new tradition.” </p>
<p>I could almost hear the internet giggle when I spun and showed off the giant white </p>
<p>“Mason, how does this make you feel? Awaken anything inside of you?” Kally asked. 
“Dawn,” he said, trying to hold back his smile on my account, “I think we might have a </p>
<p>“Yea? Just wait until you see what I find for you next year then!” 
“My turn!” Jasmine grabbed a present from the pile. Of course her own pajamas were </p>
<p>normal for an adult her age. “Thanks, Kally! I love them!” </p>
<p>“Go put ‘em on!” 
Jasmine ran past me while I slumped into the couch next to Mason. A hand flipped an ear </p>
<p>on my head like a cat. “Should I get you a carrot?” he asked. </p>
<p>“Mmmm, sorry, this bunny only eats sausage,” I breathed hotly, brushing a finger against </p>
<p>his crotch. I knew he wasn’t wearing boxers and I delighted in seeing his face go red and the 
front of his sweat pants tent up. Kally seemed to as well. If I had to suffer so much 
embarrassment, Mason was getting a healthy dose as well. </p>
<p>Kally purred. “Get a room, you two! Mason, I could help you tie a bow around that for </p>
<p>her if you want…” </p>
<p>​
​
​
 </p>
<p>22 </p>
<p>“How do I look??” Jasmine interrupted, clad in bright blue pajamas. She didn’t wait long </p>
<p>before sitting on the floor ready to continue. “Your turn, Kally!” </p>
<p>Kally’s face lit up when she pulled silk and lace from a bag. It was a spaghetti-strap teddy </p>
<p>with only enough length to cover the top half of her hips. Somehow it looked 
than just being naked. </p>
<p>revealing 
more
​</p>
<p>“Do I know you or what??” Jasmine giggled. 
“I think you might get a thank you card from the next guy I bring home!” Kally gaped. A </p>
<p>devilish smile flashed. “Guess I should put it on huh?” </p>
<p>I tore it from her hands before anyone could answer and stuffed it between a couch </p>
<p>cushion. “Nope!! We’re one skimpy outfit and a group picture away from having the strangest 
Christmas card on record.” </p>
<p>“Aww…” Jasmine was disappointed, sad Kally couldn’t take part. 
“Don’t worry, I’ll put it on when she’s not looking,” Kally whispered. 
After the pajama fiasco, Christmas morning continued as expected. Gifts were passed </p>
<p>around and we all fawned over everyone’s thoughtfulness. Mason bought me a beautiful sweater 
I would have loved to fill out for him. He could see the longing in my sad bunny eyes and 
hugged me all the same. Despite the constant teasing and humiliation, I was really surrounded by 
some great friends. Luckily I had presents under the tree for Kally and Jasmine, they were just 
meant to be given at a later time. Before long, the flurry of torn paper died down. </p>
<p>“Looks like you have the last gift, Dawn!” Kally announced, grabbing a smaller box from </p>
<p>her feet. </p>
<p>“Hang on!” Mason jumped up and ran into our bedroom. My comically-large bunny ears </p>
<p>could hear him rifling through some of my things on the higher shelves. He returned soon 
enough with a box wrapped in sparkling silver paper. “I’ve got one more for her!” </p>
<p>“Where the hell was that??” I gaped. I knew my closet like the top of my cleavage. 
It was placed in my lap like a child. “I hid it while you were sleeping. Open it!” 
The box was a little larger than a toaster. I could tell from the paper and folds that it was 
not Mason who wrapped it. There was a satisfying weight to it, too. My desperate, titty-starved 
mind likened it to Ol’ Faithful. 
“What is it??” I stared. 
Kally was impatient, bouncing her remaining gift on her knee. “I bet I know how you </p>
<p>could find out!” </p>
<p>I tore into the paper like an animal. I knew there was little chance of it containing </p>
<p>anything remotely close to what I hoped. The first glimpse of the box’s design made my heart 
palpitate. </p>
<p>“Mason, no…” I gasped, seeing the letters ‘crediBu’ showing through a tear in the paper. 
“Open it!” he encouraged. </p>
<p>​
 </p>
<p>23 </p>
<p>I don’t remember tearing the rest of it off. Suddenly there was just a pristine box 
illustrating the booster of my dreams sitting in my pink bunny lap. Across the top read ‘Limited 
Edition Maximum-Strength Cup-Enhancement Booster’, by who other than IncrediBust. </p>
<p>“Mason… M-Mason…” I couldn’t breathe. Kally and Jasmine’s eyes were just as wide. </p>
<p>“
” I think I was 
Mason if this is some kind of a joke!! This better not be some kind of joke!!
​
screeching. “I swear to God, if there is a rock inside this box!” </p>
<p>There wasn’t time to wait for any kind of assurance. The box didn’t stand a chance 
against my strength. It flipped open and there sat the IncrediBust I had dreamed about, nestled so 
precisely in a bed of black foam. It was even shinier in person. Crisp red stripes reflected a dark 
crimson. </p>
<p>“Wow…” Jasmine gaped. She was speechless for once. Kally looked like she forgot how </p>
<p>to blink. 
“</p>
<p>” I screamed, diving into a hug. My bunny ears slapped his face. I felt like a 
MASON!!
​</p>
<p>child on Christmas morning opening their dream gift. That kid screeching about a shiny new N64 
and Mario Kart? That was me right now. “How?! HOW?! I-It’s so much!!” Honestly the TV 
commercial undersold this thing; it was a gorgeous piece of titty-based technology. I felt like I 
was about to explode from excitement. “</p>
<p>” 
How...?? WHEN?!
​</p>
<p>Mason must have noticed my getting overwhelmed and gave me a hug to calm me down </p>
<p>before I passed out. “Easy, easy! I’ve had it for a few weeks now.” </p>
<p>” 
WHAT?!?!
​</p>
<p>“...
 Are you actually some kind of secret millionaire??” Kally wondered, eying my

new toy. </p>
<p>He was getting far too much pleasure out of my ordeal. “I swear I’m not! It’s a funny </p>
<p>story, really. You should really be thanking Kyle.” </p>
<p>“Kyle from college??” I asked, heart racing. I hadn’t even touched it yet; it was too </p>
<p>exciting and precious to mess it up with fingerprints. </p>
<p>“That’s him. He works at IncrediBust! We had drinks a few weeks ago and it turns out 
they were raffling off a few of these babies at their company Christmas party and he was lucky 
enough to win one! But you know, Kyle is--” </p>
<p>“Gay,” I finished for him. 
“Yea, so he’s didn’t have much use for it. So he offered it to me!” 
“Holy crap! </p>
<p>” What were the chances? I didn’t know what to think or how to 
Holy crap!
​</p>
<p>act. “Thank you, Mason! Thank you!” </p>
<p>He chuckled and sipped from a spiked coffee. “We’ll see if you’re still thanking me when </p>
<p>I’m booked helping Kyle put in his paver patio for a month come Summer.” </p>
<p>“I think you might have earned yourself a good time tonight, Mason,” Kally giggled. </p>
<p>“Look at her! Dawn is like a toddler with a new puppy!” </p>
<p>Jasmine was loving the energy. “I’m starving! We should all go get some breakfast </p>
<p>and--” </p>

<p>A high-pitch whirring filled the room before she could finish her thought. All three pairs </p>
<p>of eyes turned to me in horror. What? Did you think I was going to 
Have you been </p>
<p>at all?! 
listening 
​</p>
<p>to try this thing out?? 
wait
​</p>
<p>Mason’s eyes bulged when I turned the dial to max strength. The booster’s whine </p>
<p>heightened, the mechanics priming a charge for my waiting bunny body. “U-Uhhhh, Dawn 
maybe we should hold off. Or at least make start a little slower?” </p>
<p>Hell no. His warning went in one ear and out the other as the booster pressed against my </p>
<p>chest through the bunny suit. </p>
<p>“Oh this should be fun,” Kally grinned, watching me finger the trigger. 
Click! 
A pleasure bomb erupted in my chest. This was nowhere close to what Ol’ Faithful felt </p>
<p>like. This was pure power, refined and reworked over many years for the sole purpose of 
enlarging breasts. From the surge of energy alone I was actually worried about my rash decision. 
Only for a moment. After that, I stopped caring. </p>
<p>“
” 
Oh…. OOH!! Holy shit!!
​
“Dawn? Are you all right?” Jasmine asked, seeing me double over on the couch. I wasn’t 
expecting such a rush, nor were my little A-cups. Maybe the instructions would have told me not 
to hit such small boobs with the highest setting. </p>
<p>Kally snorted. “Oh I think she’s more than all right. I have a feeling you might want to </p>
<p>move, Jasmine.” </p>
<p>“Hey,” Mason said, putting a hand on my trembling back. “Do they feel--” 
I panted with my head between my knees and my hands clenched to my boobs. I could </p>
<p>feel them heating up in my grasp like a couple of tiny engines. “M-Mason...
going to have...s-so much...fun with...</p>
<p>...this...thing.” 
nnngh
​
I shot back into the couch. It was starting. There was no stopping the process now, nor 
would I ever want to. Arching my back, I lifted a pair of grapefruits already blooming off my 
chest into the air, tenting out my bunny suit with erotic hills. </p>
<p>We are 
oh God...
​</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>” I was ecstatic. My growth was so intense I hardly had time to guess my 
Ahh!! Ah ahh!!
​
size before the cup was irrelevant. </p>
<p>“Oh damn!” Kally awed, eyes widening as I swelled like a couple of ripening melons.<br />
I was filling out my bra faster than a college test in the last thirty seconds of class. Within </p>
<p>a few short gasps, I could see the outline of its padding pressing against my pink PJs. Around it 
was an onslaught of heaving flesh threatening to engulf the tiny cups into their mass. The bra 
wasn’t budging, and it sure as hell wasn’t loosening. The excitement of feeling it cut into my 
torso was almost frightening. </p>
<p>“T-They’re not...stopping! </p>
<p>” I cheered. 
Look at my tits!!
​
I could no longer see my legs over the pink mountains rising before me. Under my suit, skin was 
seeking out any available room for its weighty girth. My bloating knockers stretched and shifted, </p>
<p>MMMMM they’re not stopping!!

<p>rubbing over the top of my stomach and pushing into my collarbones. I was starting to look like 
an awkwardly pregnant Easter Bunny. </p>
<p>“Heeeey! Don’t break your pajamas!” Jasmine complained, “We just got you those!” 
She was right. As much as I wanted to, tearing them to shreds would be rude when I </p>
<p>hadn’t worn them for more than an hour. Besides, I wanted to stand up. Feeling two 
watermelon’s worth of weight wobbling on top of my arching chest was bliss, but I wanted to 
feel gravity </p>
<p>give me a run for my money. 
really
​</p>
<p>“Careful, careful!” Mason worried when I let my chest carry me forward. 
I ignored him, using the momentum to stand to swaying feet. 
CREEAAAAAK 
My bra complained when It actually had to support me. I felt like a whale suspended in a 
hammock from the way I was overflowing my little A-cups. A pink slope extended from my chin 
and inflated the bunny suit like a fat man. Had it not been for my bra slung under my tits, I think 
they would have reached my hips with ease. </p>
<p>“W-Whoa…” I swooned, wrapping an arm around my chest and flailing another for </p>
<p>balance. Now I knew what an upside-down bowling pin felt like. “These 
are...</p>
<p>...heavy!” 
m-mmm!!
​
CREEAAAAKK 
POP!!! 
Strange noises were coming from my clothes. I didn’t know if stitches were blowing on </p>
<p>my bra or the suit, but something was going to give soon. In fairness, I did try to unzip and 
release my expanding assets. Lucky for me, the zipper was cheap and jammed under my chin. </p>
<p>“I-It’s stuck!” I gasped, feeling the cacoon of fabric deforming my chest. “</p>
<p>Mmmmm </p>
<p>” 
ooohhhh it’s stuck!! It’s getting...tighter!!
​
It’s possible I was enjoying myself </p>
<p>too much. No one seemed to mind, 
way, waaaay
​</p>
<p>though. Mason was rock hard and made no effort to hide it. Kally was simply entertained and 
smirking with a strange smile. Jasmine… Well, I never really know what Jasmine is thinking, but 
she had a goofy smile on her face. </p>
<p>My bra cups were overflowing with my nipples. A gentle touch of my hand was all it </p>
<p>took to feel my areolas bulging around it in swollen domes and send a violent shiver down my 
spine. Still my tits burned with growth, the IncrediBust’s work not done. </p>
<p>CREEAAAKK!!! 
“M-My...BRA!! It’s so...damn tight!!! It’s 
Skin was pushing into the sleeves and out of the collar. I could only imagine the true </p>
<p>” 
overflowing!
​</p>
<p>shape and size of my udders; deformed by the straps of my resilient bra, I looked closer to a pink 
raspberry. </p>
<p>“Grow...</p>
<p>” I started gasping, 
G-Grow!! I want to be big… Oooohhhh I wanna be big!
​
taking as deep of breaths as I could muster. This was bra coming off, one way or another. </p>
<p>CREEEAAAK!!!! </p>
<p>​
​
​
​
​
​
 </p>
<p>26 </p>
<p>“Jesus, Dawn! How big are you going to get?!” Kally laughed while watching me totter </p>
<p>like a human balloon. </p>
<p>Sweat was pouring down my body. I could feel my cleavage sliding against itself and I </p>
<p>grew afraid I might tumble out of my bra before it met its maker. Wrapping my arms around the 
bottom of my chest like a pregnant belly, I sentenced my bra to death. </p>
<p>...on!! 
nnngh
​</p>
<p>“C-Come…
BANG!!! 
A shockwave rocketed around my chest at supersonic speed. I couldn’t tell you where, </p>
<p>” 
God I’m so big…!! How the fuck is it still--
​</p>
<p>but my bra snapped at several places simultaneously as I engorged well beyond the size of beach 
balls.  </p>
<p>“
” 
MMM!!! MMMMNNNGHHH!!! GOD!!
​
It was everything I hoped it would be and more. My nipples sang with the sting of </p>
<p>snapped spandex, their sensitivity through the roof and their puffed cylinders sticking into the 
thinning bunny suit like small jars. Without its support, my chest rushed to as natural shape as 
much as the suit allowed. Hot skin rubbed across my hips before stopping at the legs. At this 
point I looked like a bunny bloating from the bottom up. </p>
<p>“She’s actually going to fill that thing!” Kally predicted. 
Mason was speechless. His hand was twitching from the mental effort of not touching </p>
<p>himself, or me. 
“</p>
<p>” I breathed, my tits relentless. 
Mmmm that booster is...more powerful than...I thought!
​</p>
<p>Skin rubbed and squeaked against my body, the tightness rising higher and higher up my torso as 
the suit ran out of room by my hips. It looked as though I had a massive belly extending a foot on 
either side of me and two fists sticking angrily outward where my nipples should be. </p>
<p>Running my hands over my growing form, I cupped my nipples and felt an orgasm shoot </p>
<p>through me. I used to not even be able to fill my hands with my breasts. Now my nipples were 
big enough to overflow my palms and massaging fingers. My knees knocked together from the 
pleasure. I would never be able to stand fully upright again; it was all I could handle just to stay 
still with so much weight. </p>
<p>POP! 
POP POP!! 
Stitches were sounding the retreat on the bunny suit. Seams deformed and warped in </p>
<p>every direction as I rounded out near my shoulders. A pair of tits like exercise balls were stuffed 
inside the poor pajamas and they were dying to get out. </p>
<p>“It’s...it’s too much…” I moaned, the tight fabric massaging my nipples for me. I felt like 
a blimp stuffed inside a sock. Could they see the wet spot soaking the crotch? My legs trembled 
from pleasure and orgasms, their muscles weakening from the strain. “
Ooohhhh MMMM GOD 
” 
IT’S...SO GOOD!!!
​</p>
<p>WHAM!! </p>
<p>​
​
​
​
​
 </p>
<p>27 </p>
<p>I fell backward and landed in a mighty heap on my butt, knocking into the coffee table 
and spilling someone’s coffee. I didn’t care, I was too busy feeling like a water balloon as the 
force made my chest flatten and spread in all directions around my body. The suit was almost 
able to handle the pressure until-- </p>
<p>POW!!! 
The zipper burst open. An avalanche of freed tit-flesh rushed from my front before I </p>
<p>could react. Leaning back on my arms for support, I stared at the jiggling piles dominating my 
torso and flowing around my thighs. Had my knees not been bent up, I would have been buried 
to my ankles. Sitting atop my cleavage was the remains of my bra, tattered and torn. With a 
moan I felt my growth come to an end. Putting a hand on top of my right breast with 
overwhelming fulfillment, I looked up at my observers with a sheepish grin and proud nipples. </p>
<p>“Heh… S-Sorry about...</p>
<p>...that…” I panted, my ears drooping from exhaustion. It 
mmm
​</p>
<p>was unbelievable how much my hand sank into my chest. I was massive yet more luxurious than 
memory foam. Based on the pillow covering Mason’s lap, I think he enjoyed the show as much 
as I did. </p>
<p>“What did I tell you?? You blew your bra open!!” Kally laughed. “It didn’t take you </p>
<p>more than thirty seconds before that thing was turned on high! Are you nuts?!” </p>
<p>“Wow…” Jasmine’s eyes were like full moons. She crept closer on the floor before </p>
<p>poking a finger into my depths. </p>
<p>​
 </p>
<p>28 </p>
<p>“</p>
<p>” I cried out, crotch throbbing. Every inch of my jugs was alive and 
M-MMM! Careful…!
​
packed with engorged nerves.  </p>
<p>“Hehe, they’re so soft!” she giggled, pressing hard and sending a wave across my body. 
I didn’t even know how long the growth was set to last. The intensity was the only dial I </p>
<p>had been concerned with. I might be stuck with these giant knockers for the next three days! 
What could be better? </p>
<p>“How was that for you?” Kally asked Mason. He stammered to answer but she </p>
<p>interrupted. “Hope you’re not wiped out! We still have one present to go!” </p>
<p>That’s right, Kally was about to give me something before Mason dropped a massive titty </p>
<p>bomb. I was grateful, but whatever it was, it wasn’t going to be as magnificent as the 
IncrediBust. Mason had won Christmas for the next decade or more. </p>
<p>“I’ll open it for you,” Kally winked as I sat trapped on the floor, “You look a little </p>
<p>.” 
indisposed
​</p>
<p>The paper tore away and Kally donned a devilish smile. When she held up a box </p>
<p>depicting a small silver booster I knew why. </p>
<p>“Hmmm, I wonder what this is!” she hummed. 
Was I dreaming? I didn’t deserve any of this! “Kally, oh my God! Did you--” 
A small booster was pulled from the box, resembling the one from the bar. I gulped. 
“After seeing how much you enjoyed that lactation booster the other night, I couldn’t </p>
<p>pass this up when I saw it on sale! It’s not as new of a model, but it packs a hell of a punch. And 
your old booster was on its last legs… But I had 
that! Way to take my thunder,” she growled. </p>
<p>idea Mason was going to show me up like 
no
​</p>
<p>“What can I say?” he shrugged, more than happy with his deed. 
“Kally, I don’t know what to say!” I said in total shock. “T-Thank you! I can’t wait to try </p>
<p>it! I-If I wasn’t...</p>
<p>...stuck right now, I would hug you!” 
mmm
​</p>
<p>“Don’t mention it,” she waved before standing up and approaching me. She stood over 
my stranded form. I was expecting a warm hug until I heard her flip a switch. The booster was 
still in her hands. “Why wait??” </p>
<p>I struggled, trying to stand. “W-Wait, Kally! Maybe we shouldn’t--” 
The tip of the lactation booster sank into my chest a split second before she pulled the </p>
<p>trigger and delivered her gift. 
GRRRMMMBLLEEE 
“Merry Christmas!” Kally wished over the sound of a deep, rumbling slosh emanating </p>
<p>from my mammoth tits.  </p>
<p>“</p>
<p>” I moaned, 
W-W-Wait! Ohhhh… My...M-My tits!! Kally! What did...MMMM...you do?!
​</p>
<p>watching my cleavage start to shift and rise. </p>
<p>The gurgles were getting louder as each and every one of my stimulated milk glands 
sprang to life. There wasn’t room for something like this! I was bigger than our coffee table and I 
was about to fill to the brim with milk! My legs were already being forced to the floor by my </p>
<p>​
​
​
​
 </p>
<p>29 </p>
<p>soon-to-be-titanic udders’ engorging weight. If my previous growth was a garden hose, I was 
about to feel the wrath of a milky fire hydrant. A small leak was already running down my front 
from my swollen nipples as they flared and quivered. </p>
<p>“And a happy New Year!” Jasmine cheered, leaping towards my chest with a growling </p>
<p>stomach. My eyes bulged realizing my nipples were unprotected from her hunger. 
“Jasmine! 
” 
J-Jasmine!! AUGH!! Wait! Mason do something!! I’m about to--
​
He had his phone out. He was fucking recording this like some kind of home movie we </p>
<p>would watch years from now and laugh at! </p>
<p>“S-Seriously?! Guys my milk is going to come in and--</p>
<p>AHH! Jasmine! Be gentle!! </p>

A-Ahh!! MMM!! GOD!! I’M GOING TO BE SO FUCKING FUUUULL!!
​</p>
<p>I was forced onto my back when my chest engorged in all directions, bloating larger by </p>
<p>the milk surging against my skin. Feeling my tits pulse and stretch across my body was 
pleasurable beyond imagination. My lactation was nowhere near completion; I could feel my 
body just getting started. This was a dream come true. I bit my lip and let the ecstasy take me 
away as my production gurgled and increased, spraying milk from my nipples like dairy 
fountains coating everything and everyone in sight. </p>
<p>As it turns out, I was going to get my white Christmas after all.  </p>
