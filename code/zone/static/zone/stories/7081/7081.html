<p><strong>Yuri's Antiques: The Masterpiece\
#5</strong></p>
<p>By: Specter09</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This is a work of fiction with adult themes. If you are
under the age of 18 or it is illegal for you to view this in your place
of residence, please turn away and find something else to do. This work
is strictly fantasy and does not reflect the author's real life values.</p>
<p>This story was an attempt at practicing 2^nd^ person perspective and a
tg theme. If that isn't your style, you've been forewarned.</p>
<p>If you are still here, please continue reading and enjoy!</p>
<p>The piece was massive -- far larger than anything you thought Marcie was
going to actually buy. She claimed it was a steal, a meager Benjamin
when other comparably sized works would sell for tens to hundreds of
Benjamins. Regardless, it was still insanely large -- you had let her
decorate the interior of the house, but couldn't fathom why she got
something so large and expensive with their limited budget -- the ink
drawn masterpiece was nearly as tall as the wall and almost as long as
your six person dining room table.</p>
<p>"Look, I know it's a lot, but it's a wonderful discussion piece and
there's so much to look at! You could just get lost in it!" Marcie
beamed, trying her best to win you back over. She had been pushing hard
to convince you to upgrade the interior. You had both been in it for
over three years, and she wanted to update the look a bit. She had
eventually sold you on a budget of her choice and free reign so long as
she limited your help. The past year had been rough, you had been laid
off at first and each interview fell flat. You couldn't carry the same
appeal through a screen for interview as you could in person -- your
confident mannerisms dissipated as they traveled through the digital
nexus. It had been ten months and you weren't sure that you could
recover that confidence again. Failure after failure seemed to haunt you
like a poltergeist.</p>
<p>Yuri was his name -- the antique dealer that Marcie had apparently
bought the piece from. If had any shred of that confidence left, you'd
promptly take the masterpiece back and demand a full refund from the
man. Marcie told you that it had captivated here -- almost like hypnosis
as she was traveling in the store. Yuri had stirred her from her stare
and promptly presented an analysis of the masterpiece like a seasoned
purveyor of such things.</p>
<p>The masterpiece was apocalyptic. Yet, not in the conventional modern
western idea of it. It was revelatory, a revelation piece that would
unveil truth about individuals. When a person was enthralled by its
intricate details, it was in the process of awakening the thrall to the
truth of themselves. The branches would guide the partaking of its
curiosities to discover something long slumbering within themselves.</p>
<p>And you had to agree to an extent -- it was truly a masterpiece,
something actually worthy of that grand title. At a glance, from a
distance, there was a behemoth of a tree, much like Yggdrasil itself.
It's branches and roots wrapped and moved like pythons over the space of
the canvas, each guiding the eye to a new theme; a new plane of
existence. Not only was there much to behold, but each sector of the
painting had an explosion of color that countered the muted earth tones
of the bark. The tree alone, with its explosion of color acting as a
sort of wondrous crown adorning the branches.</p>
<p>But a closer inspection unveiled fine details -- a seemingly infinite
amount of minor things, of people practicing their comings and goings, a
tidy and miniscule hustle and bustle. The tree was embedded with the
works of man, street signs, lamp posts, cars, rice terraces, protests,
sports, skyscrapers, farmers farming, nomads wandering, people
celebrating and weeping, ancient ruins, and more -- if it had ever been
built by human hands or crossed the imagination of a homo sapien, like a
comet in the sky even once, it found immortalization in the dark, bold
lines of the artists' ink pen. You had to agree -- it was sort of
living, breathing labyrinth that reached out with inky gentle fingers
and beckoned you to lose yourself in its intricacies.</p>
<p>Yet to even attempt to zoom back out from the details was to recognize
the more moderately sized images, compiled of those minor little human
activities, that they themselves contributed to the structure of the
grand tree. Larger human forms could be made out in the abstract, their
forms a concoction of a myriad of other things.</p>
<p>Realizing the draw, the aura of power and attraction it had, like vines
attempting to seize your eyes, you shake yourself free. Yet, even as you
break free, it takes a moment for reality to find you. Everything was a
moving blur that slowly worked itself back to a realignment of sorts.
You focused on yourself first, taking stock like Descartes, before
tethering yourself to you wife.</p>
<p>Your inventory reveals nothing new, just a reminder of the fat you
accumulated over the past year -- nearly thirty extra pounds of weight.
Food had been your primary comforter rather than the missus. Talking
with Marcie was to enter a confrontation with your inner beasts and the
constant strife of the year had worn you down to the point where such a
conflict was the last thing you wanted. Chips on the other hand did not
attempt to challenge you nor your demons, but to simply placate them for
the time being. Appeasement was preferable to war.</p>
<p>Marcie, however, had thrived during their struggles of the past year.
She took the extra time working from home had given her to improve her
skills in cooking, to exercise more, and to pursue new hobbies in
literature and writing -- she had even gotten published in a few online
outlets! You were a yin and yang of sorts. She had found herself a
success in the face of the struggle and thrived. Marcie exuded a greater
beauty than the day you were married. You, however, were the inverse of
this truth. Repeated failure in the face of trials had desecrated your
body, leaving you fat, balding, depressed, and bereft of purpose and
ambition. You were left rudderless in a storm.</p>
<p>Marcie had settled into a near daily fitness regimen which had left her
abs marvelous -- like smooth rolling hills over a plain. Unfortunately,
those wondrous hills were hidden beneath the shell of her lime tank top.
Each of her legs were incredibly strong, yet somehow retained their
feminine features and ran up to her hips which we still wonderfully wide
and it all worked together to give her a backside that made many of her
friends jealous. You had to admit that it was one your favorite things
about her body -- besides her piercingly pale blue eyes that could
convey cerulean pools of affection or icy glacial daggers when you had
said something stupid or upsetting.</p>
<p>From her legs, you raised your eyes to her chest were her small breasts
hung snugly within her sports bra. They were noticeable, yes, but they
had been a sore point for her throughout much of her teen years. You had
always told her that you loved for who she was -- mind and body as they
were. Yet, Marcie had always felt that breasts were the most prominent
indicator of one's femininity, and the lack of such a clear indicator
had taken her significant time to work through.</p>
<p>Finally, you brought your eyes to rest on the profile of her wonderfully
petite face. It's delicate form had only made those cerulean pools feel
even larger. Her nose was quite feminine and she had a smile that was
undeniably warm and comforting. All she had to do was flash a quick,
genuine smile and anyone's problems would simply melt away. It was her
nuclear option when you both in a fight -- you couldn't stay mad in the
midst of such authentic joy despite the conflict. This was the
superpower that ultimately drew her to you, and yet its magic felt as if
it was no longer effective as the year lurched on for you.</p>
<p>Yet, as you beheld her, Marcie was none the wiser. She was fully
enamored by the cornucopia of life bursting before her. You snapped,
yelled, and yet nothing registered to her. She was fully engaged, eyes
focusing in and out, zooming back and forth, navigating the trails that
led her only deeper into the forest. She was gone.</p>
<p>Defeated for the moment, you took one last look at yourself, repulsed by
what the quarantine had formed you into, and returned your gaze to the
decorative masterpiece. It felt new, fresh, different somehow -- like it
had opted to reorganize itself into something wholly new, yet still
unchanged. It felt alive.</p>
<p>You turned your eyes back to the great tree and a similar feeling soon
embraced you, one of feeling lost, yet of also, paradoxically, of being
found. Your senses now feel foreign, yet familiar. The shape of the tree
is still there with its blossoming fountains of color contrasted against
the lichen hues of the bark of the tree. The minor details were still
there, but you were certain that they had undergone a mild transition.
That road sign had certainly said 'Exit 3' and not 'Exit 43'. The cars
had been primarily shades of blue and not red had they not? Had the
tulips become daisies or was that always the truth? Was the past truth
or was the present truth?</p>
<p>And as your mind reeled from the chaos of impossible changes and
alterations, running without concern or care along the highways of the
arbor maze, you couldn't help but feel the gentle touch of invisible
tendrils seizing your eyes. Slowly, you worked your way through the
maze, much as you were prone to do on the diner menus while you waited
for food. You felt lost, yet strangely fully aware of your journey
through the maze. It felt like chaos, yet ordered.</p>
<p>You weren't sure how long you were lost for. No matter how you try, you
can't shake yourself free or even close your eyes to refresh them. They
were an uncompliant student as your reason attempted to be the educator.
Out of the periphery, reality itself had seemingly melted away. The
dining table was no longer a conception in your mind. To think of the
thing would be to try and pull material out of vapor. Even your Marcie
was gone -- only you and the masterpiece existed. Reality was nothing
beyond just the bizarre visual dance between you and your non-sentient
partner.</p>
<p>The choreography was simple -- eyes to the obelisk that was being
revered by people, then to the orchards and its seeming miles of
nourishing fruits, to the prison like structure on the opposite end of
the image, and then to visually inhale the crimson that seeped from
everywhere. To inhale the red was to get lost in its dizzying embrace
only to come back to the obelisk. That was his dance. Obelisk. Orchard.

<p>The longer you engage in the ballet, the more erotic the images seem to
become. The red was no longer dizzying because of the violence of its
fury, but rather it was hot, like silk sheets rolling in mad passion in
on themselves. The prison ceased to be a prison but mutated into a crib.
No longer had hardened looking criminals fill it, but jovial infants.
The orchard was no longer ripe with oranges, apples, pomegranates, and
more, but budding breasts hung from their branches. Then there was the
obelisk. That object of affection and devotion had slowly morphed into
something phallic in nature during their dance. Further, the people
beneath it in worship were no mere people, but beautiful visages of
Venus herself in various incarnations.</p>
<p>Your eyes couldn't break away, no matter how much you tried. The dance
was like a ritual. No longer did it feel like the graceful swaying and
movement of the start, but not it was deep, primal, aggressive, and
driving. Phallus. Breasts. Crib. Heat. Those movements are a visual
mantra -- some obtuse incantation that feels wholly unnatural and yet
comfortably normal. Fear was present, but only for the briefest of
flashes, like dark lightening flashing across your mind as its storm
passed and retreated to some foreign place. You can feel the tendrils
soothing your</p>
<p>It was unbearably hot. Unconsciously, your arms begin to disrobe
yourself, almost like you were nothing more than a marionet guided by an
army of masterful hands. Each muscle, strung up to the thousand hands of
an invisible genius. Your sweat pools and coalesces as beads on your
skin, running like passionate rivers along the topography of your form.
Each new crescendo of those roiling waves of red brought a new heat
wave. Hotter and hotter. You can feel seeping into your bones and an
arousal ignites with fury deep within. The color oozed eroticism. You
can feel your mind drowning in it. Then, drowning became saturation,
which in turn became a marinade.</p>
<p>Yet, each time that red wave would hit, your eyes would gasp for fresh
air only to take in the obelisk-turned-phallus before you. It was an
object to be adored, worshipped. Your jaw unlocks and drool begins to
form. A foreign yearning from that arousing flame flares up from deep
within. You long to be one of the women in the painting, deep within the
throes of her phallus worship. Wanton lust wells up inside you like
spring, waiting to explode forth as a geyser just like the incarnations
before you.</p>
<p>To behold the obelisk was to being the tribal dance once more. The
breasts ballooned before you. They were the fruits of these vines -- of
various shapes, sizes, and forms -- each pleasantly delightful and
desirable. Oh, to be one of the trees, presenting your own fruits for
adoration and consumption. Your hands move once more, the invisible
strings still exerting their perfect skill. They had removed your
clothing long ago and now they found your chest. It was already soft
from the dereliction of the past year, but now they had at least felt
good.</p>
<p>The puppet master guided your hands and fingers with exquisite detail
while your eyes remained fix, prisoners of the dance. Your fingers
caress your chest, rolling with gentle and deft grace, dragging across
each pectoral in their own supporting dance. You feel your nipples for
the first time, hardened and stiff, a silent, seemingly impossible
breeze pirouettes across them. It feels delightful, as if it is the
first time they've partaken of touch, like the sense had been denied to
them for their entire existence.</p>
<p>Your hands continue their graceful movements, yet still rigid in their
adherence to the unknowable choreography woven by your invisible master.
Now your fingers join the pirouettes and take a brief moment to seize
and twist your newly discovered sensory center. Each tweak presents a
brief, seamless lift and then a resulting drop that leaves a slight
ripple on your chest as you feel the weight shift.</p>
<p>And so the dance of your hands continues. They grace the curvature of
what you know for certain are breasts forming, those feminine features
that that woman you knew had been so envious of. Your hands sashay back
and forth, giving a deep embrace of the flesh before lifting into the
air and plunging with precision to your new breasts sensitive tips. They
tweak, twist, lift, drop, and the ripple. Embrace. Sashay. Lift. Plunge.
Tweak, Twist. Lift. Drop. Ripple.</p>
<p>Embrace. Sashay. Lift. Plunge. Tweak, Twist. Lift. Drop. Ripple.</p>
<p>The ripple feels heavier this time. You can't see what happening, but it
feels meaningful. It is no longer the brief jiggle of your previously
masculine accumulations, but something delightfully satisfying.</p>
<p>Embrace. Sashay. Lift. Plunge. Tweak, Twist. Lift. Drop. Ripple.</p>
<p>Embrace. Sashay. Lift. Plunge. Tweak, Twist. Lift. Drop. Ripple.</p>
<p>Embrace. Sashay. Lift. Plunge. Tweak, Twist. Lift. Drop. Ripple.</p>
<p>Embrace. Sashay. Lift. Plunge. Tweak, Twist. Lift. Drop. Ripple.</p>
<p>Bigger this time. Fuller. More satisfying is that ripple. You can feel
it tug on you, like a gentle anchor.</p>
<p>Embrace. Sashay. Lift. Plunge. Tweak, Twist. Lift. Drop. Ripple.</p>
<p>Embrace. Sashay. Lift. Plunge. Tweak, Twist. Lift. Drop. Ripple.</p>
<p>Embrace. Sashay. Lift. Plunge. Tweak, Twist. Lift. Drop. Ripple.</p>
<p>The tweak feels exponentially more satisfying this time. Your vocal
chords emit a soft moan. Your voice is no longer what it was. It oozes a
sweet smokiness. Strawberries enveloped by campfire. The ripple pulls
harder.</p>
<p>Embrace. Sashay. Lift. Plunge. Tweak, Twist. Lift. Drop. Ripple.</p>
<p>Embrace. Sashay. Lift. Plunge. Tweak, Twist. Lift. Drop. Sway.</p>
<p>The changes feel as if they are gaining momentum, just your breasts are.
The ripple has become a jiggling, a swaying, like individuals on a
pendulum granted some freedom to move. Each tweak elicits a deeper, more
primal moan. The images of the painting come in and out of focus, yet
they progression is still there. Obelisk. Orchard. Prison. Red. Phallus.
Breasts. Crib. Heat.</p>

<p>They feel enormous now, shaming that girl you used to know. You have yet
to drink in what your chest has become, but it feels wonderful,
powerful, feminine. They were easily armfuls, their weight pulled on
your back. Yet, as the thought of back pain crept to the forefront of
your mind, the tendrils seized your shoulders and back, rubbing them,
massaging them, and then retreating, leaving behind strengthened and
reinforced mounds to assist in proudly presenting your billboard sign of
your new sex.</p>
<p>The blur of the images came back into focus on the crib. Children.
Reproduction. Were you meant to breed? You couldn't help but ponder the
thought as you continued your dance. To have a babe nursing from you, to
lactate, to take the aesthetic of your chest and also make it
functional. But then the was the act beginning the reproduction process.
The seduction of a male, the worship of his obelisk and letting it
explore the fruits of your orchard and the probe your innermost being.</p>
<p>The heat only exacerbates the feelings within you. Your hands change
their movement, one slithers slowly down your stomach -- taut, flat, no
smooth mountains like that other, but a gentle valley down the middle
pointing to a land overflowing with honey. Your hand discovers that
wondrous land and your form is rewarded with a surge of energy, it
pulsates through you, crackling at the tips of your breasts where the
puppet master promptly brings your opposite hand to. Now, your fingers,
guided by their sightless strings engage in a deep massage, a new dance
of your flesh.</p>
<p>Sensation courses over you, the sights have sounds and begin to allegro,
picking up in pace and fury. The honey land is being tilled furiously by
your hand while its opposite nurtures your breasts, giving the crackling
points of energy a moment of release. Your sweetly smokey moans join the
bass line of the orchestra. Faster and faster they move until you feel
the waters recede from the shore, a tsunami of pleasure is on the
horizon.</p>
<p>For a moment, you realize the strings are gone and your eyes are closed,
you've been given autonomy only to become ensnared with the pleasure.
You can't stop. You won't stop. The wave looms large, you can feel it
coming. It crashes and sweeps away everything of what was with it. You
are this now. A goddess. There are but ruins left of who came before and
they tell little of who he was. As the waters of pleasure overwhelm you,
the tendrils release their grip. Your eyes come back into focus.</p>
<p>You behold the masterpiece once more. The minor details are still there,
deeply erotic and embedded within the bark of the tree. Yet, the
moderate, human like shapes that the roots, branches, and vines made are
now clearer and you rest on one, rather two.</p>
<p>She is there, beatify and you recognize her has you. Her ass itself is
far larger than that girl you used to know. She is on her knees,
presenting her backside to the viewer, letting them drink in her
feminine folds. Following her up the backside, her hair is long, braided
in a long French braid. You immediately become aware of your own hair,
pulled tight on your scalp and hanging long down your back, touching the
incline that goes on to make up your rear. You instinctively know that
this is your leash, for the man to pull you with and you grant you mind
a moment to wander in lust.</p>
<p>Your eyes return to the depiction of you within the masterpiece. You
look up to your lover, that same look of worship and desire that the
patrons of the phallic obelisk had in their tiny eyes. Your tongue runs
along the ridges of his member, taking time to inhale his scent. As you
continue your ascension up the image, behold your lover. Masculinity
embodied in the flesh. Enormous, powerful, strong, rough, and yet gentle
and loyal. The tree makes out the details and he is gorgeous, a demigod
to match your own feminine pseudo-divinity.</p>
<p>Slowly, you can sense reality begin to bleed back in like ink on water;
it globs and wisps back into focus and there he stands, your
counterpart. You finally feel free of the masterpiece, but you yearn
deep inside for him to possess and ensnare you. The desire propels you
to embrace him, to run your smooth, delicate hands against the wonders
of the topography of his muscles. They cut sharply, steeply incline and
decline, they are simply wondrous. Your eyes drink him in. His chest is
large, like a grand mountain face that exudes strength. His core
something to behold, a collection of small canyons with rivulets that
guide your eyes to the object of your desire. Its enormous, thick, and
semi ready. Your hand caresses his testes, your mouth drools.</p>
<p>The touch of his hands stirs you from the spell he unknowingly put you
under. Your eyes shoot to his. Piercing pale blue eyes, deep cerulean
pools that convey a deep hot passion for you. They break for you to take
in your form and you seize the opportunity to finally inventory
yourself. And yet, there isn't much to see -- your enormous breasts,
each easily as large has his head, capable of smoothing him in the great
canyon that is your cleavage, obscure the rest of you. Looking through
the deep crevasse between your breasts, you can catch a glimpse of your
perfectly smooth stomach and the ridge line where your new sex resides.</p>
<p>His hands handle your bosom with gentle, yet firm care. His mouth finds
your nipples and you let out a gasp before forcing your hand to the back
of his head. His tongue swirls, its own little dance that kindles that
red hot fire deep within your loins. Your spare hand quickly finds its
home and begins its attentive care to your sex. You bring your mouth
next to his ear, exhale deeply next to and let out a slow, low moan
which he promptly returns with a grunt before breaking free of your
hand.</p>
<p>He looks at you briefly, your dear husband Marcus, as he pushes you
gently on the shoulders. You bite your lower lip, shooting him an erotic
grin. You don't resist, you have wanted this since you saw him towering
over you in the masterpiece. He is enormous and you take a moment to be
thankful for such a gift that you get to enjoy regularly. As your hand
continues to care for your own loins, your other finds his quickly
hardening shaft and rubs it. You take in its soft strength, you feel it
get harder and stronger in your hands.</p>
<p>You present it over your face, looking up deeply at him, smiling for a
moment for letting your tongue free and running it his full length.
Easily eight inches and satisfyingly thick. Your nose drinks in his
musk, allowing it to drive you even more mad with heat. As your tongue
approaches the tip, your mouth unlocks and takes him in, tongue dancing
on the tip. He lets out an appreciative, and pleasure filled moan. His
hand finds the back of your head and push you further down.</p>
<p>Your throat relaxes, allowing him more access to your mouth, tongue
continuing its dance down his shaft. No longer needing to stroke him,
your hand moves to massage the delicate fruit hanging from his obelisk.
Soon, he let you free and your mouth took over for your hand, tongue
massage, tasting, salivating over the fruit that would soon fill you.
And again, you brought your tongue back up the shaft, mouth enclosing on
him and moving back and forth. You can feel your chest move with your
head, swaying gently and with mass as you show him your devotion. And he
is very much appreciative of your service.</p>
<p>But soon, he breaks free from your mouth and you know the next. You heft
your enormous breasts, presenting them as an offering to him. You spit
and prepare your chest for his enormous erection. He wastes no time and
plunges deep into the canyon of your titflesh. The head of his obelisk
appears every now and then, you reward it with a quick lick before
furiously running your breasts up and down his shaft. You let them drop
and take him back in your mouth again, loving the taste.</p>
<p>He has other ideas and grabs your leash, pulling you up to him. He
guides you to the couch where he lays down and presents himself to you.
You mount him, looking at him. He drinks in your chest, hands exploring
and massaging them. You swear you feel them get even larger as he
smothers his face between them. Each breast dwarfing his head. For a
moment, he is lost in your chest and your confident he is in a kind of
bliss, high on your femininity.</p>
<p>You seize your opportunity, grabbing his manhood and positioning your
womanhood above it, slowly descending, feeling it stretch you in the
most satisfying of ways. You moan once more, eyes closed, biting lower
lip, as you take him in. Slowly, you begin to move your hips, rising and
falling on him. You can feel your ass quake with each downward thrust,
you take pleasure in how erotic you must look in that moment.</p>
<p>As you move up and down, you keep him smother in your chest. His tongue
blindly explores the exteriors of your breasts. His moans send a
pleasurable vibration as his rough hands massage the soft flesh. Yet,
none of it compares to the feeling of impaling yourself on him. You can
feel yourself get lost in the haze of pleasure. You relent your hold on
his head for but a moment and he takes the opportunity to counter you
and take control.</p>
<p>You first feel his hands seize your ass, digging deeply into the soft
flesh. Now he is guiding you, hefting you up and down, ramming himself
into you. You can't help but let out even louder moans as you fall
forward, breasts collapsing on his face. He quickly takes you, pushing
your hands around his shoulders to his neck as he swings his weight
forward, standing up, with himself still buried deep within you and he
pumps furiously.</p>
<p>You're getting fucked and you love it. You squeeze him tight, hanging on
as his legs furious thrust into you. You can feel your enormous chest
attempt to ooze out from the sides of your embrace, unable to compress
themselves any further. All you can do is moan and whisper, 'Fuck yes,'
into his ear.</p>
<p>He then deftly handles you. In that moment, you are aware of how small
you are compared to him. He pops you off of him and spins you. Your head
comes face to face with his member once more and you waste no time in
claiming your prize. It tastes decadent. His tongue brilliantly
navigates your feminine folds, driving you even more mad with lust.</p>
<p>You don't know how long you're suspended like that. It may have been
moments, or minutes, you can't tell. You were too busy pleasing him to
care about anything else. But he moved you once more, bending you over
that dining room table. Your chest spills across its smooth, cold
surface driving you mad. You can feel your ass on display, a billboard
advertising to your loving what to do next. Your juices march down your
legs which already feel weak from the pleasure. He teases you at first,
his manhood running between the canyon formed by your enormous ass. Then
the tip would appear for a moment, rubbing its way over your soft mound,
taking in your juices. It would slightly enter, and then dart back out.</p>
<p>'Fuck me,' is all you can breathe out. He teases no longer and plunges
himself in you. Your eyes go wide at the sensation, feeling stretched
again, in a whole new way. His hand takes your leash and pulls you back,
your head raised. He keeps pulling until your tits, yes, your tits on
full display, bouncing madly as he keeps thrusting into you. His fingers
find your mouth and you instinctively suck on them, desperately wanting
the real thing, but satisfied with the substitute while he continues his
lovemaking with.</p>
<p>Every now and then, those fingers would leave your mouth and smack you
from behind, you gasp, whimper, and moan at the pain, relishing in his
strength and your submissiveness. And he fucks you like for what feels
like a blissful entirety. Your chest bouncing wildly, his free hand
roaming your form, mouth, ass, chest, pussy, sowing wonderfully
maddening pleasure with each new visit.</p>
<p>Again, you feel the waters recede, farther this time than last time. The
wave is on the horizon, a behemoth. You don't even know if you'll
survive when it hits, but you're willing to risk it. You lean into him
even harder, matching his thrusts. One of your hands paws at your chest,
massaging the nipple, anything to make the wave hit harder and faster.</p>
<p>Then it hits and washes everything away with it. You scream out, 'Fuck
yes!' as your legs shake and buckle. He keeps you upright as he
passionately continues. You feel your vaginal lips clamp down on him and
erupt in their own torrent, that well spring of lust deep within you
finally breaking free. You pant, the pleasure taking an unforeseen toll
on you.</p>
<p>And then you hear him grunt as you continue to push back on him. 'Fill
me,' is all you can moan out. Your hand continues to massage your chest
as his thrusts pick up pace. He finishes, and you can feel the seed of
those delicate fruits fill you. The visage of the crib flashes across
your mind and you know what this one means. It has finally happened, and
you wouldn't have it any other way.</p>
<p>You feel weak and he carries you back to the couch, to hold you. You
gaze over to the masterpiece once more. You can now see yourself and
your husband in all the different positions on the tree. Whatever it
was, when he brought it home, it drove you mad with lust. Perhaps
because he was doing interior decorating for you? You don't know why,
but you are thoroughly satisfied.</p>
<p>He stirs and gets up, turns off the cameras. You just now noticed them.
You were so busy in your lovemaking that you had forgotten all about
them. When you lost your job, you decided to film yourself and then each
other. He loved the idea and the money you made was insane. You both
found ways to thrive while being trapped inside. They were there when he
took you while making dinner, those times in the shower, the morning
wake up sex, and now the most passionate sex you have ever had. They'll
be there when your pregnant and horny, when you chest gets even bigger,
and when your enormous. You smile, excited for what the future holds.</p>
<p>But for now, you rest, satisfied as you wait for the seed to take hold
and blossom within you. And, as that happens, Marcus will continue to
renovate the house. You can't wait to have guests over again and shoe
them that wonderful masterpiece.</p>
